            Can a Large Language Model play chess? Prompt it to move based on the board state, 
            hint it with legal moves, and it can make moves (though some struggle with instruction following) 
            and even explain its tactics or strategy.
            <br><br>
            But can LLMs make meaningful moves and win? 
            Let’s test them against a random player (a bot that picks legal moves randomly). 
            These Foundational Models, with their vast knowledge and reasoning abilities,
            should easily defeat a chaos monkey, right?

                - LLMs played as black against a Random Player (as white).<br>
                - 30+ game simulations for Random Player vs. LLM.<br>
                - Bottom rows in green demonstrate how a Chess Engine (Stockfish v17) fares against a Random Player.<br>
                - 1000 simulations for Random Player vs. Chess Engine and Random vs. Random.<br>

                <strong>Libraries and Dependencies Used:</strong><br><br>
                - <strong>chess:</strong> A Python library for handling chess game rules and basic operations, including board representation, legal move evaluation, and game state evaluation. This is not a chess engine runnig the actual caclulation of the best move.<br>
                - <strong>Microsoft Autogen</strong> is used as a backbone for LLM communication. It also implements the interaction between a Chess Board and custom agents like GameAgent, RandomPlayerAgent, AutoReplyAgent, and others for simulating different player types.<br>
                - <strong>Stockfish</strong> - the chess engine doing the actual best move calculation, used as a referrence to demonstrate what a real chess player's peformance is.<br>
                <br>
                <strong>Workflow:</strong><br><br>
                1. The game is initialized with a chess board and two players: a Random Player (as white) and an LLM (as black).<br>
                2. The game loop runs until a termination condition is met, such as checkmate, stalemate, or reaching the maximum number of moves.<br>
                3. Each player takes turns making a move. The Random Player selects a move randomly from the list of legal moves.<br>
                4. The LLM is prompted to make a move using a structured dialog, which includes actions like getting the current board state, retrieving legal moves, and making a move.<br>
                5. The game state is updated after each move, and the board is visualized if enabled.<br>
                6. Game statistics are generated and stored at the end of the game.<br>

<span style="color:green">Proxy (to Player_Black):</span>
You are a professional chess player and you play as black. Now is your turn to make a move. Before making a move you can pick one of the following actions:
- 'get_current_board' to get the schema and current status of the board
- 'get_legal_moves' to get a UCI formatted list of available moves
- 'make_move &lt;UCI formatted move&gt;' when you are ready to complete your turn (e.g., 'make_move e2e4')
Respond with the action.

                February 12, Legacy GPT-4, get_current_board vs. get_legal_moves<br>
                -------------------<br><br></span>
                The results for <strong>gpt-4-0613</strong> and <strong>gpt-4-32k-0613</strong> show they performed well, making zero mistakes and achieving numerous draws. 
                However, older GPT-4 models completely ignored the opportunity to request the board state (<strong>get_current_board</strong> action), instead relying solely 
                on the list of legal moves (<strong>get_legal_moves</strong> action) to make their moves immediately - mimicing the behavior of the random bot, mechanisitcally getting the list of moves and mechanistically picking one. Upon closer examination of outputs from few models, 
                it was observed that reasoning models (<strong>r1</strong>, <strong>o1</strong>/<strong>o3</strong>) predominantly used <strong>get_current_board</strong>, demonstrating confidence in their ability to decide 
                on a legal move without needing additional hints (by requesting <strong>get_legal_moves</strong>). For <strong>o3</strong> models, this confidence increased with higher reasoning effort. 
                The majority of "traditional" LLMs (<strong>GPT-4o</strong>, <strong>Claude 3.5 Sonnet</strong>) utilized both <strong>get_current_board</strong> and <strong>get_legal_moves</strong> before making a move.<br><br>

                Here are the ratios for the number of actions issued by models, get_current_board/get_legal_moves:<br>
                <ul>

                February 10, OpenAI o3-mini<br>
                -------------------<br><br></span>
                Testing <strong>o3-mini</strong> turned out to be a challenge, with plenty of errors. Some were timeout issues (tried 120 and 250 seconds), 
                something I haven't seen with supposedly weaker (in terms of infrastructure) <strong>Deepseek R1</strong>, and never observed when testing other OpenAI models through Azure.
                Had to ignore plenty of logs due to such interruptions.
                The other errors were due to the server dropping the connection during the generation of the reply, treating these issues as model errors and giving a loss...<br><br>
                - Only low and medium reasoning efforts have been tested; most of the high modes ended up with timeout issues. Might retest in the future.<br><br>
                - <strong>o3-mini</strong> at low reasoning effort (<strong>o3-mini-2025-01-31-low</strong>) didn't impress, performing at the level of <strong>Claude 3.5</strong>/<strong>GPT-4o</strong>, yet with plenty of errors.<br><br>
                - <strong>o3-mini-2025-01-31-medium</strong>, on the other hand, is an interesting case. It took place right between <strong>o1-preview-2024-09-12</strong> and <strong>o1-mini-2024-09-12</strong>, demonstrating way fewer mistakes, suggesting better steerability.<br><br>
                - <strong>o3-mini-2025-01-31-medium</strong>, unlike the <strong>o1</strong> models, didn't score a single loss. It also maintained a greater material count by the end of each game. Yet, it often struggled to complete games where it dominated (resulting in stalemates and insufficient material).<br><br>
                - Low reasoning mode produced almost 4 times fewer tokens than medium (676 tokens per move vs. 2535), still way more tokens than <strong>anthropic.claude-v3-5-sonnet-v1</strong> (80).<br><br>

                February 09, 2025: Google Gemini 2 Progress<br>
                -------------------<br><br></span>
                Google made great progress with their Gemini 2 models. While the preview models initially looked mediocre, they have now performed much better!<br><br>
                - On <strong>Feb 5, 2025</strong>, they introduced a release version of <strong>Gemini 2.0 Flash</strong> (<strong>gemini-2.0-flash-001</strong>), as well as a preview of the smaller <strong>Gemini 2.0 Flash Lite</strong> (<strong>gemini-2.0-flash-lite-preview-02-05</strong>).<br><br>
                - <strong>gemini-2.0-flash-001</strong> performed significantly better than the preview version from December.<br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;- <strong>gemini-2.0-flash-exp</strong> on average lasted for 86 moves, while <strong>gemini-2.0-flash-001</strong> lasted for 159 moves.<br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;- A similar improvement was observed for <strong>gemini-2.0-flash-thinking-exp-1219</strong> (which was at the bottom of the list) and <strong>gemini-2.0-flash-thinking-exp-01-21</strong> (which performed better but was still subpar).<br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;- <strong>gemini-2.0-flash-thinking-exp-01-21</strong> exhibited odd instability, often failing to produce replies and returning empty messages around 50 moves.<br><br>
                - <strong>gemini-2.0-flash-lite-preview-02-05</strong> was disappointing, performing worse in evaluations than local runs of <strong>Gemma 2 9B</strong> and <strong>27B</strong>.<br><br>
                - <strong>gemini-2.0-flash-001</strong> ranked near the top of the leaderboard, between <strong>Claude 3.5</strong> and <strong>GPT-4o</strong>, due to scoring 3 wins in 67 games.<br><br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;- However, I wouldn’t consider it equal to the top models from Anthropic and OpenAI. <strong>Gemini 2.0 Flash</strong> performed worse overall, achieving only 34% draws and suffering too many losses. It made mistakes too often and broke the game loop on average at 159 moves, whereas <strong>Claude</strong> and <strong>GPT-4o</strong> almost never broke the loop.<br><br>
                - Revisiting the ranking is necessary, as using Win Rate as the key metric can place models that are worse overall above better-performing ones.

                February 6, 2025: Amazon Nova, Tulu<br>
                -------------------<br><br></span>
                I had the opportunity to test a few models from December 2024. Amazon released their state-of-the-art Nova models: 
                <strong>amazon.nova-pro-v1</strong> and <strong>amazon.nova-lite-v1</strong>. Additionally, there was mention of "best-in-class" Tulu fine-tunes of Llama 3 models. 
                Unfortunately, none of these models lived up to expectations:<br><br>
                - <strong>Nova models</strong>: Both Pro and Lite versions performed poorly, 
                breaking the game loop at an average of just 11.76 moves for Pro and 4.62 moves for Lite.
                They exhibited poor steerability and stability. It’s difficult to understand how these models were rated
                so highly across various benchmarks during their presentation.<br><br>
                - <strong>Tulu</strong> (<code>llama-3.1-tulu-3-8b@q8_0</code>): As is often the case with fine-tunes, 
                Tulu performed worse than the original model. It overwhelmed responses with verbosity, generating 1996.33 tokens per 1000 moves compared
                to just 162.1 tokens for the original <code>llama3.1-8b</code> model.<br><br>

                January 24, 2025: x.ai's Grok<br>
                -------------------<br><br></span>

                - Added <strong>Grok-2</strong> results (<strong>grok-2-1212</strong>), and it scored 2 wins in 32 games.<br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp; - Latter I've added 17 more runs, no more wins, win rate and material diff went a bit down.<br><br>

                - Originally, I adhered to exactly 30 game runs per model. Recently, I have been conducting more runs
                where possible (and financially reasonable—some models can be extremely expensive).<br><br>

                - More runs to some models might provide them with an advantage.
                For instance, if a model is weak in chess and can barely score a single win, 
                additional runs increase the chances of an occasional win, giving this model
                an automatic edge over other models (potentially better all-around models)
                that consistently achieve draws.<br><br>

                - <strong>grok-2-1212</strong>, with a 6% win rate, places the model at the top of the list among
                other non-reasoning models (<strong>GPT-4o</strong>, <strong>Claude 3.5 Sonnet</strong>), yet it has a low draw rate.
                The reason for this is that <strong>Grok-2</strong> sometimes fails to follow instructions, 
                neglecting to pick the correct move from the list of legal ones (which it had responsibly requested).
                Could this be due to the tokenizer or some "SolidGoldMagikarp" out-of-distribution token
                combination?<br><br>
                
                - Despite this, <strong>Grok-2</strong> is an intriguing non-reasoning model. It maintained a positive 
                material count throughout the games (with a material difference of 2.63).<br><br>

                January 22, 2025: R1 Challenges o1, thinking "surrogates"<br>
                -------------------<br><br></span>
        
                Released on January 21, <code>DeepSeek-R1</code> made a significant impact by showing similar
                or even better performance than OpenAI's <code>o1</code> models across a range of math and
                coding benchmarks. All of this comes at a fraction of the cost when accessing
                their 671B model through their API. Besides, the model weights are open, and
                there are plenty of details about the training process—a stark contrast to
                OpenAI's secrecy regarding the <code>o1/o3</code> family of models. And that's not all! For
                those interested in local models, there are smaller "distilled" reasoning models
                at 70B, 32B, 14B, etc., sizes.<br><br>

                So far, none of the so-called reasoning or thinking models have come close to <code>o1</code>
                (<code>qwq-32b-preview</code>, <code>sky-t1-32b-preview</code>, <code>gemini-2.0-flash-thinking-exp-1219</code>). They
                were a step back in instruction following and could hardly be steered when
                compared to non-thinking models. Let alone, they didn't perform as well in chess.
                I call them surrogates, verbosity generators mimicking but not replicating <code>o1</code>'s
                behavior.<br><br>

                Deepseek-R1 (<code>deepseek-reasoner-r1</code>) was an extremely curious model to test, and
                now there are evaluation results in the Leaderboard.<br><br>

                Additionally, Google has just released an update to its Gemini 2.0 Thinking Model
                (<code>gemini-2.0-flash-thinking-exp-01-21</code>), which previously showed poor results. Two
                very interesting releases in two days...<br><br>

                <strong>NOTES:</strong><br><br>

                - There are now three models in a league of their own: <code>o1-mini</code>, <code>o1-preview</code>, and now
                <code>deepseek-reasoner-r1</code>. These are the only models with significant wins (&gt;10%) and
                maintaining a positive material difference (~9) as opposed to a negative material
                difference for the resetGameInterval.<br><br>

                - <code>deepseek-reasoner-r1</code> is much more verbose (almost twice as many tokens as <code>o1</code>) and
                also makes more mistakes. Many games were lost due to the model making mistakes,
                unlike <code>o1</code> models, which mostly fell out of the games due to losing or drawing
                (e.g., stalemate, insufficient material).<br><br>

                - <code>deepseek-reasoner-r1</code> showed distinctive behavior: sometimes it made moves without
                requesting the board state or legal moves list (i.e., issues make_move action in
                the very first response), sometimes it only requested the board state without
                getting the list of moves and decided on the move without a hint (in some cases
                picking the right move, in others wrong).<br><br>

                - Overall, <code>o1</code> models are better all-round models (compared to R1), with better chess
                performance, as well as instruction following (Mistakes) and Durability (not
                falling out of the games, doing more moves on average).<br><br>

                - The rest of the "thinking" models (<code>sky-t1-32b-preview@q4_0</code>, <code>qwq-32b-preview@q4_k_m</code>,
                <code>deepseek-r1-distill-qwen-32b@q4_k_m</code>, <code>deepseek-r1-distill-qwen-14b@q8_0</code>,
                <code>gemini-2.0-flash-thinking-exp-1219</code>) can hardly follow prompt instructions, lasting
                on average 2~14 moves.<br><br>

                - Distilled dense 14B and 32B versions of <code>Deepseek-R1</code> (<code>deepseek-r1-distill-qwen-32b@q4_k_m</code>,
                <code>deepseek-r1-distill-qwen-14b@q8_0</code>) did not impress—very poor instruction following,
                not even close to the full 671B MoE model. Could quantization have an effect?
                Don't know.<br><br>

                - Distilled R1 models use <code>&lt;think&gt;&lt;/think&gt;</code> tags to enclose
                "reasoning" tokens (those ones hidden for <code>o1</code>), sometimes they fail to put the
                opening <code>&lt;think&gt;</code> tag (most often in the very first reply).<br><br>

                - The new Gemini Thinking model (<code>gemini-2.0-flash-thinking-exp-01-21</code>) did improve a
                lot in instruction following. While the previous December version
                (<code>gemini-2.0-flash-thinking-exp-1219</code>) was almost useless, staying in the game on
                average for 2.3 moves (i.e., breaking instruction prompts in the 2nd move it was
                asked to make), the new model lasted on average 40 moves and showed far fewer
                mistakes.<br><br>

                In terms of chess, the newer <code>gemini-2.0-flash-thinking-exp-01-21</code> showed a negative
                material difference and negligible draw count—way below other non-thinking models
                (even Google's own Gemma 2 9B).<br><br>

                - <code>gemini-2.0-flash-thinking-exp-01-21</code> also demonstrated much less verbosity in the
                outputs, providing to-the-point answers. Didn't investigate it deeply, yet it
                seems that now Gemini Thinking does proper isolation of reasoning tokens. Per
                <a href="https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/thinking">docs</a>, "On a standard
                request, the model responds with two parts, the thoughts and the model response.
                You can check programmatically if a part is a thought or not by seeing if the
                part.thought field is set to True." Autogen doesn't seem to register thought
                tokens in completion stats for Flash Thinking while it does so for R1.<br><br>

                - Most of the failures/losses from <code>gemini-2.0-flash-thinking-exp-01-21</code> 
                were due to server errors. Occasionally, the server returned an empty message or flagged 
                the request with a "RECITATION" error, among others. 
                Clearly, there's some instability in generation on the server side.<br><br>

                - Earlier non-<code>o1</code> thinking models did not do well with splitting the reasoning/thinking part
                from the final answer, R1 and newer Gemini Thinking do that (yet it didn't help
                the distilled R1 models).<br><br>

                -------------------<br>
                January 21, 2025: More Models, More Tests<br>
                -------------------<br><br></span>
                - Added the new Claude 3.5 Sonnet (<code>claude-v3-5-sonnet-v2</code>) and also retested the previous version (<code>claude-v3-5-sonnet-v1</code>), giving them more runs
                (60 this time). What surprised me was not just the fact that <code>v2</code> showed some wins, but that <code>v1</code> demonstrated even more wins 
                (although losing to the random player more often). 
                Back in November, when I did 30 runs of Sonnet 3.5, there were 0 wins. 
                Did Anthropic change something in <code>v1</code> as well, or was it just a question of stochasticity?
                <br><br>
                - Conducted more runs of GPT-4o models (<code>gpt-4o-2024-05-13</code>, <code>gpt-4o-2024-08-06</code>, <code>gpt-4o-2024-11-20</code>). The August version also achieved a win, yet
                it also had its first non-zero mistake (previous 30-run result had a perfect 0 mistakes) - this time, that happened due to Azure's content
                filter halting one of the games.
                <br><br>
                - OpenAI's and Anthropic's models are still the most durable models, i.e.,
                demonstrating the least number of mistakes, staying in almost all games
                until the very end without falling off due to a random glitch/hallucination
                or breaking the prompt instructions. Clearly, it is a challenge for most models
                to sustain a 100-turn (200-move game) with an average of 3-4 dialog interactions per game turn. 
                <br><br>
                - Deepseeks R1 distilled into 32B Qwen (<code>deepseek-r1-distill-qwen-32b@q4_k_m</code>) didn't perform well
                - barely able to move past a couple of turns in the chess game, no better than <code>QwQ</code> or Flash Thinking.
                <br><br>
                - <code>o1</code> models are still special being the only models maintaing positive material diff (gaining more piaces rather than losing them)
                versus most other models having a significant negative diff suggesting the wins for non-<code>o1</code> models can hardly be attributed
                to models reasoning performance (i.e. with the models meaningfully moving the pieces rather than faking a game).
                <br><br>

                January 16, 2025: First wins by non-reasoning model<br>
                -------------------<br><br></span>
                The November 2024 update to <code>GPT-4o</code> demonstrated a few wins, something non-o1 models couldn't do before. Yet, what is curious is that the updated
                model not only scored wins but also lost to the Random Player more often than others.
                <br><br>
                <span style="color:white;">
                -------------------<br>
                January 14, 2025 : Reasoning Models, First Wins<br>
                -------------------<br><br></span>
                In my initial notes (see below), I expressed skepticism about LLMs ever being capable of achieving meaningful wins against a Random Player 
                (let alone a dedicated chess engine). I also mentioned the ARC Challenge as a similar benchmark that is difficult or unsolvable by LLMs.
                Yet, in late December 2024, OpenAI introduced their o3 model, which excelled in 
                <a href="https://arcprize.org/blog/oai-o3-pub-breakthrough">ARC-AGI-1</a>.<br><br>
                Around the same time, I received API access to o1-mini, and it was impressive! o1-mini scored 9 wins in 30 games (30%), 
                making it the first model
                capable of meaningful chess games. Next, I tried o1-preview, achieving an even more impressive 46.7% win rate.<br><br>
                The o1 models did something different; they played a meaningful game rather than randomly moving pieces on the board as 
                seen with older "non-reasoning" models. They formed a league of their own—a "strong" model capable of winning.<br><br>
                I also tested a number of other reasoning models introduced after o1—Google's Gemini 2.0 Flash Thinking (via API), 
                QwQ 32B (4-bit quantized via LM Studio), and Sky T1 32B (also 4-bit quantized via LM Studio).
                The results were underwhelming, to say the least—those 3 models couldn't complete even a single game, often failing 
                after a few moves (due to breaking the communication protocol or making illegal moves).
                Just like the o1 models, they produced lots of tokens, yet unlike o1, 
                which seems to have 2 separate stages—thinking (those hidden tokens) and producing the 
                final answer—the other "thinking" models just stream lots of tokens without caring about 
                following any instructions as to what they are asked to produce.
                Verbosity and failing to adhere to instructions seem to plague not just the o1 competitors 
                but also newer models (e.g., check Deepseek v3).<br><br>
                <strong>NOTES:</strong><br><br>
                - When LLMs achieve a 90% win rate against a Random Player, I will replace it with Stockfish.<br>
                - You can find conversation logs for 
                o1-mini <a href="https://github.com/maxim-saplin/llm_chess/blob/main/_logs/no_reflection/_21.12.2024_o1-mini-2024-09-12/output.txt">here</a> 
                and for o1-preview <a href="https://github.com/maxim-saplin/llm_chess/blob/main/_logs/no_reflection/_03.01.2025_o1-preview-2024-09-12_2/output.txt">

                - While o1 models used a lot of tokens (1221 tokens per move for o1-mini and 2660 
                for o1-preview vs. below 100 tokens for an average model), their replies were concise (most of the tokens 
                were hidden ones) and had few mistakes.<br><br>
                - OpenAI models might have an advantage over other models because the prompts have been crafted with GPT-4 models.
                This might explain why many models perform worse. Contrary to this point, there are non-OpenAI models (e.g., Anthropic)
                that do not struggle with instruction following. I believe the factor of prompts and adjusting prompts for each specific model plays a minor role.<br><br>
                - An idea: while other (non-o1) reasoning models might be poor instruction followers, why 
                not introduce a deliberate step of final answer synthesizing? I.e., use a cheaper LLM (e.g., 4o-mini) 
                to get the long scroll from a reasoning model and prompt it to produce a final answer. 
                Will the reasoning models show better chess abilities?

                Language Models can make moves in a chess game, but they cannot actually play chess or progress towards a victory. 
                The experiment started after taking a class at DeepLearning, which taught the Microsoft Autogen framework. One of the classes demonstrated
                a simulation of a chess game between LLMs. I was immediately intrigued by the idea of putting different LLMs head-to-head in a chess game competition. 
                However, I was surprised that the naive prompting strategy from the class never led to a game completion. Extending prompts didn't help. 
                I ended up testing LLMs' performance in a chess game using a Random Player. A human player with reasonable chess skills would have no problems winning 
                against a random player, yet LLMs failed miserably in this competition.
                <br><br>
                I suspect that crushing this "LLM Chess" eval might be as hard as the <a href="https://arcprize.org">ARC Challenge</a>—a benchmark created to demonstrate 
                the true nature of text-generating LLMs, exploit their weaknesses, and show how LLMs struggle with reasoning. "It's easy for humans, but hard for AI."
                <br><br>
                LLMs and Transformer-based models can be trained specifically to play chess. There are projects on the internet where people have fine-tuned LLMs
                as chess players. Yet, those are specialized models that can't be good chat models.
                <br><br>
                I am looking forward to testing new releases of SOTA and frontier models. It would be great to see a model that starts scoring wins against
                the chaos monkey while maintaining performance at traditional chat tasks.

                <strong>NOTES:</strong><br><br>
                - More data on game simulations is available <a href="https://github.com/maxim-saplin/llm_chess/blob/main/docs/_data/refined.csv">here</a> and 
                <a href="https://github.com/maxim-saplin/llm_chess/blob/main/docs/_data/aggregate_models.numbers">here</a>.<br><br>
                - No history of moves is available to LLM, no reflection used (giving the model "time to think").<br><br>
                &nbsp;- Experiments with reflection suggest that LLMs do even worse when they are prompted to evaluate options before making a move
                (<a href="https://github.com/maxim-saplin/llm_chess/blob/main/_logs/_not_OK_logs/reflection/aggregate_results.csv">reflection results</a>).
                &nbsp;- Could LLMs improve their performance if given the whole log of the game?<br><br>
                - The chess engine ( <a href="https://stockfishchess.org">Stockfish</a>) has a 100% win rate with an average game taking 32 moves to complete.<br><br>
                &nbsp;- Stockfish 17, macOS, 0.1ms time limit (vs 0.1s default) - with decreased performance, Stockfish dominates over Random Player.<br><br>
                - Random Player (as white) wins over Random Player (as black) in 10.5% of cases - LLMs scored 0 wins.<br><br>
                &nbsp;- Indeed, giving the right of the first move gives an advantage to the white player.<br><br>
                &nbsp;- LLMs do worse than random players.<br><br>
                &nbsp;- It's as if an LLM had no goal to win, as if it was its intention to keep the game going. What if I prompted it and told it that 200 moves is the maximum and the game ends after? Would it try harder? Can adding to a system prompt an explicitly instruction to Win help?<br><br>
                - While some models are less verbose and follow the rules strictly (e.g., OpenAI), others are verbose.<br><br>
                &nbsp;- Initially, I used exact match when communicating with an LLM and prompted it to reply with action names (show board, get legal moves, make move) - worked well with OpenAI.<br><br>
                &nbsp;- After the list of models was extended, the original prompts had issues steering them.<br><br>
                &nbsp;- As a result, I changed the communication protocol to use regex and be tolerant to reply format, doing its best to extract action and arguments from LLM replies.<br><br>
                - Since models don't score any Wins there must be some alternative metric demosntrating game progress.<br><br>
                &nbsp;- For the time being using Draws, the more draws - the better.<br><br>
                &nbsp;- Yet most of the draws scored are due to hitting the 200 max moves limmit and hence the metric demonstrates the adherence to communication protocol/prompt cpnverntions.<br><br>
                &nbsp;- Logs also contain "Material Count" metrics - the weighted scores of piaces a player has, at the beginning a player has a total of 39 units of material.<br><br>
                &nbsp;- Material difference could be a good metric to evluate progress, the player having more material left as the game progress is at a better position.<br><br>
                &nbsp;- Yet most of the models demonstrated negative material difference and one of the models (gpt-35-turbo-0125) failed to make a single move having a material difference at 0 putting it above models that had negative material while staying in the game much longer.<br><br>
                &nbsp;- It might be resonable to create a computed metric that account for both the material and length of the game, addressing the endless pointless game concern, as well as never changing material diff due to failing to early.<br><br>
                - What if the model is not given the list of legal moves? Will the model figuring out legal moves on their own and struggle to progress? Can giving the models a list of legal moves essentially break reasoning turning the game into simple instruction following (i.e. pick one item from the list rather than win in the game)?<br><br>
                - The older GPT-4 Turbo did better than newer GPT-4o version, this is a yet another eval demonstrating how newer models performed worse supporting the claim the the 4o family of models are smaller and cheaper to run models.<br><br>
