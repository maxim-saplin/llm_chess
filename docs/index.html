            Can Large Language Models play chess? <span style="color: white;">Let's find out ツ</span>
            <br><br>This leaderboard evaluates <span style="color: white;">chess skill</span> and <span
                style="color: white;">instruction following</span>
            in an agentic setting:
            LLMs engage in multi-turn dialogs where they are presented with a choice of actions (e.g., "get board" or
            "make move") when playing against
            an opponent (Random Player or Chess Engine).
            <br><br>
            In 2024, we began with a <em>chaos monkey</em> baseline — a Random Player that chooses legal moves at
            random.
            At the time, most models could barely compete and lost either due to an inability to follow game
            instructions
            (i.e., hallucinating illegal moves or taking incorrect actions) or by dragging the game to the 200-move
            limit because they
            couldn't win.
            <br><br>
            In 2025, more capable reasoning models nailed both instruction following and chess skill.
            We've added the <strong>Komodo Dragon</strong> Chess Engine as a more capable opponent, which is also
            Elo-rated on
            chess.com. This allowed us to anchor the results to a real-world rating scale and compute an Elo rating for
            each model.

                <strong>METRICS:</strong><br><br>
                <strong>- Player:</strong> Model name (playing as Black). Models that also played vs Dragon are marked
                with an asterisk in superscript (e.g., 3*).<br>
                <strong>- Elo:</strong> Estimated Elo anchored by Dragon skill levels and calibrated Random. We solve a
                1D MLE over aggregated blocks (opponent Elo, wins, draws, losses) and report ±95% CI. When both Random
                and Dragon data exist, they are combined. Empty Elo appears for extreme 100% win/loss or no anchored
                games.<br>
                <strong>- Win/Loss:</strong> Difference between wins and losses as a percentage of total games (0-100%);
                reflects BOTH chess skill and instruction following. 50% ≈ equal wins/losses.<br>
                <strong>- Game Duration:</strong> Share of maximum game length completed (0-100%); measures
                instruction-following stability across many moves.<br>
                <strong>- Tokens:</strong> Completion tokens per move; verbosity/efficiency signal.
                <br><br>
                <strong>ARRANGEMENT & SOURCES:</strong><br><br>
                - Primary sorting: Elo (DESC), then Win/Loss (DESC), Game Duration (DESC), Tokens (ASC).<br>
                - Data sources mix Random-vs-LLM and Dragon-vs-LLM games. Dragon levels map to Elo and provide the
                anchor; Random is first calibrated vs Dragon and then used as an opponent for many models.<br>
                - Elo ratings are not comparable across player pools, i.e. you can not compare chess.com Elo to FIDE
                Elo<br>

                <strong>MATRIX VISUALIZATION:</strong><br><br>
                This plots shows LLM chess players based on two key metrics:<br><br>
                <strong>- X-Axis:</strong> Game Duration (0-100%) - Shows how well models maintain correct communication
                protocols throughout the game. Higher values indicate better instruction following ability.<br><br>
                <strong>- Y-Axis:</strong> Win Rate (0-100%) - The metric is less strict than Win/Loss (Non-Interrupted)
                used in the leaderboard as it ignores technichal losses due to poor instruction following. Higher values
                indicate better chess strategy and decision making.<br><br>
                <strong>INTERPRETATION:</strong><br><br>
                - <strong>Top-Right:</strong> Models with both excellent chess skill and instruction following.<br>
                - <strong>Top-Left:</strong> Models with good chess skill but struggle to maintain communication
                protocol.<br>
                - <strong>Bottom-Right:</strong> Models that follow instructions well but make poor chess moves.<br>

                <strong>Libraries and Dependencies Used:</strong><br><br>
                - <strong>chess:</strong> A Python library for handling chess game rules and basic operations, including
                board representation, legal move evaluation, and game state evaluation. This is not a chess engine
                running the actual calculation of the best move.<br>
                - <strong>AG2 (aka Autogen)</strong> is used as a backbone for LLM communication. It also implements the
                interaction between a Chess Board and custom agents like GameAgent, RandomPlayerAgent, AutoReplyAgent,
                and others for simulating different player types.<br>
                - <strong>Stockfish</strong> - the chess engine doing the actual best move calculation, used as a
                reference to demonstrate what a real chess player's performance is.<br>
                <br>
                <strong>Workflow:</strong><br><br>
                1. The game is initialized with a chess board and two players: a Random Player (as white) and an LLM (as
                black).<br>
                2. The game loop runs until a termination condition is met, such as checkmate, stalemate, or reaching
                the maximum number of moves.<br>
                3. Each player takes turns making a move. The Random Player selects a move randomly from the list of
                legal moves.<br>
                4. The LLM is prompted to make a move using a structured dialog, which includes actions like getting the
                current board state, retrieving legal moves, and making a move.<br>
                5. The game state is updated after each move, and the board is visualized if enabled.<br>
                6. Game statistics are generated and stored at the end of the game.<br>
                <br>
                <strong>Dialog:</strong><br><br>
                Here is an example of a dialog that prompts a model to make a move. UCI format refers to Universal Chess
                Interface notation, which uses source and destination squares (e.g., e2e4 means move from e2 to e4):<br>

<span style="color:green">Proxy (to Player_Black):</span>
You are a professional chess player and you play as black. Now is your turn to make a move. Before making a move you can pick one of the following actions:
- 'get_current_board' to get the schema and current status of the board
- 'get_legal_moves' to get a UCI formatted list of available moves
- 'make_move &lt;UCI formatted move&gt;' when you are ready to complete your turn (e.g., 'make_move e2e4')
Respond with the action.

                1 move = 1 dialog. The dialog is limited to 10 turns (10 pairs of Proxy/Agent Request/Response
                messages). A maximum of 3 mistakes (not conforming to
                communication notation, picking wrong action or wrong move) are allowed per dialog.
                The game is terminated and LLM is given a loss if the max turns OR number of LLM mistakes is reached in

                perform best.
