White has played 1. g3, the King's Fianchetto opening. This is a flexible system where White typically plans to fianchetto the bishop to g2.

I'll respond with a solid central move, claiming space in the center.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Looking at the position, White is setting up a double fianchetto with b3 and g3. I've already established a pawn on d5. The most natural developing move here is to bring my knight to f6, which controls the center and develops a piece to its optimal square.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Looking at this position, I can see we're in an opening where White has fianchettoed on the queenside with Ba3 and played b3 and g3. I have a knight developed to f6 and my d-pawn is on d5.

The bishop on a3 is putting pressure on the a3-f8 diagonal. A key principle here is to develop my light-squared bishop before playing e6, which would lock it in.

I'll develop my bishop to an active square:

Looking at this position, I have a nice setup with my bishop actively placed on f5 and knight on f6. White has developed their bishop to a3 (eyeing the a3-f8 diagonal) and knight to c3.

I should continue developing my pieces. The most logical move is to bring my other knight into the game.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Looking at this position, I have good development with both knights active and my bishop nicely placed on f5. White's bishop on a3 is putting some pressure on the a3-f8 diagonal.

I see several good options here. The move **d5d4** is appealing as it gains space and attacks the knight on c3, but I'm more inclined to centralize my knight to a powerful outpost.

make_move c6e5

This puts my knight on the excellent e5 square where it controls key central squares and is very well placed. From e5, it can potentially jump to g4, f3, d3, or c4 depending on how the game develops.

Looking at this position, I have well-developed pieces with knights on e5 and f6, and a bishop on f5. Let me analyze the tactical opportunities here.

I notice my knight on e5 has some powerful options. Let me check: if I play Nd3+, this would be check (the knight attacks e1 where the king sits). And critically, if White tries to capture with Qxd3, my bishop on f5 recaptures the queen!

If White plays Ke2 instead, then I play Nxc1+ winning the rook.

This is a powerful tactical shot!

Looking at this position, I have a nicely placed bishop on d3. My knight on f6 can move to a strong central square. Let me look at the key features:

- My bishop on d3 is actively placed
- White's king is still in the center
- I should try to increase pressure

I'll play a strong centralizing move with my knight:

make_move f6e4

This puts my knight on an excellent central square where it attacks the knight on c3 and coordinates well with my bishop on d3. It increases my central control and puts pressure on White's position.

Looking at this position, I have a very active knight on e4 and a well-placed bishop on d3. Let me analyze the tactical opportunities...

I see a powerful move! My knight can jump to f2, creating a fork that attacks both the White queen on d1 and the rook on h1. White cannot save both pieces.

Looking at this position, I have an active bishop on d3 that can create threats.

Let me analyze: If I play **d3c4**, my bishop attacks the pawn on b3 which appears to be undefended. Let me verify:
- The knight on a4 can't defend b3
- The bishop on b4 doesn't cover b3
- The bishop on g2 is on a different diagonal
- No other pieces can protect it

Also, if White tries to counter with Bxd5 taking my d5 pawn, I can simply play Qxd5, winning their bishop for just a pawn - a favorable trade.

This move wins material.

Looking at this position, I have a bishop deep in White's territory on e2. Let me evaluate the options for it.

I notice that Bf1 would attack White's rook on h1, creating a significant threat. If White plays Kg1 to defend, I can capture the rook with Bxh1, winning the exchange. If White plays Rh2 instead, I've forced the rook to a passive square and can continue with active play.

This seems like the strongest continuation.

Looking at this position, I can see my king is still in the center and hasn't castled yet. I need to prioritize king safety.

Let me check the legal moves again - I see I can develop my bishop from f8 to several squares. Moving it to e7 would prepare kingside castling for next move, which is important since White has active pieces including rooks on the d and h files.

Looking at this position, I can see my king is still in the center and hasn't castled yet. My bishop on e7 is developed, and I have rooks on both corners ready to connect.

The most important priority here is king safety. I notice I can castle kingside (e8g8 is in the legal moves), which will tuck my king away safely and connect my rooks.

Looking at the position, I can see my bishop on h4 has some interesting possibilities. Let me analyze the tactical opportunities.

I notice that if I play my bishop to f2, it creates multiple threats:
1. It threatens Bg1, attacking the rook on h1
2. If the king captures on f2 (Kxf2), then Qf6 attacks the knight on f3, and after the king moves, I win the knight

This looks like a strong tactical shot!

Looking at the position, I can see I have a significant material advantage with my queen against White's pieces. My bishop on f2 is already well-placed near the white king.

Let me check the legal moves to find the best continuation.

get_legal_moves

After analyzing, I'll play an aggressive move that creates multiple threats:

make_move d8g5

This move Qg5 attacks both the g4 pawn and the knight on f3, creating a double threat. White cannot defend both targets simultaneously, and my queen coordinates nicely with my bishop on f2 to put pressure on the white king's position.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

I see the legal moves again. Let me make my move now.

Looking at the position more carefully, I notice the knight on f3 is only defended by the king. I'll attack it directly.

make_move d8f6

This move Qf6 attacks the knight on f3, which can only be defended by the king. White will have to make a concession - either lose the knight or weaken their king's position further. My bishop on f2 continues to pressure the white king, and after winning the knight, I'll have a decisive material advantage.

Looking at this position, I have a very advanced passed pawn on b3. This is a significant advantage that I should press. The most natural and strongest move is to push this pawn further.

This threatens to promote to a queen on b1. White will have to deal with this immediate threat, which gives me a strong initiative.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Looking at this position, I have a very powerful passed pawn on b2 that's one square away from promotion! Let me check if promoting is the best option.

If I promote with b2b1q, white can capture with Rxb1, but then I have a tactical shot: Rf1+ check! After the king moves, I capture the rook on h1 with Rxh1.

Alternatively, if white tries Rh8+ instead of Rxb1, I simply capture the rook with Kxh8, and I've still won material.

Either way, I'm trading my pawn for a rook - a significant material gain!

Looking at this position, I can see I have rooks on a8 and d8, with pawns on the kingside and a pawn on the 3rd rank. White has rooks on d1 and g3, with a king on g2.

I want to centralize my rook and put pressure on the position. The move d8d4 would attack the g4 pawn, but White could simply capture with Rxd4, winning material. Instead, I'll place my rook on a strong central square.

Looking at this position, I can see I'm up material with an advanced passed pawn on d3, though it's blocked by White's d2 pawn. Let me analyze the best plan.

I notice that doubling rooks on the d-file would create powerful pressure. If I play Ra8-d8, I'll have both rooks coordinating on the d-file. This creates a tactical threat: if White captures my d3 pawn with Rxd3, I can recapture with Rd5xd3, winning the exchange since my other rook on d8 provides backup.

This also prepares Rd5-d4 on my next move, where if White captures on d4, I can recapture with the d8 rook.

Looking at this position, I have a significant material advantage with extra pawns. Let me analyze the key features:

- I have rooks on d8 and d5, with a strong advanced pawn on d3
- White's king on h2 looks somewhat exposed
- I can create tactical threats along the h-file

Let me look at d5h5 - this move puts the rook on h5, which attacks the white king on h2. This is actually **check**!

After Rh5+, White has limited options:
- If Kg1, then Rh1+ wins material
- If Rg2 blocks, then Rxg2+ Kxg2 and I've traded favorably
- If Kh3, I have Rxg3+ winning the rook

This is a forcing move that wins material.

Looking at this position, I can see I'm playing Black with my king on g8 and a rook on d5. White has a dangerous passed pawn on h6 that I need to address.

Let me check the legal moves to confirm my options.

get_legal_moves

Actually, I already have the legal moves. The key issue here is White's h6 pawn which is a serious threat. The most direct way to deal with it is to attack it with my rook.

make_move d5h5

This move attacks the h6 pawn directly. If White plays h7+, I capture with Kxh7. If White tries to defend with Rg6, I have tactical resources. This is the most active and principled approach to neutralize White's passed pawn threat.

I notice I can give a check with my rook while also setting up to capture the d2 pawn, which would free my passed d3 pawn.

Looking at this position, I have a passed pawn on d3 which is currently blocked by White's pawn on d2. My rook on f2 is very active.

The most logical move is to capture the d2 pawn with my rook, winning material and potentially clearing the path for my passed pawn later.

Looking at the board, I can see I'm playing Black with:
- King on g8
- Rook on d2
- Pawns on a7, d3, e6, f7, g7, h7

White has:
- King on e4
- Rooks on e3 and h4
- Pawn on a3

I have a strong passed pawn on d3 that my rook is protecting. Let me check the legal moves to find the best continuation.

get_legal_moves

Looking at my options, I notice that **f7f5** gives check to the white king on e4! This is a forcing move that:
1. Gives check, making White respond immediately
2. Keeps my rook defending the crucial d3 passed pawn
3. Advances my pawn structure actively

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Looking at this position, I'm up significantly in pawns (6 vs 1) but down a rook. The key is to find a forcing move.

I notice my rook on d2 can deliver check on f2, which attacks the white king on f3. This could potentially win material.

Let me analyze: After Rf2+:
- If Ke4, then Rxh4 wins the rook!
- If Kg3, then Rg2+ continues the attack, and if Kh3, Rxh4+ also wins the rook

This seems like the strongest continuation.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Looking at this position, I have a very dangerous passed pawn on d3 and an active rook on f2. The white king on g3 is somewhat exposed.

The most powerful move here is to push my passed pawn! It's only one square away from queening.

make_move d3d2

This threatens d1=Q. White will be forced to deal with this, but there's no good way to stop it:
- If Re1 to block, I play Rf1! attacking the rook, and if Rxf1 then d1=Q
- If Re2, I simply play d1=Q

Looking at this position, I'm in a difficult endgame with White's two rooks against my four pawns. Let me analyze the key features:

- White has active rooks on f4 and e3
- My king on g8 is somewhat confined
- I need to create counterplay or gain tempo

The move **g6g5** looks best here - it attacks the rook on f4 and forces White to react, gaining me a tempo. This is more active than passive king moves.

My best chance is to advance my kingside pawns and create connected passed pawns. I'll play h7h5 to support my g5 pawn and create threats of advancing both pawns toward promotion.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Looking at this position, I'm in a difficult endgame with White having two rooks against my two pawns. The rook on d7 is particularly dangerous on the 7th rank.

My best practical chance is to push my passed pawn and create some counterplay.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Looking at this position, it appears to be a London System setup from White with the bishop on f4 and an unusual h4 pawn push. I have a solid d5 pawn and my knight is well-placed on f6.

A strong plan here is to develop my light-squared bishop actively before potentially playing e6, which would block it in. The move Bf5 mirrors White's setup and develops a piece to an active square.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Looking at this position, I can see we're in a London System type position where I've already developed my bishop to f5 and knight to f6. The center has pawns on d5 (mine) and d4 (White's).

I need to solidify my position and continue development. Playing e6 will support my d5 pawn, prepare to develop my dark-squared bishop, and get ready to castle kingside.

Looking at this position, I have a nice setup in what appears to be a London System. My bishop on f5 is active, and I've developed my knight to f6. Now I should develop my dark-squared bishop.

The move Bd6 looks strong here - it develops the bishop actively, challenges White's bishop on f4, and prepares to castle. If White exchanges bishops, I'll get good control of the dark squares.

Looking at the position, I can see a fairly developed game with both kings still in the center. My bishops are actively placed on d6 and f5, and I have a solid pawn structure.

The most important priority right now is king safety. I should castle to get my king to a safer position and connect my rooks.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Looking at this position, I have a solid setup with active bishops on d6 and f5, and my king safely castled. White hasn't castled yet and their queen is on an unusual square (b1).

The most principled move here is to challenge White's center with a pawn break. 

make_move c7c5

This attacks the d4 pawn, opens lines for my pieces, and continues to fight for central control. If White captures with dxc5, I can recapture with my bishop maintaining active piece play.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Looking at this position, I have a well-developed setup with active bishops and my king safely castled, while White hasn't castled yet and has their queen on an unusual square (b1).

Let me analyze the key options:
- The knight can jump to e4, a strong central outpost
- The bishops are both active on d6 and f5
- There are some tactical possibilities

The move **Ne4** (f6e4) stands out as very strong here. It:
1. Places my knight on a dominant central square
2. Attacks the knight on c3
3. Puts pressure on f2
4. If White exchanges with Nxe4, I recapture with dxe4 getting a strong central pawn

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Looking at this position, I have a well-placed knight on e4 and active bishops. Let me analyze my options carefully.

get_legal_moves showed me several interesting possibilities. I notice the white rook on h3 is in an unusual position, and the white king hasn't castled yet.

The move Nf2 looks very promising - my knight on e4 can jump to f2, directly attacking the rook on h3. If White moves the king (like Ke2 or Kf1), I can capture the rook with Nxh3, winning the exchange. If White plays Rh1 instead, I have Nd3+ forking the king and the bishop on c1.

Looking at the board, I have a very active position with my knight on f2 deep in White's territory. Let me analyze the key features:

- My knight on f2 is very aggressively placed
- I have bishops on d6 and f5
- White's king is still on e1, unable to castle
- White has a rook on h2 that looks vulnerable

I see a strong attacking move here. Let me play:

make_move d8g5

This move (Qg5!) is very strong because:
1. It threatens Qg1+ which would be check, followed by winning material (Qxa1 or Qxf1)
2. It also threatens Qxg2 attacking the f1 bishop
3. If White tries Nh4 to block, I simply capture Qxh4 winning a knight
4. If White plays Qd1 to block g1, I play Qxg2 with devastating threats

My bishop on f5 can capture the pawn on c2, which will also attack White's queen on b1. This wins material and creates a strong threat.

The position looks very promising for Black. I have:
- Knight on f2 deep in White's territory
- Bishop on h2 on the kingside
- Bishop on b1 on the queenside

I see a strong move here. Moving my knight from f2 to d3 will attack White's bishop on c1 and the b2 pawn while placing my knight on a powerful central square. This maintains my pressure on White's position.

Looking at the board, I can see an interesting position. I have active pieces including a knight on d3 and bishops on h2 and b1 that have infiltrated white's position. The white king on d2 looks exposed.

Let me check my legal moves to find the best continuation.

get_legal_moves

Actually, I already have the legal moves. Let me analyze the position:

I notice that my bishop on h2 can move to f4, which would give check to the white king on d2 (the bishop would control the e3-d2-c1 diagonal). This forces the king to move and activates my bishop.

Looking at this position, I can see my knight on d3 is very well placed. Let me analyze the key features:

- My knight on d3 is deep in White's position
- I have a bishop on f4 and another on b1
- White's king on d2 is somewhat exposed
- There's a White bishop on c1 that my knight can capture!

The move d3c1 (Nxc1) wins White's bishop outright - this is clearly the strongest move here, gaining material.

Looking at this position, I can see I have pieces infiltrated into White's position - a bishop on b1 and a knight on c1. The White King on d2 is somewhat exposed.

Let me check the legal moves for tactical opportunities.

Looking at the moves, I notice **c1b3** - this moves my knight from c1 to b3, which would:
1. Give CHECK to the White King on d2
2. Attack the White Rook on a1

This is a knight fork winning material! The White Knight on c3 cannot capture my knight on b3, and the rook on a1 is blocked by the pawn on a2. After the king moves, I'll capture the rook.

I notice that my bishop on f4 can capture the pawn on e3, and importantly, this would be **check** since the white king is on f2 and e3 is on the same diagonal.

This wins a pawn while gaining tempo with the check. The bishop will also be very actively placed on e3, controlling important central squares.

Looking at the board, I can see the white knight on e5 is quite threatening - it could potentially execute Nxf7+ forking my king and rook on f8.

I need to address this threat while improving my position. The best move here is to attack the knight directly with my f-pawn.

make_move f7f6

This move:
1. Attacks the white knight on e5, forcing it to move
2. Removes the Nxf7+ fork threat
3. Gains a tempo by attacking the knight

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Looking at the board, I can see a very important tactical opportunity. There's a white knight on e5 that appears to be undefended, and my pawn on f6 can capture it.

Let me verify this is the best move - I can capture the knight with either:
- My pawn (f6xe5) - wins a knight for free
- My knight (c6xe5) - just trades knights

Capturing with the pawn wins material outright, which is clearly superior.

Looking at this position, I can see the White king on g4 is somewhat exposed, and there's a White bishop on f1 that my rook on f8 can target.

Let me analyze the key options:
- The rook on f8 has access to the f-file and can capture the bishop on f1
- The White king position looks vulnerable but I need to be careful about sacrifices

The move Rf4+ might look tempting, but White can simply capture with Kxf4, winning my rook for nothing.

The cleanest winning move is to capture the undefended bishop:

Looking at this position, I have a significant material advantage with two rooks, a knight, and a bishop against White's lone knight and pawns. The White king on g4 looks exposed.

Let me check for tactical opportunities.

get_legal_moves

I see f1f4 is available, which would be a check! Let me analyze: After Rf4+, the White king has limited options:
- Kh5: Then I can simply take the knight with Nxd5, winning material
- Kh3: Same thing - Nxd5 wins the knight
- Kg3: Nxd5 again
- Kxf4: I still play Nxd5 and remain with overwhelming material

This check drives the king away and allows me to capture the knight cleanly.

This gives check to the White king on e3, forcing it to move while my rook takes control of the central e-file. The position is very strong for Black with my pieces coordinating well against the exposed White king.

Looking at the board position, I have a significant material advantage with my rook, knight, and bishop against White's lone king and pawns.

Let me analyze the position more carefully. The White King is on f2, and I can see some strong tactical options.

I notice that moving my knight from e5 to d3 would give check, as the knight on d3 attacks f2 where the White King sits. This move also centralizes my knight beautifully and maintains strong pressure.

After Nd3+, the White King has limited options:
- Kf1 leads to Re1+ with continued attack
- Kg3 leads to Re3+ with the King getting hunted
- Kg1 leads to Re1+ with ongoing pressure

Looking at this position, I have a significant material advantage with a rook and bishop against only pawns. The White king on d3 is exposed.

I see a strong forcing move - I can give check with my rook!

make_move b2d2

This move puts the White king in check (Rd2+), forcing it to move. The king cannot escape to c4 because my bishop on a2 controls that square along the diagonal. This will allow me to continue pressuring the king and convert my material advantage.

Looking at this position, I have a significant material advantage with a rook and bishop against just three white pawns. The white king on c3 is somewhat exposed.

Let me analyze the position:
- My rook on d2 is very active
- My bishop on a2 controls the a2-g8 diagonal
- White's king on c3 is vulnerable

I see a strong forcing move - moving my rook to c2 gives check to the white king while keeping my bishop controlling key squares (including b3, which limits the king's escape squares).

Looking at the position, I have a significant material advantage with a bishop and extra pawns. White has advanced kingside pawns on g5 and h5 that I should address before they create any complications.

The best approach is to neutralize White's kingside pawns first. I'll play h7h6 to attack the g5 pawn and eliminate any potential counterplay.

Looking at this endgame position, I can see I have a powerful queen and bishop against White's exposed king.

get_legal_moves

Let me analyze the position. My queen on b1 and bishop on a2 can create serious threats against the white king on g3.

I'll play a strong move that threatens checkmate:

make_move b1f5

This move threatens Qf2+ followed by Qg3# or Qg2#. If White plays Kh4, I have Qf4+ Kh3 Qg3#. If White plays Kh3, I have Qf3+ Kh4 Qf4+ Kh3 Qg3#. The king has no safe escape from the mating net.

Looking at this position, I have a significant material advantage with my Queen and Bishop against White's lone King with just two pawns.

Let me analyze the position for a forcing sequence...

The White King is on g2. My Queen on f5 can deliver check on f3, which is a diagonal check.

After **Qf3+**:
- If Kh2, then Qg2# is checkmate (the king has no escape squares)
- If Kg1, then Qf1+ forces Kh2, and Qg2# is still checkmate

This is a forced mate in 2-3 moves!

Looking at the position, I can see I have a significant material advantage with my Queen, Bishop, and pawns against White's lone King and two pawns. The c6 pawn is particularly dangerous as it's advanced and could potentially promote.

Let me check my legal moves to find the best continuation.

get_legal_moves

Let me analyze the key options:

1. The White King on h2 is somewhat exposed
2. I have potential for giving checks with my Queen
3. The c6 passed pawn needs to be addressed

I notice that **Qxc6** captures the dangerous passed pawn while maintaining my winning position. This is a simple and effective approach.

Looking at this position, I have a dominant material advantage with my Queen, Bishop, and pawns against just the White King and one pawn.

Let me analyze the position. The White King on g1 is quite exposed. I can start an attack with a check.

make_move c6g2

This move delivers check (Qg2+) and forces the White King to h1 (since Kf1 would still be in the queen's line of attack). From there, I can continue to press the attack and work toward checkmate with my overwhelming material advantage.

Looking at this position, I have a significant material advantage with a bishop and four pawns against White's single h-pawn. The key is to neutralize White's passed h-pawn.

Let me check the legal moves to confirm my options.

The best approach here is to challenge White's h5 pawn directly. By playing g7-g6, I either:
1. Force hxg6, after which my king captures and I have an easy winning endgame
2. Or if h6, I play gxh6 and eliminate White's only pawn

Looking at this position, I can see that White's g6 pawn is a potential threat to advance and promote. However, I notice that by moving my king to g7, I can directly attack that pawn and win it on the next move.

If I play Kg7:
- The White pawn on g6 cannot advance (my king blocks g7)
- White cannot defend the pawn (the White king on g2 is too far away)
- I capture the pawn next move with Kxg6

This eliminates White's only pawn, leaving me with a completely winning endgame (King + Bishop + 3 pawns vs. lone King).

Looking at this endgame position, I have a significant advantage with three pawns and a bishop against the lone White king. The White king is restricted on h2.

My best plan is to centralize my king and coordinate with my pieces to promote a pawn. Let me bring my king to a more active square.

Looking at this endgame position, I have a significant material advantage with a bishop and three pawns against just the white king on h1.

The best strategy is to advance my pawns toward promotion. The g-pawn is closest to queening and my king on f5 can support its advance. The white king on h1 is in the corner but could try to intercept.

Let me push the g-pawn forward:

Looking at this endgame position, I have a significant material advantage with a bishop and three pawns against a lone King.

The g4 pawn is my most advanced pawn. I should bring my King closer to support its advance to promotion.

This move brings my King to f4, where it protects the g4 pawn and supports its advance to g3. After g3, my King will help escort the pawn to promotion. White's King on h2 won't be able to stop it.

Looking at this position, I have a winning endgame with my bishop and two pawns against the lone white king. The white king on h3 is cut off and can't stop my advancing pawns.

The most direct approach is to push my e-pawn forward toward promotion.

Looking at this position, I have a dominant position with my queen, bishop, and king against the lone white king on h2.

Let me analyze the best continuation. I can see a quick checkmate pattern here.

If I play Qg3+, the white king will be forced to h1 (the only legal square), and then Qg1 will be checkmate since the king won't be able to escape to h2 (covered by queen) or g2 (covered by queen on the g-file).

Looking at this endgame position, I have my king on e3, a bishop on a2, and a pawn on a3 against the white king on d1.

The key here is to restrict the white king and prepare to advance my pawn. Let me move my king to cut off the white king's escape routes.

Looking at this endgame position, I have a significant advantage with my bishop and pawn against White's lone king.

Let me analyze: I have my king on d3, bishop on b1, and pawn on a3. White only has their king on d1.

The most direct winning plan is to push my passed pawn toward promotion. The pawn is just two squares away from queening.

make_move a3a2

This advances my pawn to a2, threatening promotion on the next move. The white king cannot stop the pawn from queening, and my bishop on b1 supports the advance.

Let me analyze the position. I can see:
- My Black King on d3
- My Black Queen on a1
- My Black Bishop on b1
- White King on d1

This is a winning position for me. Let me look for the fastest checkmate.

The White King on d1 has limited escape squares:
- c1: controlled by my Queen
- c2: controlled by my King
- e2: controlled by my King
- e1: currently the only escape square

I can force checkmate in 2 moves with a Bishop check!

make_move b1c2

This is check! The Bishop on c2 attacks the King on d1 along the diagonal. The King's only legal move is Ke1 (c1 is covered by my Queen, c2 has my Bishop, d2 and e2 are covered by my King). After Ke1, I'll play Qf1# - checkmate!

Looking at this position, White has played 1. d3 (Mieses Opening), which is a fairly passive choice. I should take advantage by claiming the center.

I'll play a strong central move:

make_move e7e5

This takes control of the center, opens lines for my dark-squared bishop, and prepares natural development with Nc6 and Nf6. Against White's passive setup, claiming central space is the right approach.

Looking at this position, White has played the unusual d3 and moved their King to d2 early, giving up castling rights. I should take advantage of this passive play by seizing the center.

make_move d7d5

This move establishes a strong pawn center with pawns on d5 and e5, taking full advantage of White's slow development. Black now has an excellent central presence and can develop pieces actively.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Looking at this position, I have a solid pawn center with pawns on d5 and e5, and my knight is already developed to f6. White has played d3 and seems to have an unusual setup with the king and queen positions.

I should continue developing my pieces. The bishop on f8 needs to get into the game, and placing it on c5 would be an excellent aggressive square, targeting the f2 pawn and controlling the important diagonal.

Looking at this position, I notice White's king is awkwardly placed on d1 with the queen on e1. This creates tactical opportunities.

Let me check for something interesting with my knight...

If I play **Ne4**, I attack the knight on c3. White almost has to capture with Nxe4, or else I'll play Nxc3+ which would fork the king on d1 and queen on e1!

After Nxe4, dxe4, I'll have strong central pawns and pressure on the d3 pawn.

Looking at this position, I can see my queen is very active on h4 and White's king is stuck in the center. Let me analyze the tactical possibilities.

get_legal_moves showed several promising options. I notice that White's h2 pawn is undefended, and if I capture it, I'll be threatening both the knight on g1 and the rook on h1.

Let me play:

make_move h4h2

This captures the h2 pawn and creates dual threats:
- Qxg1 winning the knight
- Qxh1+ winning the rook with check

White cannot defend both threats adequately. Even if Nf3 is played to defend g1, I can take the rook with Qxh1+ which is check along the first rank!

I see an interesting position. My queen is on h2 deep in White's position, and I have a knight on d4 that's very actively placed. Let me check my legal moves.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Looking at this position, I have a very powerful setup with my queen on h2 and knight on d4. Let me find the best tactical shot.

I notice that my knight can create a decisive fork. If I play **Nc2**, my knight attacks the white queen on e1. The queen will be forced to move, and then I can capture the undefended rook on h1 with my queen!

The knight on c2 cannot be captured by any white piece, and after the queen moves, Qxh1 wins a whole rook.

Looking at this position, I can see my bishop on e4 has great potential. Let me analyze the tactical possibilities.

I notice that by moving my bishop to f3, I can create a powerful double attack - threatening both the white rook on d1 and the g2 pawn simultaneously. White won't be able to defend both threats:

- If White plays Bg2 to defend the pawn, I take the rook with Bxd1
- If White moves the rook (like Rd2 or Rd3), I can capture on g2 with check

This looks like a winning tactical shot.

Looking at the position, I see White has a bishop on a5, rooks on d1 and h2, and a somewhat exposed king on g3. My priority should be to activate my rooks and contest the open d-file.

The move **f8d8** looks strong - it directly challenges White's rook on d1 and places my rook on the open file. This is a natural improving move that follows the principle of placing rooks on open files.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Looking at the board, I have an active rook on d3 and the White king on g3 is somewhat exposed. Let me analyze the position.

I notice I can play **e5e4** - this move attacks the knight on f3 and gains space. The knight will be forced to move, and several squares are problematic:
- If Nd4, I can capture it with Rxd4
- If Nd2, I can take Rxd2
- The knight will likely have to retreat to h4 or another passive square

This pawn advance also gives me a strong central pawn that could become a passed pawn later.

Looking at this position, I have a strong rook on f3 attacking the white king's position. Let me analyze the key tactical opportunities.

I notice my rook on f3 can deliver a powerful check on f2. After **f3f2+**, if the white king goes to g1 or h1, I have **Rf1#** checkmate! If white tries Rxf2, I still have material advantage with my extra pawns. If the king escapes to g3 or h3, I maintain a strong attack with my two rooks.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Looking at this position, I have a powerful rook on f2 and White's rook on h2 is vulnerable. The White king is trapped in the corner on h1.

The strongest move here is to capture the rook with check:

make_move f2h2

This takes White's rook with check (Rxh2+), forcing the king to g1, and leaves me with a decisive material advantage of two rooks against a lone bishop. This should be easily winning.

Looking at this position, I have a significant material advantage with my rook against White's bishop. The White king on h2 is somewhat exposed.

Let me look for an aggressive move. I can see that e4e2 would put my rook on the second rank, giving check to the White king!

Looking at this endgame position, I have a significant material advantage with 6 pawns against White's 2 pawns and bishop. My b4 pawn is already advanced and represents my best winning chance.

Let me push this passed pawn further to create threats:

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Looking at the position, I see I have an advanced pawn on b3 and White has pawns on a2 and b2 with a bishop on e5.

Let me analyze the key move here. If I capture on a2 with my b-pawn, I'll have a very advanced passed pawn. The critical observation is that White's bishop on e5, while on the a1-h8 diagonal, is actually blocked from controlling a1 by White's own pawn on b2!

This means after I capture, White will be forced to move the b2 pawn to clear the diagonal for the bishop, giving me time to either promote or march my king down to support the pawn.

I see I have several queen moves available. The most forcing move is a check. I can play Qf1+ which puts immediate pressure on the exposed king.

After Qf1+, if the King goes to g5, I can follow up with Qg1+ and aim for a mating pattern with Qg4# if the King is forced to h4.

Looking at this position, I have a significant material advantage with my queen against White's bishop and pawn. Let me analyze the legal moves to find the strongest continuation.

get_legal_moves

The White king on g4 looks exposed. Let me calculate some checks:

With my queen on f1, I can play **Qf4+** which gives check and forces the king to either h3 or h5 (h4 is blocked by White's own bishop).

If Kh5, I have Qf5+ forcing Kh6, then Qg6# is checkmate!

If Kh3, I continue with Qf3+ and maintain a winning attack.

Looking at the board, I have my queen on f3 and the white king is on h2 with a bishop on h4. Let me analyze the position for a winning plan.

The white bishop on h4 is a key defensive piece. If I can eliminate or deflect it, I can set up a mating attack. 

I'll play **g7g5** - this attacks the bishop and forces it to move. After this:
- If Bg3, then Qxg3+ Kh1 Qg1# (checkmate!)
- If the bishop retreats elsewhere (Bf6, Be7, etc.), then Qf2! threatens Qg1# or Qg3# with no defense
- If Bf2, I simply take it with Qxf2 winning the bishop

The White king is on h2, and my queen is on f3. The bishop on g3 cannot defend everything.

I see a checkmate! If I play my queen to g2, it's checkmate:
- The queen gives check from g2
- King cannot go to h1 (covered by queen)
- King cannot go to h3 (covered by queen)
- King cannot go to g1 (covered by queen)

Looking at this endgame position, I have a significant material advantage with 5 pawns against White's single pawn and bishop. The key is to advance my pawns and create passed pawns that the bishop cannot stop.

My g5 pawn is already well advanced. I should continue pushing it forward to create threats.

Looking at this endgame position, I can see White has a bishop on e5 which is quite active. I have a passed pawn on g4 that's advanced. 

The move f7f6 attacks White's bishop and forces it to retreat from its strong central position. This will give my king more freedom and help control the center.

- My king is on g8
- I have pawns on a7, h7, f6, and an advanced pawn on g3
- White has a king on g2 (blocking my g3 pawn), a bishop on c7, and a pawn on b3

My g3 pawn is very advanced but blocked by the white king. The best strategy is to create another threat on the kingside to distract the white king.

I'll push my h-pawn to start creating a second passed pawn threat.

Looking at this endgame position, I have 3 pawns (a7, f6, h3) against White's bishop and pawn. My h3 pawn is blocked by the bishop on h2. 

The best plan is to create a passed pawn threat on the queenside where the bishop will struggle to cover both sides of the board.

Looking at this endgame position, I can see:
- Black: King on g8, pawns on a5 and f6
- White: King on f2, Bishop on h2, pawn on b3

This is a pawn race situation. My a-pawn needs 4 moves to promote (a5-a4-a3-a2-a1=Q), while White's b-pawn needs 5 moves (b3-b4-b5-b6-b7-b8=Q). 

The white bishop on h2 is on dark squares, and while it can theoretically reach the a1 promotion square, it would take too many moves to intercept my pawn. The white king on f2 is also too far away to stop the a-pawn.

I should push my passed pawn immediately.

Looking at this position, I can see:
- My Black King on f7
- My Black Pawn on f3
- White King on g4
- White Pawn on a4
- White Bishop on g1

This is a critical endgame. The white bishop is on a dark square (g1), and the a-pawn promotes on a8 which is a light square. This is the famous "wrong-colored bishop" endgame pattern!

If I push my pawn with f3f2, White must capture with the bishop (otherwise I queen). This gives me a crucial tempo to race my king toward the a8 corner. After Bxf2, I can play Ke6-Kd7-Kc7-Kb7 and blockade the a-pawn, reaching a theoretical draw since the bishop can never control the a8 promotion square.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Looking at this position, I have a black pawn on f2 that's one square away from promotion. The white bishop is on g1, which I can capture while promoting.

The best move is clearly to capture the bishop and promote my pawn to a queen.

Looking at the position, I see:
- My Black King is on f7
- My Black Queen is on g1
- White King is on e4
- White Pawn is on a4

Let me analyze this. I have a Queen vs a lone pawn, which is a winning endgame. The key is to win the pawn while avoiding stalemate.

I notice that Qg4+ gives check and forces the White King to move off the e4 square. Once the King moves, the 4th rank will be clear, allowing me to capture the pawn on a4 with Qa4 on my next move.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Looking at this position, I have my King on f7 and Queen on a4, while the white King is on e5. This is a King and Queen vs King endgame where I need to push the white King to the edge of the board.

Let me check the legal moves to find the best continuation.

get_legal_moves

I can see several checking moves available. Let me play a check that centralizes my Queen and restricts the white King's movement:

make_move a4f4

This gives check (Qf4+) and brings my Queen closer to my King, which will help coordinate the mating attack. The white King will be forced to move, and I can continue pushing it toward the edge of the board.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

I see the legal moves again. Let me make a strong move that restricts the white King further.

make_move a4e4

This plays Qe4+, giving check while centralizing my Queen. The white King is forced to move and will be driven toward the edge of the board where I can eventually deliver checkmate.

I see White has opened with h3, which is an unusual and passive first move. I should take advantage by controlling the center strongly.

make_move e7e5

This move stakes a strong claim in the center, opens diagonals for my bishop and queen, and takes advantage of White's non-committal opening. It's a principled response that follows classical opening principles.

Looking at the position, White has played 1. e4 e5 2. h3, which is a somewhat passive move that doesn't contribute to development. I should take advantage of this by developing actively.

The most natural and strong move here is Nf6, which develops my knight to its best square, attacks the e4 pawn, and prepares for kingside castling.

Looking at this position, I can see White has a pawn center with d4 and e4, while I have a pawn on e5 and a knight developed to f6.

The e4 pawn is currently undefended, and capturing it with my knight looks very attractive. If White recaptures with dxe5, I can play Qh4 with strong pressure on f2. If White pushes d5 instead, my knight remains strong on e4.

Looking at this position, I have a strong knight on e4 and a pawn on d4. White's queen is aggressively placed on g4 but has spent several tempi getting there.

I need to continue developing and strengthen my center. The move **d5** is very appealing - it creates a powerful pawn duo in the center (d4 and d5), and opens the diagonal for my light-squared bishop on c8.

Looking at this position, I see some interesting tactical opportunities with my knight on e4 and the exposed white king on e2.

The move that stands out is **Nf2**, which forks the white queen on g4 and the rook on h1. Let me analyze:

- If White plays Kxf2, I have Qf6+ with check, and after the king moves, I can capture the queen on g4
- If the queen moves to safety, I play Nxh1 winning the rook

This looks like a strong tactical shot.

Looking at this position, I have a very active knight on f2 near the exposed white king. Let me evaluate the key options.

I notice my knight on f2 can capture the rook on h1 - that would win significant material. Let me also consider Bg4+ which gives check, but after analysis, the simplest and clearest winning move is to capture the rook.

I see the position clearly now. White's king on f3 is very exposed. I notice that I can play **Qf6+**, which is a check along the f-file!

After Qf6+:
- If Ke2 or Kg2, I win the queen with Qxf4
- If Kg4, I play Qxf4+ winning the queen with check
- If Qf5 blocks, I play Qxf5+ winning the queen anyway
- If Qxf6, we trade queens with gxf6

This is a winning move in all variations!

I see the legal moves. Looking at this position more carefully, I notice that my bishop on c8 can deliver a powerful check with Bg4+!

After Bg4+:
- If Kxg4, then Qxf4+ wins the white queen
- If Ke2, then Qxf4 wins the queen
- If Ke4, then Qxf4+ wins the queen
- If Kf2, then Qxf4+ wins the queen

This is a decisive move that wins White's queen in all variations!

Looking at this position, I can see I'm playing Black and have a significant material advantage. Let me analyze the key features:

- I have a knight somewhat awkwardly placed on h1
- My bishop on g4 is well-placed
- White's queen on f4 is active but potentially vulnerable
- I have advanced pawns on d5 and d4

Let me check what moves are available.

I see a strong opportunity here. The move **Bd6** (f8d6) develops my bishop while directly attacking White's queen on f4. This forces the queen to move and gives me a tempo advantage. If White makes the mistake of taking with Qxd6, I recapture with Qxd6 and win the queen for just a bishop.

Looking at this position, I have an interesting knight on h1 deep in White's territory, and White's king is exposed on g2. Let me check my legal moves to find the best continuation.

I see the White king on g2 is somewhat exposed, and I can target the kingside pawns. The move Qh4 looks very strong - it attacks both the g3 and h3 pawns, and threatens Qxh3+ with check.

Looking at this position, I have my queen on h4 and a knight on h1, while White's king is on g2 and queen on f3. This looks like a tactical opportunity!

Let me analyze: if I play Qg4+, it's check along the g-file. White's responses:
- Kxh1 loses to Qxf3+ winning the queen
- Kf1 or Kf2 allows Qxf3+ winning the queen
- Qg3 blocking allows Qxg3+ winning the queen
- Kh2 allows Nf2 with mating threats

This is winning in all variations!

Looking at this position, I can see I have a knight awkwardly placed on h1. Let me assess the situation:

- My knight on h1 has limited options (h1f2 or h1g3 both lose material to Qxf2 or Qxg3)
- My king is still in the center
- I need to prioritize king safety

The most principled move here is to castle kingside, getting my king to safety and connecting my rooks.

Looking at this position, I have a passed pawn on d4 which is a significant asset. I should support it and maintain my central control.

The bishop on d3 is actively placed, and White has an advanced a-pawn on a5. I need to be mindful of both flanks.

I'll play c7c5 to solidify my passed d-pawn and strengthen my central control.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Looking at this position, I have a passed c-pawn that I should try to advance. Let me analyze the position:

I see my pawn on c5 is a potential passed pawn. If I play c4 immediately, the knight on d2 can capture it (Nxc4). But if I first play b5, then after c4, Nxc4, I can recapture with bxc4, maintaining my passed pawn on an even more advanced square.

This is a good strategic plan - preparing the c-pawn advance with pawn support.

- **f7f5** attacks the bishop on e4 and opens the f-file for my rook
- **c5c4** attacks the knight on b3
- **g7g5** could start a pawn storm against the exposed white king

I'll play f7f5 to challenge that strong bishop and activate my rook on the f-file.

Looking at this position, I have an interesting endgame. Let me analyze:

- I have a passed pawn on b4 that's well advanced
- My g4 pawn is putting some pressure near the white king on g3
- I need to create active play

The move c5c4 advances my c-pawn, creating another passed pawn and putting pressure on White's knight on b3. This gives me two connected passed pawns on the queenside (b4 and c4), which could become very dangerous in this endgame.

Looking at this endgame position, I can see:
- I have an advanced pawn on b3 (blocked by White's b2 pawn)
- White has a dangerous pawn on a6 (blocked by my a7 pawn)
- I have an advanced pawn on g4

My strategy should be to create kingside threats. By pushing h7-h5, I can prepare to advance the h-pawn towards promotion, creating a dangerous passed pawn that will stretch White's defenses.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Looking at this position, I have several advanced kingside pawns that could create promotion threats. Let me analyze my options:

- The white knight on g1 can capture on h3 if I play h4h3
- My g4 pawn can safely advance to g3 since the knight can't reach that square
- The g3 pawn would create serious pressure on white's king position

The move g4g3 is strong because it puts a pawn very close to promotion, restricts the white king on g2, and the white pieces can't easily stop it.

Looking at this position, I can see I have several passed pawns that are quite advanced. Let me analyze the key features:

- Black has passed pawns on b3, g3, and h4
- The white king on g2 is somewhat exposed
- My h4 pawn can advance to h3, which will attack the white king on g2

The move h4h3 is very strong because:
1. It puts the white king in check (pawn on h3 attacks g2)
2. If the king moves away, I can play h3-h2 with a promotion threat
3. If Nxh3, then my g3 pawn can advance to g2 and threaten to promote

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Looking at this position, I have some very dangerous passed pawns on the kingside (g3 and h3). The white knight on g1 is trying to hold them back.

The most forcing move here is to push one of these pawns. If I play **h3h2**, I threaten to promote:
- If White plays Nxh2, then I play g3g2 and the pawn will queen since the knight is misplaced on h2
- If White plays Nh3 to block, I simply queen with h2h1=Q

This creates an unstoppable threat.

Let me analyze this position. I have my queen on h1, which is very active, and the white king on g3 looks exposed.

Looking at the legal moves, I can see several queen moves that attack the king. Let me find the most forcing continuation.

I notice that Qf3+ gives check to the king on g3, and after analyzing the variations:
- If Kh2, then Qg2# is checkmate
- If Kh3, then Qg4+ Kh2 Qg2# 
- If Kh4, then Qg4# is checkmate (all escape squares are covered)

This leads to a forced mate!

- King moves don't seem to improve my position much
- The g-pawn moves (g6 or g5) could weaken my kingside
- Rook moves along the 8th rank can activate my rook

I'll activate my rook by moving it to a more central position where it can be more useful.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Looking at this position, I need to evaluate my options carefully. Let me check the legal moves.

I have an active rook and some passed pawns on the b-file. The white knight on d4 is a key piece to target.

I'll play a move that attacks the knight directly while keeping my rook active:

make_move f5d5

This move attacks the white knight on d4. If White captures my b3 pawn with Nxb3, I can swing my rook to b5 and eventually win the b2 pawn. If the knight retreats elsewhere (like Ne2), I can potentially capture the bishop with Rd2. If White plays Rxb4, I can take the knight with Rxd4 and come out ahead in material.

Looking at this position, I need to consider my options carefully.

The position shows:
- My King on g8 is somewhat restricted
- I have pawns on a7, g7, and b3 (the b3 pawn is blocked by white's b2 pawn)
- White has a Rook on d4, Bishop on d2, King on g3, and pawns on a6 and b2

Let me evaluate the King moves:
- Kf7 or Kf8 would allow Rd7+ or Rd8+ with check
- Kh7 gets the King off the back rank safely
- Kh8 goes to the corner (more passive)

I'll move my King to h7 to escape the back rank and potentially support my g-pawn's advance.

Looking at the position, I can see I have my king on h5, and pawns on a7, b3, and g3. White has their king on e5, a rook on a4, a bishop on e1, and pawns on a6 and b2.

The move g3g2 is very strong here - it pushes my pawn one square away from promotion, creating an immediate threat of queening on g1. White will have to respond to this, likely with Bf2 to cover the promotion square, but this ties down their bishop.

Looking at the board, I can see:
- My black king is on h5
- My black queen is on g1
- White king is on e5
- White has a rook on a4 and bishop on e7

Let me look for a strong move. I see I can give check with my queen, which is usually a good idea to seize the initiative.

make_move g1g5

This puts the white king in check, forcing it to move. From g5, my queen is very active and can continue to pressure the king while also potentially targeting the bishop on e7. This centralizing check maintains my initiative.

Looking at this position, I can see:
- White has a rook on a5, king on d6, and pawns on a6 and b2
- I have my king on e4 and pawns on a7 and b3

The critical issue is that White's a6 pawn is close to promoting, and my a7 pawn is blocking it but could be captured by the rook. I need to get my king active towards the queenside to fight for counterplay.

The most active move is to centralize and approach the queenside action. Moving to d4 gets my king closer to potentially attack the rook or help stop the a-pawn from promoting.

Looking at this position, I have my king on d4 with pawns on a7 and b3. White has a rook on c5, king on d6, and pawns on a6 and b2.

My b3 pawn is my best chance - it's attacking the white pawn on b2 and could potentially promote. I should move my king to support its advance while avoiding the rook's control of the c-file.

Looking at this position, I need to analyze my options carefully. I can see my king is on e3, I have pawns on a7 and b3, while White has their king on d6, a rook on b5, and pawns on a6 and b2.

My b3 pawn is blocked by the b2 pawn, and White's rook on b5 can easily capture it. Since I can't directly protect the b3 pawn with any of my legal moves, I should focus on centralizing my king for the best possible position.

- White has: King on c7, Rook on b5, Pawns on a6 and b2
- Black (me) has: King on e4, Pawns on a7 and b3

My b3 pawn is close to promotion but blocked by white's b2 pawn. I need to get my king to support capturing that b2 pawn.

Looking at my legal moves, **Kd4** seems best because:
1. It moves my king toward the queenside where the action is
2. If White plays Rb4+, I can respond with Kc3, defending my b3 pawn while also threatening to capture b2
3. It's the most active and centralizing move

Moving to c4 heads toward the b-file and prepares Kb3 to capture the blocking pawn.

My pawns are both blocked, so I need to use my king actively. Let me analyze my options:

- c4b4: Moves toward the queenside to support my b3 pawn
- c4d3: Moves toward the white b2 pawn

I'll move my king to b4 to get closer to supporting my b3 pawn and potentially threaten the b2 pawn, while staying safe from rook checks.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Looking at this position, I have a passed pawn on b3 that I need to advance. Let me analyze my options.

The key is to protect my pawn while advancing it toward promotion. If I play **Kc3**, my king protects the b3 pawn and sets up a winning sequence:

- If White plays Rxb3+, I respond Kxb3 and win the rook!
- If White plays Rb1 to stop promotion, I push b2, and if Rxb2, then Kxb2 wins the rook
- If White doesn't take, I can continue with Kc2 forcing the rook away and then promote

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Looking at this endgame position, I have a passed b-pawn on b3 that's well-supported by my king on c3. The most direct winning plan is to push this pawn toward promotion.

Let me analyze: if I push b3b2, the pawn threatens to queen on b1. White's rook on f4 would have to react (likely Rf1 to block), but then my king can support the pawn's promotion with moves like Kc2.

- My black pawn on a7

I have a significant material advantage (queen vs rook). Let me check the legal moves to find the best continuation.

Looking at my options, I can give check with Qb7+ which attacks the white king and sets up winning the a6 pawn. After the king moves, I can capture the pawn on a6 (often with check).

Looking at this endgame position:
- My black king is on b2
- I have a black pawn on a7
- White has a king on d5, rook on f4, and pawn on a6 blocking my pawn

I need to get my king toward the a-file to challenge the pawn structure. Moving toward the queenside makes sense.

Looking at this endgame position, I have my king on a3 and a pawn on a7, while White has a king on d5, rook on f7, and pawn on a6 blocking my pawn.

My pawn on a7 is in danger from the rook, and it's blocked by White's a6 pawn. I need to activate my king to help defend and potentially attack the a6 pawn.

The best move is to bring my king up to a4, which moves toward both pawns and prepares to potentially go to b5.

Looking at this position, I can see:
- My Black King is on b5, my pawn on a7
- White has King on e5, Rook on f7, and a pawn on a6 blocking my pawn

The critical move here is to capture the White pawn on a6. If I don't, my pawn remains permanently blocked and I have no winning chances. By taking on a6, I eliminate the blockade and create the threat of pushing my a-pawn.

Looking at this position, I have a passed pawn on a4 that I need to try to promote. My king on b6 needs to support the pawn's advance while avoiding checks from White's rook on d1.

The key is to keep my king close to the pawn to provide shelter and support. Moving to b5 keeps my king actively defending the pawn and prepares to potentially escort it down the board.

My best strategy is to advance my passed pawn toward promotion while using my king to support it. The pawn is already fairly advanced, and my king is well-positioned to escort it.

I need to bring my King closer to escort the pawn. Moving to b4 defends the pawn and prepares Kb3, getting in front of the pawn to shield it from the Rook.

The position shows:

- My Black pawn on a3
- White King on e3
- White Rook on g1

The most forcing move is to push my pawn to the second rank, threatening promotion. This puts immediate pressure on White.

Looking at the position, I have my Black King on b4 and Black Queen on a1, against White's King on d2 and Rook on g3. This is a winning endgame for me with the Queen vs Rook advantage.

Let me find the most forcing move. I see that Qd4+ gives check and attacks along the d-file. After this move:
- If Ke2 or Ke1, I simply capture the rook with Qxg3
- If Ke3, I play Qxg3+ winning the rook with check
- If Kc2, I can play Qf2+ followed by Qxg3
- If the rook interposes with Rd3, I capture it with Qxd3+

I'll play:

make_move d4e3

This is Qe3+, a forcing check. If White plays Kd1, I have Qd2# checkmate. If White plays Kf1, I continue with Qf2+ followed by winning the rook after Kg1 Qxg3+.

Looking at this position, I have a King vs King + Rook endgame, which is theoretically losing for me. My best strategy is to keep my King as central as possible and avoid being pushed to the edge of the board.

The rook on b3 controls the 3rd rank and b-file. Moving to e5 keeps my king central and away from the rook's immediate threats.

White has played 1. a4 (the Ware Opening), which is an unusual choice that doesn't fight for the center. I should take advantage by claiming central space.

I'll play a strong central move:

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Looking at this position, White has played an unusual opening with a4 and b3. I have a solid central pawn on d5. 

The most natural and principled move here is to develop my knight to f6, which:
- Develops a piece toward the center
- Controls the important e4 and d5 squares
- Prepares for kingside castling

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Looking at this position, White has played an unusual setup with a4, b3, and f3. I have a solid position with my knight on f6 and pawn on d5.

Given White's passive play, I should take advantage by expanding in the center. The move e7e5 creates a strong pawn center (d5-e5) and opens the diagonal for my dark-squared bishop.

Looking at this position, I have a solid setup with pawns on d5 and e5, both knights developed, and my king castled. My light-squared bishop on c8 still needs development.

I'll develop the bishop to an active square:

This develops my last minor piece to an active diagonal, where it has good scope and can support potential central play with e5-e4 later.

Looking at this position, I have a strong setup with central pawns and active pieces. White's king is still on e1 and hasn't castled yet.

I notice that Nd4 would be a very strong centralizing move. The knight on d4 would:
- Attack the b3 pawn and potentially fork the rook on a2
- Threaten Nxf3+ with check
- Occupy a dominant central square

1. Gives check to the white king on e2
2. Places my knight on a dominant central square
3. Maintains all my active pieces while forcing white to react

The white king on f2 appears somewhat exposed. I notice I can create threats by advancing my central pawn.

I'll play:

make_move e5e4

This move challenges white's f3 pawn and opens up the position. If white captures with fxe4, I can recapture with Nxe4+, giving check and placing my knight on a powerful central square. If white doesn't capture, I threaten exf3, creating a dangerous passed pawn near the white king.

- I have bishops actively placed on e7 and f5
- My pawn on e4 could capture on f3

The move Ng4+ (f6g4) looks very strong - it's a check and the knight will also attack e3, creating multiple threats.

Looking at this position, I can see some tactical opportunities with my bishops.

Let me analyze the key candidate moves:
- **Bxg4** (f5g4) - captures a pawn and attacks the queen on d1
- **Bxg3** (h4g3) - captures a pawn with check, but the king can simply recapture

After **Bxg4**, the bishop attacks the white queen along the diagonal. The queen has limited safe squares since e2 and f3 are both covered by the bishop on g4. White will have to retreat the queen to a passive square like c2 or c1, and I'll be up a clean pawn with active pieces.

get_legal_moves

The position shows an interesting setup with my bishop on h1 and the white king exposed on f2. Let me analyze the key options:

Looking at the queen moves, I notice **Qf6** would give check along the f-file to the king on f2. This forces White to respond:

1. If **Nf5** blocks - I capture **Qxf5** winning a knight
2. If **Ke1** or **Ke2** - I continue with **Qf2+** and win the bishop on f1
3. If **Kg1** - White survives but my queen remains very active

This is a forcing move that wins material in most variations!

Looking at this position, I have a bishop on h1 that can become very active. Let me analyze:

Looking at the board, I can see I'm playing Black with my king on g8, rooks on a8 and f8, a bishop on g4, and pawns on a7, b7, c7, d5, e4, f6, f7, and h7.

I have a strong passed e4 pawn and an active bishop on g4. Let me check the legal moves to find the best continuation.

get_legal_moves

I see several interesting options. The move **d5d4** stands out as it attacks the knight on c3 and the pawn on e3, creating tactical complications. After d4, if White plays exd4, I have e3+ which forks the king and creates threats. If the king goes to f3 to block, I have Bh5+ with check, and if the king goes elsewhere, my e-pawn becomes very dangerous.

- g4e2 attacks the queen but doesn't win material directly
- d4e3 only captures a pawn

Capturing the knight is clearly the best choice here.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Looking at the position, I have an interesting opportunity with my bishop on g4. Let me analyze the forcing moves available.

The move Bf3+ gives check and forces White's king to respond. After Bf3+:
- If Kh1, that's actually illegal because my bishop on f3 controls h1
- If Kh3, I have Bxf1+ (still check!) winning White's bishop
- If Kg1 or Kf2, I can take the bishop on f1 with Bxf1

This is a forcing sequence that at minimum trades bishops, and at best wins material if White errs with Kh3.

Looking at this position, I have a strong bishop on f3 that's putting pressure on White's position. The White knight on h4 looks somewhat awkwardly placed.

Let me attack it and continue my pressure:

make_move f3g4

This move attacks the knight on h4, forcing it to move. The bishop remains active on g4 and continues to apply pressure on White's position. If the knight retreats, I maintain my positional advantage.

Looking at this position, I can see several interesting options. Let me evaluate:

- I have an active bishop on g4
- My e4 pawn is passed and advanced
- White's bishop on c4 is targeting f7
- White's knight on h4 is somewhat awkwardly placed

The move **b7b5** looks very strong here - it directly attacks the white bishop on c4, gains queenside space, and forces White to make a decision about the bishop. This is a tempo-gaining move that improves my position.

- White's king on g1 is somewhat exposed with the knight on g2

The move that stands out to me is **c4c3** - this pawn push attacks White's queen on b2 and creates a dangerous passed pawn deep in White's territory. This forces White to react and gives me the initiative.

- Moving the bishop to f3 would attack the knight on g2, but it allows Qxf6 which could lead to dangerous tactics
- Playing f6f5 removes my pawn from the queen's diagonal and prepares Bf3 safely

Looking at this position, I see White has an active knight on f4 and a well-placed queen on g2. My king is tucked away on h8 but I need to activate my rooks.

I'll centralize my rook to the e-file, which puts pressure on the e3 pawn and prepares to potentially double rooks.

Looking at the position, I can see my king is on h8 with rooks on a8 and e8. White has a queen on g2, rook on a3, and knight on f4. I need to be careful about potential back-rank threats and the active knight.

Let me consider the position carefully. The white queen on g2 could potentially threaten Qg8+ ideas. I should also watch out for Ng6+ forks from the knight.

I'll play a solid move that defends the back rank and consolidates my position:

After Rf2+, White must deal with the check, and regardless of how the king moves, I'll capture the queen on d2.

Looking at this position, I'm down material (Queen vs Rook) and need to be careful. The White Queen on f4 is quite active and could threaten my king.

Let me analyze the key considerations:
- White's Queen on f4 could potentially threaten Qf8+ or Qxf7
- My king on h8 is somewhat exposed
- I need to create some counterplay

The move **f7f5** attacks the White Queen directly, forcing it to move, and also advances my pawn which could become useful. This gains a tempo and improves my position slightly.

The White Queen on f4 could potentially create threats with Qf8+. My King on h8 is somewhat vulnerable on the back rank.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Looking at the board, I can see this is a challenging position for Black. I'm down significant material (White has a Queen and Rook vs my Rook), so I need to be careful about tactics.

Let me get the legal moves to see my options:

get_legal_moves

The key threat I need to address is Qf7+ which could lead to dangerous attacks on my king. Let me consider Rf8 - this move:
1. Defends the f7 square (if Qf7+, I can play Rxf7 winning the Queen!)
2. Activates my rook on a useful file
3. Provides defensive coverage on the back rank

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Now I'll make my move. Looking at the position, I need to defend against the threat of Qf7+ which would be very dangerous for my king. By moving my rook to f8, I defend the f7 square and if White plays Qf7+, I can simply capture the Queen with Rxf7.

Looking at this position, I have a rook on f8 and my king on g7. White has an active queen on f4 and a rook on c2.

I should activate my rook and protect my f5 pawn. Moving the rook to f6 defends the pawn and gives my rook more activity along the 6th rank.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Looking at this position, I can see my rook on f6 is pinned by the white queen on e5 (protecting my king on g7). I need to find an active move.

Let me analyze the key options:

1. **f5f4** - This attacks the white king on g3 directly! If the king takes (Kxf4), my position is still difficult but if white declines, I can push f3 creating a dangerous passed pawn. Also importantly, if white mistakenly plays Qxf4??, my rook can capture the queen since it would no longer be pinned!

2. **Kh6** - Unpins my rook but doesn't create immediate threats.

Given I'm down significant material (facing Queen + Rook vs my Rook), I need to create counterplay against the exposed white king.

Looking at this position, I'm in serious trouble with the white rook on f6 and queen on e5 attacking my king. Let me analyze my two options:

- **Kg8**: Walks into a corner where White has Qe6+ leading to quick mate (after ...Kh8, Qf7 threatens unstoppable Qg8#)

- **Kg7**: The queen's diagonal to g7 is blocked by White's own rook on f6, so this is legal. While still difficult, moving toward h6 gives my king more escape squares and potential for counterplay.

White has played the Réti Opening (1. Nf3). This is a flexible opening that can transpose into many systems.

I'll respond with a classical central move, staking my claim in the center.

Looking at this position, I have a solid d5 pawn in the center. The most natural continuation is to develop my knight to f6, which controls the center, develops a piece, and prepares castling.

Looking at this position, I see we're in an opening where I've already developed my knight to f6 and pushed d5. White has played a3 and Nf3.

A strong developing move here would be to activate my light-squared bishop. I'll pin the knight on f3 to the queen.

Looking at this position, I see White has an active knight on e5. My bishop on g4 is well-placed, and I have a knight on f6. I should continue developing and challenge that central knight.

The move Nbd7 (b8d7) looks strong here - it develops my knight, attacks White's powerful e5 knight, and prepares to castle kingside.

Looking at the position, I have active pieces with knights on d7 and f6, and a well-placed bishop on g4. 

I'll play a strong centralizing move, bringing my knight to a powerful outpost in the center:

make_move f6e4

This places my knight on the dominant e4 square where it controls key central squares and cannot easily be challenged. It's a typical move in these positions to increase piece activity and pressure.

Looking at this position, I have a very active knight on e4 and a bishop on g4 that's putting pressure on the e2-d1 diagonal.

Let me analyze the tactical opportunities here. I notice my knight on e4 can jump to f2, which would fork the white queen on d1 and the rook on h1. After this move:
- If White plays Kxf2, I play Bxd1 winning the queen
- If White moves the queen, I take the rook with Nxh1
- If White plays Kf1, I win the queen with Nxd1

This is a decisive tactical blow!

Looking at this position, I have a well-placed bishop on g4 and White's king is exposed on f2. I should increase the pressure on White's position.

The move Bf3 attacks the g2 pawn and creates threats against White's king. If White captures with gxf3, the g-file opens up dangerously. If White plays g3 to defend, my bishop remains very active.

Looking at this position, I have an active bishop on f3 and the white king is somewhat exposed on f2. Let me analyze my options.

My bishop on f3 is already well-placed. I should look to improve my knight and increase pressure. The move Ne5 stands out as it places my knight on a powerful central square where it can potentially jump to g4 (creating threats near the king) or d3.

Looking at this position, I have my knight on e5 in an active spot. Let me analyze the key features:

- White's king is exposed on f2
- There's a white pawn on f3 that my knight can capture
- White has a rook on g1

I see a strong tactical opportunity here. By playing Nxf3+, I can:
1. Capture the pawn on f3
2. Give check to the king on f2
3. Attack the rook on g1 simultaneously

This is a winning fork!

Looking at this position, I notice White's king is on f2 and there's a pawn on d2. The move d8d2 would capture the pawn and deliver check to the king!

Let me analyze this:
- After Qxd2+, White's king must move
- Black wins a pawn and has an active, centrally placed queen

This looks like the best option.

Looking at this position, I can see my king is still on e8 and my bishop on f8 is blocking kingside castling. I need to develop and get my king to safety.

I can see a strong tactical opportunity with my bishop. The white king on e1 is somewhat exposed, and I have active pieces that can create threats.

The move Bf2+ looks very promising! It gives check and creates several threats:
- If white plays Kd1, I can follow with Rg1 threatening the f1 bishop, and if Qe1 to block, then Rxe1+ wins the queen for a rook
- If white plays Qxf2, then Rd1+ forces the king to e2, and Rxf1 wins the bishop with an active rook position

Let me analyze the position. I can see:
- Black king on c8, rooks on d8 and g7
- White has an exposed king on f2, queen on e2, bishops on d2 and f1

Let me check my available moves.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Looking at this position, I can see White's king is somewhat exposed on f2 and there's a bishop on d2 that appears to be hanging.

Let me look at the key features:
- My rook on d8 can capture the bishop on d2
- My rook on g7 has some interesting possibilities including Rg2+

The move Rxd2 wins a piece cleanly - the bishop on d2 is only protected by the queen, and after Qxd2 I'll be up material.

Looking at the position, I can see my rook on g7 has good mobility along the g-file. The white King on f2 looks exposed, and there's a pawn on f3 that could be a target.

Let me play an aggressive move with my rook:

make_move g7g3

This move attacks the f3 pawn and threatens Rxf3+ with check, putting pressure on White's exposed King position.

Looking at this position, I have an active rook on g3 near the white king on f2. Let me analyze the key moves.

I notice that Rg2+ would be check since the king is on f2. The queen on e3 cannot capture on g2, making this a strong move that forces the king to move.

After Rg2+:
- If Ke1, then Rg1+ wins the bishop on f1
- If Kf1, then Rxh2 wins a pawn with an active rook on the 2nd rank

- If Kf1, then Rxd2 wins the knight

This wins material cleanly.

- My king on c8 is relatively safe for now
- I have an advanced pawn on c4
- If I play b5-b4, I attack the c3 pawn, and if cxb4, my c4 pawn can advance to c3, creating serious threats

This seems like a strong aggressive continuation.

Looking at this position, I'm significantly down in material (White has Queen, Rook, Bishop, and Knight while I only have pawns). My best chance is to push my advanced queenside pawns.

The b4 pawn is well-placed to create threats. Pushing it to b3 will attack the b2 pawn and create a dangerous passed pawn that could become a serious problem for White.

Looking at this position, I'm down significant material with only pawns against White's Queen, Rook, Bishop, and Knight. My King on c8 is somewhat exposed, and I need to activate it while being careful of tactical threats.

Let me analyze the key features:
- I have an advanced pawn on b3 (though blocked by White's b2 pawn)
- My c4 pawn is also advanced
- White's Knight on e4 is very active
- White's Queen on e2 and Rook on d1 can create threats

I'll centralize my King to connect better with my pawns and prepare for the endgame.

Looking at this position, my king on b7 is somewhat exposed with White's queen on e2 and rook on c1 potentially creating threats. I need to prioritize king safety.

The best move here is to tuck my king away to a safer square.

Looking at this position, I have a black pawn on c4 that's quite advanced, and White has an active knight on e4. Let me look for an active move.

I'll play **e6e5** - this attacks the white pawn on f4 and challenges White's central control. It also helps activate my position.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Looking at the board, I can see a great tactical opportunity. My pawn on f5 can capture the white knight on e4!

This is a strong move because:
- I win White's knight (worth ~3 points)
- Even if White recaptures with the rook or queen, I've traded a pawn for a knight
- I also have a dangerous passed pawn on b3

Looking at this position, I have a very advanced pawn on f3. The most aggressive move here is to push it further.

make_move f3f2

This move puts tremendous pressure on White. The pawn on f2 now directly threatens the bishop on f1 and is one step away from promotion. White's king on e1 is also restricted by this pawn. This creates serious tactical problems for White to solve.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Looking at this position, White has played 1.d4 d5 2.g3, indicating a Catalan-style setup with plans to fianchetto the bishop.

The most natural and principled response is to develop my knight to f6, which:
- Develops a piece to its most active square
- Controls central squares e4 and d5
- Prepares kingside castling
- Keeps flexibility in the pawn structure

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Looking at this position, I can see we're in a Queen's Pawn Game with pawns on d4 and d5. White has played g3, likely preparing to fianchetto their bishop (Catalan-style setup).

A strong move here is to develop my light-squared bishop actively before potentially playing ...e6, which would lock it in.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Looking at this position, I have a nice setup with my knight on f6 and bishop actively placed on f5. White has played a London-style setup with d4, Nd2, and has pushed pawns on the kingside (h4, g3).

The most natural continuation is to develop my queenside knight to a good square where it pressures the center.

Looking at this position, I have a solid setup with knights developed on c6 and f6, and a bishop actively placed on f5. My priority should be to complete development and ensure king safety.

The move **e7e6** is a solid choice here - it reinforces my d5 pawn, opens up the f8 bishop's diagonal so I can develop it and prepare to castle kingside.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Looking at this position, I can see it's a Queen's Gambit Declined structure. White has a bishop on g5 putting pressure on my f6 knight, and I have an active bishop on f5.

A very standard and strong move here is to challenge White's bishop with h6, asking it what it wants to do. With White's h-pawn already on h4, the bishop's retreat options are limited.

Looking at this position, I have a strong knight on e4 and an active bishop on f5. Let me analyze the key options.

I notice that my dark-squared bishop on f8 can give check on b4. This is a powerful developing move with tempo that could lead to winning material.

After Bb4+, White must respond to the check:
- If Nc3, I can play Nxc3, and after bxc3, Bxc3+ forks the king and rook on a1
- If Bd2, I exchange and maintain a strong position
- If c3, my bishop retreats but I keep the initiative

I notice my knight on e4 can deliver a powerful fork!

This move puts the white king in check and simultaneously attacks the rook on h1. After the king moves, I'll capture the rook, winning the exchange.

Looking at this position, I can see my knight on d3 is very actively placed near White's exposed king on e2.

Let me analyze the position:
- White's king is vulnerable on e2
- I have a knight on d3 deep in enemy territory
- My bishop on b4 controls the d2 square

I notice that d3f4 gives check! The knight on f4 would attack the king on e2, and this move maintains strong pressure. After Nf4+:
- If Kd2, it's blocked by my bishop on b4
- If Kf2, I can follow with Qd4+ winning material
- If Kf3, I play Qd5+ and win the queen
- If Ke1, I continue with Nd3+ keeping the attack going

This is a strong attacking move that keeps the initiative.

Looking at this position, I can see an interesting setup. Let me analyze the legal moves to find the best option.

The white king is exposed on e2, and I notice I have a tactical opportunity. My knight on c6 can capture the d4 pawn, winning material. After Nxd4, white must recapture, likely with Qxd4, and I'll be up a pawn with a strong position.

Looking at this position, I can see I have two active bishops and my king is still in the center. The white rook on h4 looks aimed at the kingside. Let me consider my options.

I notice I have both castling options available. Given the rook on h4 pointing at the kingside, queenside castling seems more prudent. It will:
1. Get my king to safety on the opposite side from White's attacking rook
2. Activate my a8 rook to the d-file
3. Keep my strong bishops active

Looking at this position, I notice my bishop on f5 has a powerful diagonal. Let me analyze the key opportunities.

I can see the White knight on b1 is undefended, and my bishop on f5 has a clear diagonal path to capture it (f5-e4-d3-c2-b1).

This wins a piece outright!

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Looking at this position, I can see I'm playing Black with my king on c8 and two rooks on d8 and h8. My bishop on a2 is nicely placed on the long diagonal.

I notice an interesting tactical possibility. Let me play:

make_move d5d4

This move attacks White's e3 pawn and creates dynamic play. If White captures with exd4, I can follow up with e5, attacking the bishop on f4 and gaining central space. If White advances e4 instead, my d4 pawn becomes a strong passed pawn. This creates active counterplay.

Let me evaluate the key options:

- **a2d5** - centralizes my bishop attacking e4
- **d8d5** - activates the rook attacking c5

The most dynamic move is to push my passed pawn forward. This creates immediate pressure and threatens to advance further with d3-d2+.

- If White plays Bxd2 (from f4), I capture Rxd2, winning a bishop for a pawn
- If White tries Rd1 to block, I play dxd1=Q+ and promote with check!

This is a decisive move that wins material in all variations.

- I have a passed pawn on d2 (though currently blocked by White's queen on d1)
- My bishop on a2 is somewhat passive
- White has a strong knight on e5 and active pieces

Let me look for tactical opportunities...

I notice the c5 pawn appears to be undefended! If I play my rook to d5, I can attack it directly.

Let me verify: The knight on e5 can't capture on d5, the bishops don't cover that square, and the c5 pawn has no defenders.

This move attacks the undefended c5 pawn while also centralizing my rook actively.

Looking at this position, I have a very dangerous passed pawn on d2 that's only one square from promotion. The White queen on d1 is blocking it, but I can exploit this.

Let me analyze the critical move:

If I play **Rd3**, I'm attacking the queen. White is in a dilemma:
- If Qxd3, then d1=Q and I promote, gaining a queen while White only won my rook
- If the Queen moves elsewhere, I can still promote with d1=Q

This creates a decisive tactical threat.

Looking at the position, I see I have a very dangerous passed pawn on d2 that's only one square away from promotion. The white Queen on d1 is blocking my pawn's promotion.

I notice that I can play my rook to g1, which attacks the Queen directly. If the Queen moves, my pawn promotes. If the Queen captures the rook, my pawn still promotes to a Queen.

Looking at this position, I notice I have a very advanced passed pawn on d2, just one square from promotion! The white queen on d1 is blocking it.

Let me play a forcing move that attacks the queen and creates immediate threats around my passed pawn.

make_move h8d8

This move attacks the white queen on d1. If the queen moves anywhere except capturing my d2 pawn, I can promote with d1=Q! White is essentially forced to capture on d2, but this is still my best practical chance to create counterplay.

Looking at this position, I can see my rook on d8 has several active options. Let me analyze the key features:

- White has a knight on e5 and a pawn on c5
- My king is on c8 and relatively safe for now
- I have a passed pawn on d2 (though it appears blocked)
- White's pieces are actively placed

The move Rd5 looks strong because it:
1. Attacks the knight on e5
2. Attacks the pawn on c5
3. Centralizes my rook powerfully

If the knight moves, I capture the c5 pawn. If it stays, I capture the knight.

Looking at this position, I see my rook on d5 is being attacked by the white knight on e5. I notice I have a passed pawn on d2 which is blocking the d-file, preventing the white queen from reaching d8.

Looking at the board, I can see I'm playing as Black with my king on c8, a rook on c5, and several pawns. I notice there's a black pawn on d2 which is very advanced!

Let me analyze the legal moves. I see an interesting tactical idea with **c5c1** - putting my rook on the first rank to attack the White queen on d1. 

If White captures with **Qxc1**, then my pawn on d2 can capture the queen with **dxc1=Q**, winning White's queen for just my rook - a massive material gain!

If White declines to capture, I maintain pressure on the first rank and can look for further tactical opportunities.

Looking at this position, I have a very powerful passed pawn on d2 that's being watched by White's rook on c2. My king on d7 should be activated to support this pawn's advance.

The most logical plan is to bring my king closer to support the d2 pawn's promotion. Moving the king to d6 centralizes it and prepares to march down to help the pawn.

Looking at this position, I can see I have a passed pawn on d2 which is a significant advantage. Let me analyze the position:

- My king is on d6
- I have pawns on a7, b7, c7, e5, f7, g7, h6, and importantly d2 (passed pawn!)
- White has rooks on c2 and e3, bishops on d1 and g3, and pawns on b4 and e4

The best strategy is to create more threats and pressure. I'll play f7-f5 to attack the e4 pawn and potentially create more passed pawns. If White takes with exf5, my e5 pawn can advance to e4, creating dangerous connected passed pawns.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Looking at this position, I have a passed pawn on d2 that's blocked by the bishop on d1, and my king is somewhat exposed on d6.

Let me evaluate my options:
- King moves to safety (e7 or d7) would likely result in losing the d2 pawn to Rxd2
- d6d5 keeps my king centralized and active, which is important in this endgame

An active king is crucial in this type of position. Moving to d5 maintains central control and keeps my king supporting my pawns.

White has played a3, a rather passive opening move. I should take advantage by claiming central space immediately.

This is a strong classical response, occupying the center and opening lines for my queen and light-squared bishop. Against such a passive move from White, taking control of the center is the best strategy.

Looking at this position, I see White has played a Bird's Opening setup with f4 and Nc3. I've developed my knight to f6 and pushed d5.

A strong move here is to develop my light-squared bishop actively before committing to e6 (which would block it in). Placing the bishop on f5 gives it a nice active diagonal.

Looking at this position, I have a solid setup with my knight on f6 and bishop actively placed on f5. I need to continue development and prepare to castle.

The move e6 will support my d5 pawn, open a diagonal for my dark-squared bishop on f8, and allow me to castle kingside soon.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Looking at the position, I see a fairly standard setup. Black has developed the bishop to f5 and knight to f6, with a solid pawn structure on d5 and e6. White has an unusual knight placement on f2.

I should continue developing my pieces. The bishop on f8 needs to come out, and Bd6 looks like an active square - it develops the piece, eyes the kingside, and prepares potential castling.

1. Secure my king
2. Connect my rooks
3. Activate the h8 rook

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Looking at this position, I can see White's king is still stuck in the center which is a significant weakness. I have a strong pawn on e4 and active bishops.

Let me analyze the tactical possibilities with my e4 pawn. If I push it to e3, it attacks the knight on f2, and White will face serious problems:

- If Nfxe3, then Ng4 attacks the knight and threatens Bxc2 winning the queen
- If the knight retreats (Nd1, Nh3), then e2! becomes a dangerous passed pawn

This looks very strong. I'll play:

Looking at this position, I can see I have a solid setup with my king castled and pieces reasonably developed. The knight on f6 can be improved, and I notice an opportunity to place it actively in the center.

Let me play a strong central move that puts pressure on White's position:

make_move f6e4

This places my knight on the powerful e4 square, where it attacks the knight on c3 and controls key central squares. It's an active move that increases my presence in the center.

Looking at this position, I can see White's king is still in the center (uncastled), which presents tactical opportunities.

Let me analyze the key features:
- My knight on e4 is actively placed
- My bishop on d6 has good scope
- White's king on e1 is vulnerable

I notice that **Qh4** creates immediate threats:
- Threatens Qxg3, winning a pawn and attacking the h1 rook
- Sets up potential Qf2+ tactics if White pushes g4

If White defends with g4, then Qf2+ becomes a strong check with the king exposed.

Looking at this position, I have a very strong tactical opportunity. My knight on e4 can jump to f2, creating a devastating fork.

This move Nf2 creates a royal fork, attacking White's King on e1, Queen on d1, and Rook on h1 simultaneously. White must respond to the check, and I'll win significant material.

Looking at this position, I need to develop my pieces. My knight on b8 is still on its starting square and needs to be activated. 

The position shows White has an exposed king on f2 and knights on c3 and f4. I have a strong pawn on d5 controlling the center.

The most natural developing move is to bring my knight into play. Nc6 is a good square - it develops the knight to a central position, supports my d5 pawn, and prepares potential coordination with my rooks.

Looking at this position, I have my knight actively placed on d4, and I need to find the best continuation.

Analyzing the position:
- My knight on d4 is well-placed
- White has knights on c3 and f4, with the queen on e4
- The white king on f2 is somewhat exposed

Let me consider **Ne6** - this move attacks the white knight on f4 and creates tactical threats. If White plays Nxe6, I recapture with fxe6, opening the f-file for my rook on f8 against the exposed White king. If White tries Qxe6??, then fxe6 wins the queen!

Looking at this position, I can see White has a powerful Queen on e7. I'm playing Black and need to find a good response.

Let me analyze my knight moves from h3. If I play **Ng5+**, it gives check to the King on f3. White's options would be:
- If King moves (Kf4, Ke4, etc.), I can follow up with **Ne6+** forking the King and Queen!
- White's only way to avoid losing the Queen is to capture with **hxg5**

This is a strong tactical try to win material back.

Looking at this position, I can see White's Queen on e7 is very aggressively placed, threatening my pawns and potentially dangerous checks.

Let me analyze my options. I notice my knight on g5 can jump to h3, which would threaten Nf2+ forking the White King on e3 and the Rook on h1.

If White tries to capture material with Qxf8+, I can play Kxf8 and I've traded my rook for their Queen - a significant material gain!

If White plays Qe8+ trying to check first, I simply capture with Rxe8, winning the Queen outright.

This looks like a strong tactical shot.

Looking at this position, I can see the White queen on e7 is threatening my f8 rook. However, I notice my knight on h3 has a powerful tactic available!

The move **Nf2+** is a knight fork - it gives check to the White king on e3 while simultaneously attacking the rook on h1. White must deal with the check, and then I'll capture the rook.

Looking at this position, I can see the White Queen on e7 is creating serious threats against my position, particularly eyeing f7. Let me check my legal moves to find the best response.

I notice a critical tactical opportunity. The White Queen on e7 is currently unprotected! If I play my rook to e8, I attack the Queen. Let me analyze:

- If Qxe8+, I can recapture with Rxe8 from a8 - winning the Queen for a Rook!
- If Qxf7+ Kh8, then Qf8+ Rxf8 - again winning the Queen!

Either way, I win significant material.

Looking at this position, I can see my knight on d3 is actively placed in White's territory. I'm behind in material, so I need to play actively.

Let me analyze the key options:
- **Nxb4** or **Nxc1** would trade pieces, but I'm already behind in material
- **Nf2+** gives check and forces the White king to move, keeping my knight active

The move Nf2+ is particularly appealing because:
1. It's a check, forcing White to respond
2. After the likely Ke2, I can capture the h3 pawn with Nxh3
3. It keeps my only knight active and creating threats

Looking at this position, I have a very active knight on f2. Let me analyze the best continuation.

I see a strong tactical opportunity. My knight on f2 can jump to d3, which creates a fork attacking multiple pieces:
- The white knight on b4
- The white bishop on c1
- The white pawn on b2

This is a winning tactic that should net me material.

Looking at this position, I have a rook on a8 and my king on g8. White has an exposed king on f3 and pawns on the kingside.

I should create some counterplay. The move b7b5 looks promising as it attacks White's c4 pawn and creates queenside activity. This could lead to opening lines for my rook.

Looking at this position, White has played 1. d4. I'll respond with a classical and solid move that fights for the center.

This is the Queen's Pawn Game, and by playing d5 I'm staking my own claim in the center, leading to positions like the Queen's Gambit if White continues with c4. It's a principled and time-tested response.

Looking at this position, White has played d4 and the unusual Na3. I have a solid center with d5.

The most natural and strong response is to develop my knight to f6, controlling central squares and preparing for further development.

Looking at this position, I can see we're in a d4-d5 structure. White has played the unusual Na3 move. I have my knight developed to f6, and the d-pawn is on d5.

A good developing move here would be to get my light-squared bishop out before potentially playing e6 (which would lock it in). The move Bf5 develops the bishop to an active diagonal.

Looking at this position, I have a nice setup with my bishop actively placed on f5 and knight developed to f6. White's knight on a3 is somewhat awkwardly placed.

I should continue my development and prepare to castle. The move e7e6 is solid - it supports my d5 pawn, opens the diagonal for my dark-squared bishop on f8, and prepares kingside castling.

White's setup is a bit unusual with the knight on a3 and queen on d2. I should continue development and prepare to castle.

The move Bd6 looks strong - it develops my dark-squared bishop to an active diagonal aiming at the kingside, and prepares castling. It also keeps future tactical possibilities against h2.

Looking at this position, I notice something very interesting. The white knight on a3 appears to be undefended, and my bishop on d6 can capture it.

The bishop on d6 has a clear diagonal to a3. This would win a knight for nothing!

Looking at this position, I have some strong pieces infiltrated into White's position. My knight on d2 is particularly well placed, and the White king on f2 looks exposed.

Let me check for tactical opportunities. I notice I can play a strong move with my knight:

make_move d2f3

This move puts the White king in check! The knight on f3 attacks the king on f2, and this forces White to react immediately. After the king moves, I'll have strong follow-up threats with my queen potentially coming to h4 with further attacks on the exposed king.

Looking at this position, I have well-placed bishops on a3 and f5, but my king is still in the center and needs to be secured. I notice I can castle kingside, which will:

1. Get my king to safety
2. Connect my rooks
3. Prepare to use the h-file for potential attacks

Looking at this position, I notice the white bishop on a3 is attacking my rook on f8 along the diagonal. I need to address this threat while also taking advantage of White's exposed king on e3.

The move Qd6 looks strong here - it blocks the bishop's attack on my rook while centralizing my queen on an active square. From d6, my queen exerts pressure on the center and keeps future tactical possibilities open.

- The White king on e3 is in the center and vulnerable
- I have pressure along various lines

The move **b1e4** looks very strong - it centralizes my bishop powerfully, attacks the f3 pawn, and restricts the White king's movement. The bishop on e4 will be a dominant piece.

Looking at this position, I have an interesting bishop on e4. Let me analyze the options.

I notice that if I play my bishop to b1, it will attack the undefended a2 pawn. White's best defense would be Nc3, but then after Bxa2, Nxa2, I've won a pawn (trading my bishop for knight + pawn).

This seems like a good practical choice to gain material advantage.

Looking at this position, I can see my bishop on a2 and some interesting tactical opportunities. The white king is exposed on d2, and I notice the white knight on e2 and bishop on f1 are on the same diagonal.

Let me play a move that creates a strong threat:

make_move a2c4

This moves my bishop to c4, where it forks the white knight on e2 and the white bishop on f1! White cannot save both pieces since the knight blocks the bishop from capturing on c4.

Looking at this position, I can see my bishop on c4 is actively placed and there's a white knight on e2 that I can capture. Let me evaluate the key options:

The knight on e2 is a target. If I capture it with my bishop (c4e2), White will likely recapture with either the king (exposing it further) or the bishop on f1. Either way, I eliminate an important defensive piece.

I'll capture the knight:

Looking at this position, I have a material advantage with two rooks and a knight against White's rook and two bishops. I should focus on developing my pieces and coordinating my forces.

The knight on b8 is undeveloped, and moving it to c6 would:
- Develop the knight to an active square
- Put pressure on White's d4 pawn
- Control important central squares (e5, d4)

- White has the bishop pair and pawns on b5, d4, f3, f4, and h4
- My knight on c6 has several options
- White's king on e2 looks somewhat exposed

I notice that the d4 pawn might be vulnerable. Let me check - if my knight captures on d4, it would also give check to the king on e2! That's a great tactical opportunity to win a pawn with tempo.

Looking at this position, I have my knight actively placed on d4 with several options.

Let me analyze the key moves:
- d4f3 would capture the f3 pawn, but then Kxf3 would win my knight back - not a good trade
- d4b5 captures the b5 pawn, but the bishop on f1 controls that diagonal and could recapture
- d4f5 places my knight on an excellent central outpost

The knight on f5 would be very strong - it attacks the h4 pawn and is safely placed where White's pieces cannot easily capture it.

- The knight on f5 has several options
- Moves like f5g3 or f5e3 look tempting but would hang the knight to Kxg3 or Kxe3
- f5h4 captures a pawn but loses the knight to Rxh4

The move **f5d4** stands out:
- Places the knight on a dominant central square
- Attacks both the b5 and f3 pawns
- The knight is safe there - neither bishop can capture it (wrong diagonals/colors), and the king can't reach it

Looking at the position, I can see my knight on h4 has an excellent tactical opportunity.

The move h4f3 would deliver check to the white king on f2 while simultaneously attacking the rook on g4. This is a classic knight fork!

Looking at this position, I have a significant material advantage with my rooks and knight against White's two bishops. I also have a strong passed d-pawn on d4.

The knight on g4 is well-placed but can be improved. Let me consider my options:

- **g4e3** - Centralizes the knight on a dominant square, controlling key squares around White's king and supporting my passed d-pawn's advance
- **g4f2+** - Gives check but the king simply moves
- **d4d3** - Pushes the passed pawn, but the bishop on e2 could take it

I'll play the strong centralizing move that puts my knight on an ideal outpost:

- The f3 bishop currently controls the d1 promotion square
- I need to deal with that bishop to promote safely

The move **Ng2** (f4g2) is very strong here! It threatens Ne1, attacking the f3 bishop. If White takes on e1 (Bxe1), I can push d2 and then promote to d1=Q safely since the bishop no longer controls that square. If White doesn't take, I can capture on f3 with Nxf3, removing the defender of d1.

Looking at this position, I have a significant material advantage with two rooks and a knight against two bishops. I notice I have a dangerous passed pawn on d3 that can advance.

The move **d3d2** is very strong here - pushing the pawn to the 2nd rank creates an immediate promotion threat. The white king on c1 is in an awkward position, and neither bishop can easily stop this pawn from queening.

This move puts the rook on d2 with check. After the king moves (likely to b3, b1, c1, or c3), I can follow up with Nd4+ which would fork the king and bishop in many lines, winning White's bishop and simplifying to an easily winning endgame.

Looking at this position, I have a significant material advantage with two rooks and a knight against just a bishop and two pawns. Let me check my legal moves to find the strongest continuation.

get_legal_moves

I see several promising options. The position shows my rook on d2 and knight on e2 are both very active near the white king on b3. Let me play a forcing move.

make_move d2b2

This gives check to the white king and activates my rook along the second rank, further constricting the exposed white king.

Looking at this position, I have a well-placed knight on e2 and need to make the most of it. Let me analyze the key options.

I see that e2c3 delivers a check to the white king on b2, and also attacks the b5 pawn. This is a strong move that forces the king to move and applies immediate pressure.

2. Control the h-pawn from advancing
3. Eventually push my pawns

I'll activate my rook by placing it on the open e-file, which also puts pressure on White's bishop.

Looking at this position, I have a significant material advantage with a rook against White's bishop. The bishop on a7 is awkwardly placed. Let me analyze my options.

The bishop on a7 is potentially vulnerable. If I can attack it with my rook while cutting off its escape routes, I might win it.

I'll play **Ra8** to directly attack the bishop on a7. This forces the bishop to move, and if it goes to b8, I can capture it with Rxb8. If it escapes to b6, I still have an active rook on the a-file.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Looking at this endgame position, I have a rook against White's bishop with passed pawns on b5 and h5. The key principle in rook endgames is to activate the rook, ideally placing it behind passed pawns.

The move Ra1 gets my rook to an ideal position on the back rank, where it can:
1. Attack the b5 pawn from behind if needed (via b1)
2. Control the h1 square to stop the h-pawn's advance
3. Keep the White king restricted

Looking at this position, I have a significant material advantage with 6 pawns against White's lone bishop. The key is to advance my pawns and create a passed pawn that can promote.

Looking at this position, I have a powerful queen on e1 and the white king is exposed on h5. Let me analyze for a strong attacking move.

The white king on h5 is very vulnerable. If I can check along the 5th rank, I may be able to force checkmate quickly.

Looking at the position:
- My queen on e1 can reach e5, giving check along the 5th rank
- After Qe5+, if the king goes to h6 or g6, I have Qg5# checkmate!

Looking at this position, I have a queen on e5 versus White's bishop on c7 and king on h4. I have a significant material advantage.

Let me check for any tactical opportunities like checkmate threats first.

get_legal_moves

The White king on h4 is somewhat exposed, but I don't see an immediate forced checkmate. The simplest and most practical approach is to win White's bishop, leaving me with queen and pawns versus a bare king.

make_move e5c7

This captures the bishop on c7, giving me an easily winning position with queen and four pawns against a lone king.

Looking at this position, I have a massive advantage with my Queen and pawns against the lone White King on g4. Let me look for a quick checkmate.

get_legal_moves

The King on g4 is exposed. I notice that h7-h5 would give check since the pawn would attack g4 diagonally!

After 1...h5+:
- If 2.Kh3, then Qg3# is checkmate!
- If 2.Kg3, then Qg7+ Kh4 Qg4# is checkmate
- If 2.Kg5, then Qc5+ leads to a quick mate

Looking at this position, I have a dominant queen and pawns against a lone white king on h3. This should be a winning endgame - I need to construct a mating net.

Let me check my options:

get_legal_moves

The white king on h3 is already near the edge. I'll play a move that centralizes my queen and restricts the king's movement while setting up mating threats.

make_move c7f4

This move:
- Places my queen on an active central square
- Controls key squares g3 and h2 (cutting off king's escape)
- Threatens ideas like g5+ followed by mating patterns
- If the king goes to h4, I can play g5# (checkmate, as h5 is blocked by my pawn, h3 controlled by queen, and g4 controlled by queen)

Looking at this position, I'm in a winning endgame with 4 pawns against White's lone king. My h4 pawn is the most advanced.

The best approach is to push the h-pawn and create threats. If I play h3, White must respond with Kg3 or the pawn will queen. Then I can follow up with g5, creating connected passed pawns that will be unstoppable.

Looking at this position, I have a significant advantage with 4 pawns against the lone white king. The h3 pawn is very advanced and close to promotion.

The white king on g4 cannot stop the h-pawn from promoting if I push it now. After h3h2, the king cannot reach h1 in time to prevent promotion on my next move.

I'll start advancing my passed pawn.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Looking at this endgame position, I have my king on g8, pawns on f7, g7, and b5, while White only has the king on g5.

The key here is my passed b-pawn on b5. I need to create a situation where I can push it to promotion while White's king is too far away to stop it.

Let me play:

make_move f7f6

This move gives check, forcing White's king to move away. After the king retreats, I can start pushing my b-pawn. The White king won't be able to both stop my b-pawn and attack my kingside pawns effectively. My b-pawn only needs 4 moves to queen (b4-b3-b2-b1), and the White king will be too far to catch it.

Looking at this endgame position, I have a passed pawn on b5 while my kingside pawns on f6 and g7 are under pressure from the white king on f5.

The key here is that my b-pawn is far from the white king. If I push it, the white king cannot catch it in time, even if it captures my kingside pawns.

Let me calculate:
- If b4, and White takes on f6, then b3, and even if White takes on g7, my pawn races to promotion with b2-b1=Q before the White king can get back.

Looking at this position, I have a pawn on b2 that's one square away from promotion! This is clearly the winning move.

Promoting my pawn to a queen will give me a decisive material advantage in this endgame.

Looking at this position, I have a significant material advantage with my Queen against White's lone King. I need to work towards checkmate.

Let me analyze: My Queen is on b1, my King is on g8, and I have pawns on f6 and g7. The White King is on d5.

The best approach is to start giving checks and drive the White King toward the edge of the board where I can deliver checkmate.

Qb5+ is a strong move - it gives check along the 5th rank and forces the King to move.

Looking at the position, I have a significant advantage with my queen against the lone white king. This is a winning endgame - I need to restrict the white king and force it to the edge of the board.

The white king is on d3 in the center. Let me play a strong centralizing move that restricts it severely.

make_move e5d4

This move puts my queen right next to the white king, controlling many key squares (c3, c4, d2, e3, e4 are all covered). The king will be forced to retreat to either c2 or e2, both moving toward the edge of the board where I can eventually deliver checkmate.

Looking at this position, I have a dominant Queen against the lone White King on c2. This is a winning endgame for me. Let me check the available legal moves to find the most efficient path to checkmate.

get_legal_moves

The position shows my Queen on d4 can deliver check and start pushing the White King toward the edge for checkmate. I'll play a check that restricts the King's options.

make_move d4c3

This move gives check (Qc3+), forcing the White King to either b1 or d1 (the only squares not controlled by my Queen). From there, I can systematically drive the King to the corner and deliver checkmate.

Looking at this position, I have a significant advantage with my passed pawn on f3. The White King on d4 is too far away to stop it.

The best move is to push the f-pawn closer to promotion:

Looking at this position, I have a decisive advantage with my Queen against the lone White King. I should work on restricting the White King and driving it toward the edge of the board for checkmate.

Let me give a check that restricts the King's movement significantly.

make_move f1b5

This move gives check and limits the White King to only two escape squares (d4 or d6), pushing it away from the center and making progress toward checkmate.

Looking at this position, I can see:
- White King on b8
- Black King on g8
- Black Queen on c1

This is a winning endgame for me. Let me check the legal moves to confirm my winning idea.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Looking at this position, I have a winning King and Queen endgame against a lone King. The White King is trapped on b8, on the edge of the board.

Let me deliver checkmate. I'll play Queen to c8 with check - the King will be forced to a7, and then I can deliver checkmate with Qb7#.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Looking at this position, White has played c3 (Saragossa Opening), which typically prepares for d4 to build a strong center.

A strong response is to take central space myself with d5. This is a classical approach that stakes a claim in the center and fights for control.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Looking at this position, White has played a setup with b3 and c3, likely preparing for a slow positional game. I already have my d-pawn on d5, controlling the center.

The most natural move here is to develop my knight to f6, which:
- Develops a piece to its ideal square
- Controls the important e4 square
- Supports my d5 pawn
- Prepares for kingside castling

Looking at this position, White has played an unusual opening with b3, c3, and Nh3. I have a solid center with d5 and Nf6 already developed.

Let me analyze the position. I can see I have good development with knights on c6 and f6, and my bishop is actively placed on f5. White has a somewhat passive setup with pawns on b3, c3, d3 and the knight sits awkwardly on h3.

I notice I can capture the knight on h3 with my bishop, but an even stronger move is to centralize my knight powerfully.

make_move c6e5

This move places my knight on the dominant e5 square where it:
- Controls key central squares
- Can jump to c4, d3, or f3 creating threats
- Is well-supported and hard to dislodge
- Maintains my strong bishop on f5

get_legal_moves

I notice some interesting knight moves. The move e5f3+ looks very promising - it gives check and sets up a powerful follow-up.

After Nf3+:
- If Ke2, then Nd4+ forks the king and queen on c2!
- If Kd1 or Kf1, Nd4 still attacks the queen

This is a winning tactic!

Looking at this position, I can see White has an active knight on f4 and the queen on c2. My bishop on f5 is well-placed, and I have a solid pawn on d5.

Let me check what moves are available.

get_legal_moves

I see several good options. I'll play a strong central move that attacks White's knight on f4 while strengthening my center.

make_move e7e5

This move kicks the knight and gives me a powerful pawn duo in the center (d5 and e5). The knight will have to retreat to a less active square.

I see the legal moves. Let me make my move now:

make_move e7e5

This move attacks White's knight on f4, forcing it to retreat, while establishing a strong pawn center with pawns on d5 and e5. It also opens up the diagonal for my dark-squared bishop on f8.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Looking at the board, I can see White has a knight on f4 that appears to be hanging! My pawn on e5 can capture it.

Let me verify this is sound: After exf4, White can recapture with the queen from c2, but I'll still have won a knight for just a pawn - that's excellent material advantage.

Looking at the position, I can see I'm playing as Black with my king still in the center. I have good piece development with the bishop pair and knight, but I should continue developing and prepare to castle.

Let me check the legal moves to find the best option.

get_legal_moves

The bishop on f8 is blocking kingside castling, so I should develop it to an active square. Moving it to c5 puts it on a strong diagonal pointing toward f2 and prepares to castle kingside next move.

I already have the legal moves list. Let me make my move now.

Looking at this position, I need to develop my dark-squared bishop to prepare kingside castling. The move Bc5 (f8c5) is strong as it places the bishop on an active diagonal targeting the f2 square.

Looking at this position, I have a very strong attack on White's king. My bishop on f2 is putting pressure near the king on f1, and my knight on e4 is very active.

The most forcing move here is **Nd2+** - a knight check that forks the king and attacks other pieces. After this check, the White king has very limited options since my bishop on f2 controls both g1 and e1 squares partially.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Looking at this position, I can see my bishop on f2 is very actively placed right next to White's king on f1. The rook on h1 is also looking vulnerable.

Let me check my legal moves to confirm the tactical opportunities.

Looking at the position carefully, I see a strong tactical shot. My bishop on f2 can move to g1, directly attacking the h1 rook. This creates serious problems for White:

- If Kxg1, then Qh4 threatens Qf2+ followed by Qf1# (checkmate). White would have to give up the queen with Qf1 to block, and I win it with Qxf1+
- If Ke2, I simply take the rook with Bxh1, winning the exchange
- If Rxg1, then Qh4 gives me strong attacking chances

Looking at this position, I have a bishop deep in enemy territory on g1. Let me analyze the tactical possibilities.

I notice my bishop on g1 can move to f2, giving check to the white king on f1. This looks very promising!

After Bf2+:
- If Ke1, then Bxh1 wins the rook
- If Kxf2, then Qh4+ followed by winning material after the king moves

This is a strong tactical shot that wins material.

Looking at this position, I can see White has developed bishops actively but hasn't fully mobilized (knight still on b1). My king is castled, and I have a solid pawn on d5.

I notice the move Qh4 (d8h4) looks attractive - it puts my queen on an active square, creates pressure toward White's king on f2, and could lead to attacking chances on the kingside.

Looking at the position, I can see my rook on d3 is actively placed. Let me analyze the tactical opportunities.

I notice White's bishop on e2 is only protected by the king on f2. If I attack it with my rook, White will have to respond carefully.

The move Rd2 attacks the bishop directly and puts significant pressure on White's position. If the king moves, I win the bishop. If White tries to defend with Nc3 or Bf1, I can continue with Rxg2 creating further threats against the h2 bishop.

Looking at this position, I can see my rook on d2 is very active. Let me analyze the key features:

- White has bishops on e5 and e2, with the king on f2
- I notice the bishop on e5 and the pawns on b5 and c5 could be targets

I see a strong tactical opportunity. If I play my rook to d5, I directly attack the bishop on e5. Once the bishop moves, I can capture either the c5 or b5 pawn.

If White tries Bxg7 as a desperado, I simply recapture Kxg7 and then take the c5 pawn - winning a bishop for just a pawn.

- My rook on e2 can move to e1, attacking both pieces simultaneously

This is a classic tactic - the rook on e1 will attack along the first rank, threatening both the rook on a1 and the knight on b1. White cannot defend both pieces at once:
- If the knight moves, I take the rook with Rxa1
- If the rook moves, I take the knight with Rxb1

Looking at this position, I can see I have an active rook on e1 and my king is relatively safe on g8. White's king on g3 looks a bit exposed.

Let me analyze the key features:
- White has a rook on h4 that I can potentially attack
- My rook on e1 is very active on the back rank
- I can centralize with tempo

I'll play a move that attacks White's rook while centralizing my own rook:

make_move e1e4

This move attacks the White rook on h4, forcing it to move or be captured. It also places my rook on a powerful central square where it controls important files and ranks.

Looking at this position, I'm down material and White has dangerous passed pawns on the queenside. I need to activate my rook to create counterplay.

The most active move is to bring my rook to the e-file, attacking White's rook on e4.

I see White has opened with 1.e3 (Van't Kruijs Opening). This is a somewhat passive opening move.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

White has played 1.e3, the Van't Kruijs Opening - a rather passive choice that doesn't challenge the center aggressively.

I'll respond with a strong central move, taking advantage of White's passivity.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Looking at the position, White has played a setup with pawns on c3 and e3, and I've already played d5. This looks like a Colle System or similar opening.

The most natural and strong move here is to develop my knight to f6, controlling central squares and preparing to castle.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Looking at this position, White has played a rather passive opening with a4, c3, and e3. I have a solid setup with my knight on f6 and pawn on d5.

I should develop actively and take advantage of White's slow play. A strong move here is to develop my light-squared bishop to an active square before potentially playing ...e6.

Looking at this position, I have well-developed pieces with my bishop actively placed on f5 and knights on c6 and f6. White has an awkwardly placed knight on a3 and hasn't castled yet.

I'll play a strong centralizing move with my knight:

make_move c6e5

This places my knight on a powerful central outpost where it controls key squares (d3, f3, c4, g4) and is difficult to dislodge. It also adds pressure to White's position while maintaining flexibility for my other pieces.

Looking at this position, I have well-developed pieces with knights on e5 and f6, and an active bishop on f5. Let me analyze the tactical possibilities.

I notice a powerful tactic here. The knight on e5 can jump to d3 with check! After Nd3+, White has limited options:
- If Qxd3, then Bxd3 wins the queen for a knight
- If Ke2, then Nxc1+ wins material

This is a winning combination!

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Looking at the position, I need to develop my remaining pieces and get my king to safety. My light-squared bishop on f5 is already well-placed, and my knight on f6 is developed. The priority is to move my dark-squared bishop so I can castle.

Let me consider the options for the f8 bishop:
- Be7 is safe and prepares castling
- Bd6 is more active, controlling the c7-h2 diagonal
- Bc5 puts immediate pressure on e3

I'll go with the active developing move that prepares castling while placing the bishop on a good diagonal.

Looking at the position, I have a solid setup with well-placed bishops on d6 and f5, and my knight is active on f6. However, my king is still in the center.

The most natural and important move here is to castle kingside to get my king to safety and connect my rooks.

Let me analyze the key candidate moves:
- **f6e4**: Centralizes my knight powerfully, attacking f2, d2, and c3
- **d5d4**: A central break challenging White's pawn structure
- **f5d3**: Trading bishop for knight

I'll play the strong centralizing move that puts immediate pressure on White's position.

Looking at the position, I can see Black has a very aggressive setup with the queen on h4, knight on e4, and bishops on d6 and f5. White's king is still on e1, looking vulnerable.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Looking at this position, I can see some strong attacking possibilities with my queen, knight, and bishops all actively placed against White's uncastled king.

Let me check the tactical possibilities here. I notice that f2 is only defended by the king, and my queen can deliver check there while also setting up further threats.

make_move h4f2

This move wins material by force! After Qxf2+ (check), if the king goes to e2, I have Nc3+ (discovered attack), and after the king moves, I can capture the queen on d1 with my knight. The combination wins White's queen.

Looking at the position, I notice my knight on e4 and bishop on d6 can coordinate to create threats against White's knight on f2. 

The move **Bg3** looks very powerful here because:
1. It attacks the knight on f2 which is already under pressure from my knight on e4
2. If the knight retreats to h1, I can play Bh2 trapping it
3. If the knight goes to d3, I can play Nf2 forking the queen and rook

Looking at this position, I'm down significant material (no queen), so I need to look for either active piece play or material recovery.

Let me analyze the key options:
- **f5b1** captures the knight on b1 (trading bishop for knight - equal value)
- **d6g3+** gives check, forcing the king to move or white to capture with Rxg3
- **f5c2** looks like it attacks the queen, but Qxc2 just wins my bishop

The knight on b1 is currently undefended, and capturing it with my bishop guarantees an even trade. While I'd love to find a tactical shot given my material deficit, the capture on b1 is concrete and solid.

Looking at this position, I have an interesting placement with a bishop deep in enemy territory on b1, and another bishop on d6. Let me analyze the tactical opportunities.

I notice my bishop on d6 can move to f4, where it would attack the e3 pawn and create a threat of Bxe3+ (check). This is a strong centralizing move that creates immediate pressure on White's position.

Looking at this position, I can see the White Queen on h5 is active but potentially vulnerable. Let me analyze my options.

I notice my bishop on b1 can attack the White Queen directly. The move **Bf5** attacks the Queen on h5, forcing it to retreat and gaining a tempo while also centralizing my bishop on a strong square.

Looking at this position, I can see I have two active bishops on f5 and f4, while White's queen is on h5. Let me analyze the position.

I notice there's a white pawn on e3 that my bishop on f4 can capture. Let me verify this is tactically sound - if White tries Qxf7+, I can simply play Rxf7 winning the queen! So that's not a real threat.

Taking the pawn on e3 wins material and opens lines against White's somewhat exposed king on e2.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Looking at this position, I can see White has a dangerous attack with the Queen on h5 and Rook on g5 targeting my kingside. My bishop on f5 is crucial as it defends h7.

Let me analyze the key options:
- If I play g6, it blocks my bishop's defense of h7, allowing Qxh7+
- Moving my bishop away also allows Qxh7+
- Playing h6 challenges the rook directly

After h6, if White tries Rxg7+ Kxg7, I win the exchange. If Rg6, then fxg6 wins material. If the rook retreats, I've successfully defended.

This is a critical position. The white queen on f7 appears to be giving check to my king. Let me see my legal moves.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

The white queen on f7 is giving check, and I only have two escape squares for my king. Let me analyze:

- **Kh7**: This keeps my king more centralized but leaves it exposed to potential checks along the diagonals and ranks with the bishop on e6.
- **Kh8**: Moving to the corner, while cramped, avoids some immediate tactical threats.

Given the dangerous configuration of White's queen and bishop, I'll move to the corner.

Looking at this position, White has played 1. c3 (the Saragossa Opening), which is a somewhat passive choice. I should take advantage by claiming the center.

Looking at the position, White has played an unusual opening with b3 and c3. I have a solid central pawn on d5.

The most natural move here is to develop my knight to f6, which controls central squares and prepares for further development.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Looking at this position, White has played an unusual setup with b3, c3, and h4. I have a solid center with d5 and my knight developed to f6.

I should develop actively. A strong move here is to develop my bishop to f5 before playing e6, which would otherwise lock it in behind my pawns.

Looking at the position, I have a nice setup with my knight on f6 and bishop actively placed on f5. White has a somewhat passive pawn structure with b3, c3, d3.

I should continue developing and prepare to castle. The move e7-e6 is solid - it reinforces my d5 pawn and opens the diagonal for my dark-squared bishop on f8, allowing me to castle kingside soon.

Looking at this position, I have an interesting choice. I see the white pawn on h5 could be captured, but I notice an even stronger move - centralizing my knight powerfully.

The move **Ne4** attacks the white queen on d2 while placing my knight on a dominant central square where it can't easily be challenged. This is a strong positional and tactical move.

Looking at this position, I have a knight on e4 that's very active. Let me analyze the tactical possibilities.

I notice my knight on e4 can jump to f2, which would be check against the white king on e1, and simultaneously attack the rook on h1. This is a classic knight fork!

Looking at this position, I can see some interesting tactical opportunities. I have two bishops actively placed on d6 and f5, and White's rook on h4 looks somewhat exposed.

Let me play a strong move that creates immediate threats:

make_move d6g3

This move attacks the White rook on h4, forcing it to move, while placing my bishop on an aggressive square near the White king on f2. This gains tempo and improves my piece activity.

Looking at the board, I notice the white king is unusually placed on f4, quite exposed. Let me analyze the position carefully.

I see my two bishops on g4 and h4 are well positioned for an attack. Looking at my legal moves, I notice that moving my bishop from h4 to g5 would place it on the same diagonal as the white king on f4 - giving check!

This is a strong forcing move that:
1. Gives check to the exposed king
2. Places my bishop on an active square
3. Limits the king's escape options

Looking at this position, I can see the white king is quite exposed on h3. Let me analyze the key features:

- My rook is on h6
- There's a white pawn on h5
- White's king is vulnerable on h3

The move **h6h5** (Rxh5+) is very strong here because:
1. It captures a pawn (material gain)
2. It delivers check to the exposed white king since there's nothing blocking the h-file between h5 and h3
3. The white king will be forced to move to an awkward square (g3 or g4)

Looking at this position, I can see the White king is very exposed on g5. Let me find a way to exploit this.

I notice that h7h6 would give check since a pawn on h6 attacks g5 diagonally. This is a forcing move that puts immediate pressure on the exposed king. After this check, if the king goes to f4, I can follow up with e6e5+ for another check, keeping the initiative.

Looking at this position, I can see I'm down significant material (Black is missing the Queen), but I have some very advanced pawns, especially that f3 pawn which is causing White problems.

Let me analyze my options:
- The f3 pawn is a strong asset threatening e2
- I have a central pawn mass on d5 and e5
- White's King on f2 is somewhat exposed

I think the best approach is to create maximum pressure with my pawns. Playing **d5d4** will attack the c3 pawn, and after cxd4 exd4, I'll have two very dangerous advanced pawns (d4 and f3) that could cause serious problems for White.

Looking at this position, I see my e5 pawn and White's d4 pawn are in tension. Let me develop my knight while putting pressure on White's center.

This develops my knight to an active square where it attacks both the d4 pawn and the a5 pawn. The d4 pawn is now attacked twice (by my knight and e5 pawn) and only defended by the queen, creating pressure on White's position.

Looking at the position, I have my knight well-placed on f5 and need to create some active play.

I notice an interesting tactical idea. If I push my e-pawn with **e5e4**, I attack the d3 pawn and if White captures with dxe4, my knight can jump to e4 with Nxe4, attacking the White queen on c3. This creates significant tactical problems for White.

Looking at this position, I can see White has a dangerous Queen on c7 and I'm under some pressure. Let me analyze the key features:

- White Queen on c7 is threatening my pawns
- My knight on f5 is actively placed
- I have an advanced pawn on e4 that can capture the knight on f3

The move **e4xf3** wins a knight outright! After capturing, even if White recaptures with Bxf3, I've gained significant material (a knight for a pawn). If White tries Qd8+ instead, my pawn on f3 remains strong and attacks the bishop on e2.

Looking at this position, I can see the White Queen on c7 is creating significant pressure on my queenside pawns. I need to generate counterplay.

Let me analyze the position. The White Queen on c7 is threatening my b7 and a7 pawns. I should look for active counterplay.

The most dynamic option is to challenge the Queen with my rook. By playing Rc8, I attack the Queen directly and can potentially follow up with Rc2+ if the Queen takes a pawn, giving me active piece play.

Looking at this position, I can see my rook is very actively placed on c2, and the white king on f2 is somewhat exposed.

Let me analyze the key tactical opportunity here:

If I play **Ng3+**, I give check to the white king. This forces the king to move, and then I can follow up with Rc1+ in most variations, winning the rook on a1 or significant material.

For example:
- If Ke1, then Rc1+ is devastating
- If Kf1, then Rc1+ also wins material

Looking at this position, I can see some interesting tactical possibilities with my rook on c2 and knight on g3. The white king on f2 looks exposed, and the white bishop on e2 might be a target.

Let me check what moves are available to me.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Looking at this position, I can see the white bishop on e2 is a tactical target. I have two ways to capture it - with my knight (g3e2) or with my rook (c2e2).

Taking with the rook gives check, which is more forcing and gains tempo. After Rxe2+, the white king must move, and I'll be up a full piece with an active rook.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Looking at this position, I'm significantly down in material (White has a Queen and Knight advantage), so I need to create tactical threats.

Let me analyze the position. My rook on e2 is very active, and White's king on g3 is somewhat exposed. I should look for checks to create pressure.

If I play Re3+, it forces the king to move:
- If Kh2, I can capture the knight with Rxa3
- If Kf4, Re4+ continues the attack
- If Kg2 or Kf2, I can win the b3 pawn with Rxb3

This seems like my best practical chance.

Looking at this position, I'm significantly down in material (Black has only king and 3 pawns vs White's queen, rook, knight and pawns). I need to play carefully to avoid immediate threats.

The key considerations:
- White's queen on b5 is very active
- White's rook on g1 controls the g-file
- My king needs to find safety

Moving to g8 gets my king to the back rank, away from central threats and potential checks, while keeping it on the kingside to support my h-pawn.

Looking at the position, I see my king on g6 is somewhat exposed with White's rook on g1 targeting the g-file. My passed h4 pawn is an asset I need to consider.

Moving my king to f7 seems like the best option - it gets my king off the dangerous g-file while keeping it relatively active and safe.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Looking at this position, I'm significantly down in material with only my king and three pawns against White's queen, rook, knight, and pawns. Let me analyze my options.

The king moves need careful consideration:
- Kg8 would allow Qg7# (checkmate)
- Kg6 leads to dangerous checks with Qf6+ patterns
- Moving to the back rank keeps me passive

I think centralizing my king with Ke6 gives me the best fighting chance, even though White will have checks. A central king can better support any pawn advances and stay more flexible.

Looking at this position, I'm significantly down in material. Let me analyze my options.

The white queen on c3 is very active and can give checks on several squares. I need to find a safe square for my king.

- If Kd5, then Qc4+ is a check
- If Kd6, then Qc6+ is a check  
- If Kd7, then Qc7+ is a check
- If Ke7, then Qc7+ is a check

Moving to f7 seems to give my king the most shelter from immediate checks while keeping options open.

The position is very difficult for Black. My options are limited king moves (f7g8, f7f8, f7g6) and pawn moves (b7b6, a7a6, b7b5).

I'll move my king toward a more active position. Moving to g6 centralizes the king slightly and keeps options open for potential king activity toward the queenside pawns.

Looking at this position, I'm in an endgame with my king on h7 and pawns on a7, b7, and h4. White has a queen on f4, rook on b1, knight on a3, and several pawns.

Let me analyze my options:
- King moves to h8, g8, g7, or g6
- Pawn moves with b7 or a7

Moving Kg6 could be dangerous as the queen could check me with Qf5+. Playing b5 immediately might allow Rb7 winning my a7 pawn.

The safest and most solid move is to centralize my king, which is important in endgames.

Looking at this position, I have a pawn on a2 that can promote! Let me analyze my options.

The most significant move available is promoting my a2 pawn. If I play a2a1q (promote to queen), my new queen will attack White's queen on f1 along the first rank. White will be forced to respond by capturing with Qxa1, but this is still my best practical chance in what appears to be a difficult position.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Looking at this position, I can see my black king is on g7, and I have very limited options. Let me analyze the two available moves:

- **Kh8 (g7h8)**: Moving to the corner would allow White to play Qf8#, which is immediate checkmate since my king would have no escape (g7 and h7 are both controlled by the rook on c7).

- **Kg8 (g7g8)**: This at least avoids immediate mate, though White still has a strong attack with Qf7+.

I'll choose the move that doesn't lose immediately:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Looking at this position, I'm in a very difficult endgame. White has a dominant position with the rook on c7, an active queen, and several pawns. My options are very limited.

Between the two legal moves:
- **g8f8**: Moves my king away from the g-file, giving it more potential escape squares
- **a7a6**: Advances the pawn but doesn't address the immediate pressure

Moving the king to f8 seems better as it keeps my king mobile and avoids potential threats along the g-file from the white king.

White has played the unusual Kadas Opening (1. h4). I'll respond with a solid central move to take control of the center.

This establishes a strong central pawn presence and opens lines for my queen and light-squared bishop to develop. Against White's flank opening, the best strategy is typically to occupy the center.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Looking at this position, it appears to be a d4/d5 opening where White has played the unusual h4. 

I have my knight already developed to f6, and my d-pawn is on d5. A strong move here would be to develop my light-squared bishop actively before playing e6 (which would block it in).

make_move c8f5

This develops my bishop to an active square where it controls important central squares and can't be blocked in by my own pawns. It's a classic idea from Queen's Gambit positions.

Looking at this position, I have a solid setup with my bishop actively placed on f5. My priority should be completing development and preparing to castle.

The move **Be7** (f8e7) is most natural here - it develops my dark-squared bishop, prepares kingside castling, and maintains flexibility.

I notice that White's king is still on e1 and the bishop on f2 is somewhat vulnerable. My bishop on e7 can reposition to create threats.

The move **Bc5** (e7c5) looks very strong here because:
1. It threatens Bxf2+ with check, winning the bishop
2. It also threatens Bxd4, winning a pawn
3. White cannot easily defend both threats simultaneously

Looking at this position, I have two active bishops and White's king is still in the center. Let me analyze the tactical possibilities.

I see a strong tactical opportunity. My bishop on e4 can move to c2, attacking White's queen on d2. After the queen moves, I can capture the rook on a1, winning the exchange.

Looking at this position, I can see my bishop on c2 is actively placed and I have a bishop on c5 as well. Let me analyze the tactical opportunities here.

I notice that my bishop on c5 can move to b4, which would attack White's queen on d2 and create a pin along the diagonal to the king on e1. This puts immediate pressure on White and forces a response.

Looking at this position, I have a well-placed bishop on d1 deep in White's territory. Let me assess my options.

Key observations:
- My bishop on d1 is active but potentially vulnerable
- My knight on b8 is undeveloped
- White has potential kingside threats with the bishops and knight

The most logical move is to develop my knight while putting pressure on the center:

make_move b8c6

This develops my last minor piece, attacks the d4 pawn, and opens up possibilities like ...Nb4 to harass the queen or ...Nd4 to occupy a strong central outpost.

- My knight can capture the rook on a1 (Nxa1)
- Ne1+ gives check
- Nd4 or Nb4 attacks the queen

The most concrete winning move is to capture the rook on a1. Even if White recaptures with the queen, I've won the exchange (rook for knight), gaining significant material advantage.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Looking at this position, I have a knight trapped in the corner on a1. Let me see my options to activate it.

Looking at the legal moves, I can play either Nb3 or Nc2. 

Nb3 directly attacks the White queen on c1, which is very strong - it develops my knight while winning tempo by attacking the queen.

Nc2+ gives check to the king on d1, which is also interesting.

I'll go with the queen attack:

Looking at this position, I can see my knight on b3 is very actively placed near the white king on d1. Let me consider my options.

The white king appears somewhat exposed, and I have a powerful knight that can cause problems. I notice that moving my knight to d4 would be a strong centralizing move that also attacks the e2 pawn.

Looking at this position, my king is on h8 and is in a very restricted position with the White Queen on f6 creating threats. I only have two options: Kg8 or Kh7.

Moving to g8 keeps my king closer to my rook on a8 and gives slightly more defensive coordination.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Looking at this position, I can see the white queen on h6 is threatening Qg7# checkmate. I need to address this immediate threat.

Let me analyze my options:
- If I play Rf7, White has Qf8+ Kh7 Qxf7 winning my rook
- If I play Rf6, after Qg7+ Kf7 Qxf6+ I still lose the rook
- If I play Kf7, my king escapes and the rook on f8 still defends

The key insight is that after Kf7, if White plays Qg7+ Ke8, my rook on f8 prevents Qf8+ (winning the queen if White tries it). This is the cleanest defense.

Looking at this position, my king on f7 is under significant pressure from the white queen on h6 and bishop on g6. I need to find the safest square.

Analyzing my options:
- **f7g8**: Going to the corner could be dangerous with the queen and bishop aimed at the kingside
- **f7f6**: Very exposed - walking into the queen's attack range
- **f7e7**: Gets my king away from the dangerous kingside, moving toward relative safety

The best choice is to escape toward the center/queenside.

Looking at this position, I need to evaluate my options carefully. Let me analyze the key threats:

- White has a Queen on g8 and Bishop on g6
- My King on c6 could face checks on various diagonals and files
- I have a solid pawn structure on the queenside

If I push the central pawns (d5d4 or e5e4), the Queen can give check on the opened diagonals and then capture the advanced pawn.

Moving my King to b6 gets it closer to my queenside pawns for shelter and avoids immediate diagonal checks like Qe6+.

Looking at this position, I can see:
- My Black King is on b6
- I have pawns on a7, b7, c7, d5, e5
- White has Queen on f8, Bishop on g6, and pawns including a dangerous one on h6

Let me check my available moves.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Looking at this position, I'm down significant material (White has Queen and Bishop vs my pawns only). I need to play actively with my king and try to advance my queenside pawn majority.

Let me check the position - my King on b6 can move to a5 to attack White's a4 pawn directly. This is an active approach.

Looking at this position, I have my king on a5 with some pawns for protection, and White has a queen on f8 with a bishop on c2. I have connected passed pawns on d5 and e5 which are my main asset.

The best strategy here is to push my central passed pawns forward to create threats. Advancing the d-pawn puts pressure on White and creates a dangerous passed pawn.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Looking at this position, I'm in serious trouble. My king on a5 is very exposed with the white queen on c5. I only have two legal moves available.

If I play b7b5, the queen can simply capture with Qxb5+ giving check.

If I play a5a6, I move my king away from the immediate pressure, though my position remains difficult.

I'll go with the king move to gain a bit of space and keep my pawns intact for now.

White has played 1. e4, a classic King's Pawn opening. I'll respond with the equally classical Sicilian Defense, which is one of the most popular and combative responses at the professional level. It fights for central control and often leads to dynamic, asymmetrical positions.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Looking at this position, I can see we're in a Sicilian Defense where White has played the Alapin variation (c3) along with an early h4 push. I have a knight developed to f6 and my c-pawn is already on c5.

The most principled move here is to challenge White's center directly with the classic Alapin Sicilian response:

make_move d7d5

This strikes at White's e4 pawn immediately, fighting for central control. After exd5, I can recapture with the knight (Nxd5), maintaining good piece activity and central presence.

Looking at this position, I can see a strong opportunity. White has an advanced pawn on e5, and I have well-developed knights on c6 and f6, plus a nicely placed bishop on f5.

The move c6e5 captures White's e5 pawn with my knight, gaining material while centralizing my knight on a powerful square where it attacks the f3 knight.

Looking at this position, I can see a Slav Defense structure where I've developed my light-squared bishop to f5. My dark-squared bishop on f8 is currently blocked by my pawns on e7 and g7.

The most natural move here is to play **e6**, which:
- Solidifies my strong pawn center
- Opens the diagonal for my f8 bishop to develop (to d6 or e7)
- Prepares to castle kingside

Looking at this position, I have a typical setup from a Queen's Gambit/Slav-type structure. My light-squared bishop is already actively placed on f5, and my knight is developed to f6. 

The most logical move is to develop my dark-squared bishop and prepare to castle. I'll play Be7 to complete my kingside development and prepare castling.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Looking at this position, I have a nice setup with the two bishops and active pieces. White's king is still in the center which I should try to exploit.

Let me look for a strong move. The knight on f6 can go to e4, which is a powerful central outpost.

make_move f6e4

This centralizes my knight aggressively on e4 where it exerts strong influence over the center and can't easily be kicked away. It also potentially opens tactical possibilities against White's uncastled king.

Looking at this position, I can see my bishop on h3 is well-placed on the kingside, and White's king is still in the center. Let me look for active moves.

I notice the g3 pawn appears to be undefended. My bishop on e7 can go to h4 to attack it directly.

make_move e7h4

This move puts immediate pressure on the g3 pawn, and if White doesn't defend it properly, I can win material with Bxg3. It also keeps my bishops active and maintains pressure on White's somewhat cramped position.

Looking at the position, I have two active bishops on h3 and h4 targeting White's kingside. White's king is still in the center, which is a weakness I should exploit.

I notice my bishop on h3 can capture the g2 pawn, which would win material and put pressure on White's rook on h1.

Looking at the position, I can see my bishop on h4 is actively placed and there's a white pawn on g3 that can be captured. The white king is still in the center and hasn't castled, which makes aggressive play attractive.

The move Bxg3 wins a pawn and maintains pressure on White's kingside. After the knight recaptures, I'll have a material advantage and White's king remains vulnerable.

This move puts my queen on an active square, directly attacks the h5 pawn, and also creates potential threats while eyeing the white queen on g3.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Looking at the board, I can see I'm playing as Black. Let me analyze the position.

I notice my queen on g5 has some tactical opportunities. Looking at my legal moves, I see that **Qf5** (g5f5) creates a powerful double attack:

1. It attacks the bishop on f4
2. It attacks the knight on b1 (along the diagonal)

White cannot defend both pieces simultaneously. If White tries Qd3 to defend the knight and attack my queen, I can simply capture the bishop with Qxf4, and after Qxf4, I've won a piece.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Looking at this position, I notice something very promising. The White king is stuck in the center on e1, and there's a tactical opportunity.

I can see that Qxb1+ would capture the knight with check! Since the queen would be on the same rank as the king (both on rank 1), the king must move before anything can recapture. Then I can take the rook on a1 as well.

This wins significant material - a knight and a rook!

Looking at this position, my queen on a1 is extremely active with the white king exposed on c2. I see a strong tactical opportunity.

The move **Qxb2+** captures a pawn with check, putting immediate pressure on the exposed white king. This is a forcing move that wins material while maintaining the initiative.

Looking at the position, I see White has an annoying bishop on d6. I should challenge it with my rook.

This move attacks the bishop on d6, forcing it to move or be captured. It also activates my rook and puts it on a central file.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Looking at this position, I can see some tactical opportunities against White's king on a1. Let me analyze the position more carefully.

I have two rooks (e8 and b6) and White has Queen, Bishop, Knight, and Rook. The White king on a1 looks potentially vulnerable on the back rank.

I'll play a strong move that creates immediate threats:

make_move b6b2

This move is very forcing! It threatens Rb1+ which creates serious problems for White:
- If Ka2, then Rxh1 wins the rook
- If White blocks with Qg1, then Rb1+ Qxb1 and I trade my rook for the queen
- If White plays Qb3 to defend, I can simply capture with Rxb3 winning the queen for a rook

Looking at this position, I can see my rook on b2 has an interesting tactical opportunity against White's exposed king on a1.

Let me analyze: If I play Rb1+, it's check and the king must capture (nothing can block). Then I can follow up with Rxf1+, winning the knight with check, and then capture the rook on h1 with Rxh1.

This combination wins significant material!

2. White must respond immediately
3. Even if White captures (Qxd2 or Nxd2), I've forced their pieces into defensive positions

I need to assess the current position before making a move. Let me first look at the board.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Looking at the position, I'm significantly down in material (White has Q+R+B+N vs my lone Rook). I need to create some counterplay.

The position shows White has potential pressure on the h-file with Qh2 and Rh1. I should try to create counterplay on the queenside.

make_move b7b5

This pawn break attacks the c4 pawn and aims to open lines for my rook to create some activity. In such a difficult material deficit, I need to seek active play rather than passive defense.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Looking at this position, I can see I have a strong passed pawn on c3 that's very close to promoting. Let me evaluate the position.

My c3 pawn is only two squares from queening, and pushing it to c2 creates immediate threats. After **c3c2**:
- It threatens to promote to a queen with c1=Q+
- If White plays Nxc2, I can respond with Re1+ creating serious threats
- If White tries Rc1 to block, I capture with cxc1=Q+

This is my most dynamic option that creates the most problems for White.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Looking at this position, I have a very powerful opportunity - my pawn on c2 can promote! Let me analyze the options:

If I play c2c1q (promote to queen), white can immediately capture with Rxc1.

However, if I play c2b1q (capture the knight and promote to queen), I give check to the white king on a1. If the king takes my queen (Kxb1), I've at least traded a pawn for a knight. If the king retreats to a2, I keep my new queen and have a winning advantage.

Looking at this position, I have a rook on e8, king on g8, and pawns on a7, c5, e6, f7, g7, h7. White has their king somewhat exposed on a1 with the rook on b1, queen on h2, and bishop on f3.

My best plan is to activate my rook and put pressure on White's position. By moving my rook to b8, I directly attack the white rook on b1 and create threats to infiltrate White's position. This also sets up potential moves like ...Rb4 to attack the a4 pawn.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Looking at the position, this appears to be a Queen's Pawn opening where White has played d4, c3, and the unusual h4. I have d5 and Nf6 already developed.

The most principled move here is to develop my light-squared bishop to f5 before playing e6, which would lock it in. This is a classic Slav Defense concept.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Looking at this position, I can see we're in a Slav-type structure with my bishop actively placed on f5 and knight developed to f6. White has played h4, possibly preparing to push g4 and challenge my bishop.

The most natural and solid move here is to reinforce my central pawn on d5 with a typical Slav pawn structure.

Looking at this position, I have a typical Slav Defense structure with my bishop already actively placed on f5. My development is progressing well.

I should continue developing and prepare to castle. The move e6 will solidify my center, support the d5 pawn, and allow me to develop my f8 bishop to prepare castling.

Looking at this position, I see an interesting tactical opportunity. White has pawns on b4 and d4 that look vulnerable.

The move Qb6 (d8b6) creates a double attack on both the b4 and d4 pawns. White cannot defend both simultaneously:
- If White plays a3 to defend b4, I take Qxd4
- If White plays Be3 or Nf3 to defend d4, I take Qxb4
- If White plays Rb1 to defend b4, I take Qxd4

Looking at this position, I notice an interesting tactical opportunity. The white queen on b3 appears vulnerable.

Let me analyze: my bishop on f5 can move to c2, directly attacking the white queen on b3. This forces the queen to move, winning a tempo. Additionally, if White tries to play Qxd5 in response, I would have Nxd5 winning the queen outright since my knight on f6 can reach d5.

Looking at this position, I can see White's king is still in the center on e1, which presents an opportunity. I have several tempting options here.

The knight move to e4 looks very strong - it centralizes my knight aggressively, attacks White's knight on d2, and puts pressure on the position while the White king is still uncastled.

Looking at this position, I can see the white king is still in the center which is vulnerable. Let me analyze my options.

I notice I can capture a central pawn with d5xe4, which:
- Wins a pawn
- Opens lines toward the white king
- Creates central tension

Looking at the position, I notice that Black has a well-placed bishop on b4 and White's king is stuck on d1. Let me analyze the options.

The bishop on b4 can capture the pawn on c3, winning material. After Bxc3, White will likely have to recapture with Bxc3, resulting in a trade of bishops where I've won a pawn.

This is a clean tactical gain - let me execute it.

Looking at this position, I have an advanced passed pawn on e4 that can create serious problems for White. The White king is still stuck in the center on d1, which is a significant weakness.

The move e4e3 is very strong here - it pushes my passed pawn deep into enemy territory, attacks the knight on d2, and creates threats against the exposed White king.

The move **b6b3** (Qxb3) stands out as very strong. By capturing the pawn on b3, my queen simultaneously attacks:
1. The white rook on a3
2. The white bishop on b2

This is a fork that wins material - White cannot save both pieces!

Looking at this position, I have a powerful passed pawn on d2 right near White's king. I should increase the pressure on the d-file to maximize its potential.

This move brings my rook to the d-file, directly supporting my advanced d2 pawn and putting pressure on White's king on d1. This creates serious threats and ties down White's pieces to defense.

Looking at this position, I have a powerful passed pawn on d2 that's currently blocked by the white king on d1 and covered by the bishop on c3. I need to create counterplay.

Let me analyze the key moves:
- My rook on d8 can't safely go to d4 because of Bxd4 winning the exchange
- I should challenge white's center and create threats

The move **e6-e5** attacks the d4 pawn and creates central tension. If white captures with dxe5, I can develop my knight to d7 and recapture. If white takes my d2 pawn with Bxd2, I can play exd4 with a protected passed pawn.

Looking at this position, I have a powerful passed pawn on d2 that's right next to White's king. My rook on d8 can become very active here.

The move **d8d3** looks excellent - it attacks White's rook on b3 while also supporting my dangerous passed pawn on d2. This creates immediate pressure.

Looking at this position, I have a very advanced pawn on d2 that's close to promotion, but the White king on d1 is blocking it. I need to find a way to either force the king away or create decisive threats.

Let me analyze the position further...

I see a strong tactical sequence: If I capture the bishop with my rook on d3, it sets up a powerful attack. After taking, my other rook can come to d8, creating unstoppable threats:
- If the king moves, my d2 pawn promotes
- If White blocks with Rc1, I can capture with dxc1=Q+
- If White blocks with Rd3, I can trade and still maintain winning chances with the d2 pawn

Looking at this position, I have a powerful passed pawn on d2 that's just one square away from promotion. I also have a rook on c3 that can deliver check.

The best move here is to play Rc1+! This forces the White king to move away from d1, and then my pawn can promote to a queen on the next move.

- Taking the knight with c1g1 would just lose material after White recaptures with the h1 rook
- c1c2+ delivers check to the White king on d2, forcing it to move and then I can grab the g2 pawn

The check is the most forcing move here.

Looking at this position, I'm down material (Black has one rook vs White's two rooks and a knight). I need to activate my pieces and create some counterplay.

The most logical move is to activate my rook and put pressure on White's rook on b3.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Looking at the position, I can see I'm in an endgame with material disadvantage (White has two rooks and a knight vs my single rook, though I have more pawns). I need to create counterplay.

Let me think about the key features:
- White has active rooks on b3 and h4
- White's h5 pawn is advanced
- My rook on b8 is somewhat passive
- I have a pawn majority on the queenside

I should try to advance my pawns and create counterplay. The move c6-c5 looks promising as it:
1. Prepares to push the c-pawn further (c4)
2. Opens up potential for my rook
3. Creates chances for a passed pawn

Looking at the board, I see I'm in an endgame with my rook on b8 and my king on g8. White has two rooks (b5 and h4) creating pressure.

The White rook on b5 is threatening my b7 pawn, but I have a strong passed pawn on c4 that I can push. Let me advance it to create threats.

make_move c4c3

This pushes my passed pawn closer to promotion, forcing White to deal with it. If White captures with the king (Kxc3), I can activate my rook with Rc8+. If White ignores it, c2 follows with a strong queening threat.

Looking at this position, I can see I have a dangerous passed pawn on c3. Let me check what my options are with those legal moves.

I notice that c3c2 is available - pushing my passed pawn to the 2nd rank, just one square away from promotion! This is a critical move since:
- The white king on b1 must respond to the promotion threat
- If the king takes on c2, I can try to activate my rook
- If the king moves elsewhere, I may be able to promote

This is my best chance given that I'm down material.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Looking at this position, I have a pawn on c2 that can promote! This is a critical moment.

Let me analyze: if I promote to a queen with c2c1q, it gives check to the white king on b2. The king's options would be to capture with Kxc1 or flee to a2, a3, or b3.

If the king doesn't capture, I keep my new queen and have a winning position. If Kxc1, I can follow up with Rb1+ to keep pressure on the white king.

Promoting to a queen with check is the most forcing move here.

The move **Rb7** (b8b7) looks best here - it:
1. Defends the b6 pawn indirectly - if Rxb6, I can recapture with Rxb6
2. Keeps my rook active on the b-file
3. Also defends the a7 pawn

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Looking at this position, I can see I'm facing some pressure. White has rooks on b5 and h4, and my b6 pawn is under attack from the b5 rook.

Let me analyze the key options:
- The b6 pawn needs attention as Rxb6 is threatened
- White has an advanced h5 pawn
- My rook on b7 is somewhat passive

I think challenging White's kingside pawn structure with **g7g6** is a good move. This attacks the h5 pawn and creates counterplay. If White takes with hxg6, I can recapture with either fxg6 or hxg6, creating active pawn play on the kingside.

Looking at the board position, I can see:
- My king is on g8
- I have a rook on b7 defending my b6 pawn
- White has rooks on b5 and h4, with a threatening pawn on h5

The h5 pawn is a threat - if I don't capture it, White could create attacking chances on the kingside. I'll capture that pawn to eliminate the threat and win material.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Looking at the position, I can see White has doubled rooks on the h-file which is threatening. My h6 pawn is under attack from the rook on h5.

Let me analyze this carefully. If I play Kg7, I defend the h6 pawn directly. And if White tries Rxh6, my king can capture the rook! Then after Rh4+, my king can escape to g5 or g6.

This seems like a strong defensive move that actually wins material if White isn't careful.

Looking at this position, I can see White's rook on f5 is attacking my f7 pawn. I need to address this threat.

Let me analyze my options:
- If I play **f7f6**, my pawn moves out of the attack, and if White's rook takes on f6 (Rxf6), my king on g7 can capture the rook (Kxf6), winning significant material!
- Moving my king away would allow Rxf7+ with check and loss of the pawn

The move f7f6 is a strong defensive move that also sets a trap.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Looking at this position, I'm under significant pressure from White's two active rooks. My king on g7 is somewhat exposed, and I need to find a way to defend or simplify.

Let me analyze the key threats:
- White's rook on f5 controls the f-file
- White's rook on h4 can swing to h7 or h8 with dangerous threats

I think my best practical chance is to offer a rook trade to simplify the position. By playing my rook to f7, I can potentially exchange rooks and reduce White's attacking force.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Looking at this position, I can see I'm under some pressure with White having two rooks, a knight, and pawns against my single rook and pawns. The white rook on f5 is eyeing my f6 pawn.

Let me analyze the key options:

1. **Kg6** - This centralizes my king (crucial in endgames) and directly attacks the rook on f5
2. If White plays Rxf6+, I can recapture with Rxf6, trading a pair of rooks which helps simplify the position given White's material advantage

Centralizing my king and forcing White to make a decision about the rook seems like the best practical approach.

Looking at this position, I can see my king on g6 is somewhat exposed and my f6 pawn is under attack from the white rook on f5.

- My rook on f7 is currently defending the f6 pawn
- Moving my king to safety is important

If I play Kh7, my rook on f7 still defends f6. If White plays Rxf6, I can recapture with Rxf6, trading rooks and reaching a more manageable endgame.

Looking at this position, I can see the white rook on f5 is putting pressure on my f6 pawn. Let me analyze the position carefully.

I notice that if I move my king to g6, I'll be attacking the white rook on f5. The rook appears to be undefended - the knight on f3 doesn't cover f5, and neither does the rook on h1.

If white plays Rxf6+, I can simply capture with Kxf6, winning the rook for just a pawn - a huge material gain!

If white tries to escape with the rook to g5, the knight does protect that square, but then I can play Kh6 attacking the rook again, and after Rxh5+ Kxh5, I still capture the rook.

This looks like a winning move!

Looking at this position, I'm in a difficult spot with White's rooks dominating the h-file. Let me analyze:

- White has two rooks (h5 and h1) putting pressure on my king
- I need to contest the h-file or face serious threats

The move Rh7 (f7h7) looks best here - it directly challenges White's rook on h5 and contests the h-file. If White exchanges, I at least trade off one of those dangerous rooks.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Looking at this position, I'm in a difficult endgame. White has a rook on f6 that's restricting my king, plus two pawns and a knight. I have two pawns, with one on b3 being very advanced.

My best chance for counterplay is to push that b-pawn to create a queening threat. This will force White to respond and potentially distract from their attack on my king.

The position is an interesting endgame. I can see:
- My black king is on h7
- I have pawns on a7 and b2 (very advanced!)
- White has a rook on f6, knight on g6, and pawns on e4 and g5

Looking at this position, I have a very advanced b2 pawn near promotion (though the white king on b1 blocks it), and my king on h7 is facing some pressure from the rook on f6 and knight on g6.

I notice that Nf8+ could be a threat, but advancing my a-pawn seems like the right strategic plan - creating two connected passed pawns that White can't stop with just the king.

h7h8,h7g7,a5a4

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Looking at this position, I can see my king on h7 is under pressure from the White rook on f6 and knight on e7. The knight on e7 controls the g8 escape square.

Let me analyze my options:
- **h7h8**: Moves to the corner, but keeps the king relatively safe
- **h7g7**: Walks into potential discovered attacks
- **a5a4**: Ignores the king's safety, risky with the rook and knight coordinating

If I play h7g7, White has Rf7+ and after Kh6, g6! threatens Rh7# (and Kxg6 allows Rf6#).

Moving to h8 is safest - if White plays Rf8+ Kh7, Rf7+ I return to h8 with a likely draw by repetition since Kh6 loses to g6! and Kg8 is illegal (knight covers g8).

- My Black King is on h8
- I have pawns on a5 and b2 (b2 is close to promotion!)
- White has a Rook on b6, Knight on e7, King on b1, and pawns on e4 and g5

The b2 pawn is tantalizing but the White King on b1 blocks it. Let me consider my options:

- **h8h7**: This would allow White to play Ng5+ with check, losing tempo
- **h8g7**: Activates my King and avoids any knight checks
- **a5a4**: Pushes the pawn but doesn't improve my King position

The best move is to activate my King while avoiding the knight check. Moving to g7 gives my King more freedom and avoids Ng5+.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Looking at this endgame position, I have two connected passed pawns on the queenside (a3 and b2) with White's King on b1 blocking the b2 pawn.

The key move here is to advance my a-pawn:

make_move a3a2

This creates a powerful threat: if White captures with Rxb2, I promote with a1=Q+ (with check!), winning the rook and the game. White cannot stop both pawns simultaneously.

Looking at this position, I'm in a difficult endgame with just my king against White's rook and two pawns. The g5 pawn is a major threat to promote.

Let me analyze my options:
- Moving to the back rank (Kh8, Kg8, Kf8) risks getting cut off by the rook
- Kh7 keeps me near the g-pawn but could allow Rb7+ with tempo
- Kf7 keeps my king centralized and gives flexibility

I'll play the centralizing move to stay active and try to blockade the g-pawn.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Looking at this endgame position, I have my king on g7 facing White's rook on b6 and a dangerous pawn on g6 (plus a pawn on e5 and White's king on a2).

The key threat is the g6 pawn which is close to promotion. My best option is to attack it directly.

make_move g7h6

This move puts my king on h6, directly attacking the g6 pawn. The rook on b6 cannot effectively defend the pawn - if it moves away, I capture on g6. This is my best chance to neutralize White's most dangerous passed pawn.

- h5h4/h5g4: Moving away from the pawn, letting it advance

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Looking at this endgame position, I have my king on h6 facing White's rook on d6, pawns on g6 and e4, and king on b1.

Let me analyze my options:
- **h6g7**: Puts me behind the g6 pawn, but allows Rd7+ check
- **h6h5**: Stays on the edge, allows Rh6+ check
- **h6g5**: Moves toward the center, more active

Moving toward the center is generally best in endgames. I'll go with:

The move g5h6 looks best - it attacks the g6 pawn and I can capture it next move. If White pushes g7, I can take it with Kxg7.

Looking at this position, I have my King on h6, and White has a dangerous passed pawn on g6 that's threatening to promote. I need to address this immediately.

Let me analyze my options:

- **Kh5 (h6h5)**: Moves away, allowing g7 and eventual promotion
- **Kg5 (h6g5)**: Attacks the pawn but allows g7

The best move is to stop the pawn from promoting by moving my king in front of it.

Looking at the board, I can see my Black King is on g7, facing White's Rook on a6, pawns on g6 and e5, and King on b1. This is a difficult endgame position with that dangerous g6 pawn close to promotion.

Let me analyze my options:
- g7h8 or g7f8: Moving away allows the g-pawn to advance toward promotion
- g7g8: Stays in front of the pawn but allows Ra8+ with back rank issues
- g7h6: Moves behind the g6 pawn, threatening to capture it (note: the pawn on g6 blocks the rook's attack on h6)

The best move is to attack the pawn directly. If White advances g7, I can capture it with Kxg7.

This is a King and Rook vs King endgame - a difficult defensive position for Black. My best strategy is to keep my King centralized and avoid being pushed to the edge of the board.

The White King is on a2 and the Rook is on h1. I should stay in the center as long as possible.

I'll move my King to e4 to maintain a central position.

Looking at this position, I'm in a King vs King + Rook endgame, which is a theoretical loss for me. My best strategy is to keep my king centralized and avoid being pushed to the edge of the board.

The white king is on a2 and the rook is on b1. I should stay central and active.

make_move e4d5

This keeps my king in the center of the board, making it harder for White to coordinate the checkmate. Moving toward the queenside also keeps my king closer to the opposing king, which can sometimes create defensive resources.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Looking at this position, I have a King vs King and Rook endgame, which is a theoretically lost position for me. However, I should play the best defensive moves.

The White Rook on b7 is cutting off my King from the 7th and 8th ranks. My strategy should be to stay as centralized as possible and avoid being pushed to the edge of the board.

I'll move my King to d4, staying relatively central while keeping distance from the rook.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

White has played 1. f3, which is known as Barnes Opening - a rather unusual and passive choice that doesn't control the center well and slightly weakens the kingside.

I'll take advantage by grabbing central space with a classic response:

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Looking at the board, I see White has played a rather passive opening with f3 and g3, while I already have my e-pawn advanced to e5. This is a great opportunity to seize the center.

The most principled move here is to establish a strong pawn center with d5, taking advantage of White's slow development.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Looking at the position, I can see that White has played a passive setup with c3, f3, and g3, while I already have a strong pawn center with pawns on d5 and e5.

The best approach here is to develop my pieces efficiently. I'll develop my knight to f6, which is a natural square that:
- Develops a piece toward the center
- Controls key central squares (e4, d5)
- Prepares for kingside castling

Looking at this position, I can see White has an unusual early queen placement on c2. I have good central pawns on d5 and e5, and my knight is developed to f6.

Looking at this position, I have a nice setup with knights on c6 and f6, pawns controlling the center on d5 and e5, and my light-squared bishop actively placed on f5.

My priority should be developing my dark-squared bishop and preparing to castle. The move **Bc5** (f8c5) looks very strong here - it develops the bishop to an active diagonal targeting f2 and clears the way for kingside castling.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Looking at this position, I can see that Black has developed nicely with both bishops actively placed and knights on good squares. White has pushed b4, attacking my bishop on c5.

The most important priority here is to get my king to safety and connect my rooks. My pieces are well developed, so castling kingside makes the most sense.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Looking at this position, I have a very active setup with both bishops well-placed and strong central control. Let me analyze the key features:

- White's king is still on e1 (uncastled)
- My bishop on c5 has a strong diagonal toward f2
- White's knight on g1 is still undeveloped

I see a strong tactical opportunity. The move Bf2+ gives check and forces White's king to move, disrupting their position significantly.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Looking at this position, I have a strong bishop on f2 near White's king and good piece activity. Let me analyze the options carefully.

I notice a tactical opportunity with my knight. The move Nh5 threatens Nxg3+, which would fork the White king on f1 and the rook on h1. Importantly, White's king cannot escape to f2 because my bishop is occupying that square!

This looks like a winning tactic.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Looking at this position, I have some interesting tactical possibilities. Let me analyze the key features:

- I have a bishop deep in White's position on f2, right next to their king on f1
- My knight on h5 has an interesting possibility

I notice that my knight can capture on g3 with check! After Nxg3+, the White king is in trouble:
- Can't go to f2 (my bishop is there, but king can capture it)
- Can't go to e2 (would be in check from the knight)
- Can't go to e1 (would be in check from my bishop on f2)

If Kxf2 (forced), then Nxh1 wins the rook!

This wins me the exchange (rook for bishop) plus a pawn - excellent material gain.

- Black has a strong pawn center with pawns on d5 and e5
- Black's bishop on f5 is actively placed
- White's king on f2 is vulnerable

I notice a very strong move - the queen can deliver check!

make_move d8h4

This is Qh4+, giving check to the White king on f2. The king has very limited escape squares since g1 is occupied by White's own knight, and moving to e1 would still be in check from the queen on the h4-e1 diagonal. This forces the king to e3, where it will be very exposed to further attacks.

Looking at this position, I have a strong center with pawns on d5 and e5, and my bishop on f5 is actively placed. Let me consider my options.

The move Nd4 stands out - placing my knight on a dominant central outpost where it attacks c2 and puts pressure on White's position. The knight will be very well-placed there.

Looking at this position, I can see I have some interesting tactical opportunities with my well-placed knight on d4 and bishop on f5.

Let me analyze the key candidate moves:
- **Nxf3+** - captures a pawn with check, forcing the king to move
- **Bxh3** - captures the knight but allows the king to recapture
- **Nb3** - forks queen and rook, but the queen can simply capture

The most forcing move here is **Nxf3+** - it wins a pawn, gives check, and places my knight on a powerful central square attacking the king. White cannot capture with Kxf3 because Be4+ would follow winning more material.

Looking at this position, I'm down significant material (no queen), so I need to create active threats.

I notice my bishop on h3 is near the White king. Let me look for tactical opportunities.

The move Bg2 is very interesting - it threatens Rf1# (checkmate). The king on g1 would have no escape: can't go to h2 (blocked by pawn), can't go to g2 (my bishop), and the f1 square would have my rook delivering mate.

However, I see my f8 rook is blocked by my own f7 pawn from reaching f1. But moving the bishop to g2 still creates pressure and wins the d5 bishop after White defends - my bishop on g2 will be able to capture on d5.

Looking at this position, I see the white Queen is active on e4 and the Bishop on f3 is eyeing the long diagonal. My king is relatively safe on g8 but I need to be active.

The most principled move here is to challenge the center and attack the Queen with a pawn push.

Looking at this position, I see the White Queen on e7 is attacking my rook on f8. Let me analyze my options carefully.

If I play Re8 (f8e8), the Queen can capture with Qxe8+, but then my other rook on a8 can recapture with Rxe8, winning the Queen for a rook! This is a significant material gain.

Looking at this position, I have an active rook on e1 deep in White's territory. The White queen on g5 is aggressive but I don't see an immediate mating threat.

Let me analyze my options. I notice that Re2 would attack the d2 pawn and create threats. Let me check if this wins material.

After Re2:
- I threaten Rxd2, winning a pawn
- If White tries Qd2 to defend, I play Rxd2 winning the queen!
- The rook becomes very active in White's position

This seems like a strong, direct move that wins material.

- My king on g8 is relatively safe but the Queen on h4 could become dangerous
- My rook on a8 is passive
- I have a passed d5 pawn that could become valuable

A strong move here is **h6h5** - this attacks the White Queen directly, forcing it to retreat and gaining space on the kingside while securing that flank.

Looking at this position, I'm significantly down in material (White has Queen, Rook, Knight, Bishop vs my lone Rook). I need to create some counterplay with my advanced kingside pawns.

The h5 and g5 pawns are my best assets. Pushing h5-h4 advances my most advanced pawn and prepares h3+ which could create threats against White's king on g2.

Looking at this endgame position, I have an advanced h-pawn that can create immediate threats against White's king position.

The move h4h3 is very aggressive - it pushes the pawn right next to the White king on g2, creating significant pressure and potential promotion threats.

Looking at this position, I can see I have some advanced pawns, particularly the h3 pawn which is very threatening. Let me analyze the best move.

The position shows:
- My h3 pawn is already very advanced
- My g5 pawn can advance to create a dangerous pawn duo
- I have an active rook on a8

The move g5g4 is very strong here because:
1. It threatens g4-g3+ with a devastating check
2. The h3 and g4 pawns together create serious queening threats
3. White's king on f2 is in an uncomfortable position

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Looking at this position, I have some dangerous passed pawns on the g and h files, but White's queen on e5 is very active and could create threats.

Let me check my options. Playing g4g3 looks tempting to push my passed pawn, but after Qe8+ Kh7 Qxf7, White wins a pawn and has a very active queen.

I think the most solid approach is to attack the queen while maintaining my position.

make_move f7f6

This move attacks the White queen and forces it to retreat, giving me time to consolidate and push my passed pawns. After the queen moves, I can look to advance g4-g3 under better circumstances.

Looking at this position, I have some advanced passed pawns on the kingside that could create threats. Let me analyze the position:

I see my pawns on g4 and h3 are quite advanced. The move g4g3+ would give check to the White king on f2 and create serious threats with my h-pawn. If White takes with hxg3, my h-pawn can advance to h2 threatening to promote. If the King moves instead, I can capture on h2 with strong promotion threats.

Looking at this position, I can see some tactical opportunities. My rook on f5 can become very active.

Let me analyze: If I play Rg5, I create a strong threat of Rg3+ which would fork the white king on f3 and the queen on b3, winning the queen!

Looking at this position, I have an active rook on g5 and an advanced h3 pawn. Let me analyze the tactical possibilities.

I notice that Rg3+ would give check to the White king on f3. This is a very forcing move that will gain tempo and potentially win material.

After Rg3+:
- If Kf2, then Rg2+ continues the attack
- If Ke4, the king is exposed in the center
- If Ke2, I can capture the c3 pawn

Looking at this position, I have some advanced passed pawns that can create serious threats.

Let me analyze the key options:
- **h3h2** - Pushes my h-pawn one square from promotion, creating an immediate threat
- **f4g3** - Captures the white pawn on g3, creating another passed pawn

The move h3h2 is very forcing. After this, White must respond to the immediate threat of h1=Q. If White plays Rh1 to block, I can then play f4g3, winning a pawn and creating a second passed pawn. White won't be able to stop both pawns from promoting.

Looking at the position, I can see my king is on g8 and I have a pawn on h2 close to promotion. However, my only legal moves are king moves, which means I must be in check - the White queen on d5 is checking me along the diagonal.

I need to escape the check. Looking at my options:
- g8h8: Corner, but allows Qd8+ continuing checks
- g8f8: Allows Qd8+ with more pressure
- g8h7: Gets my king off the diagonal and closer to support my h-pawn
- g8g7: Blocks but allows Qe5+

I'll move my king to h7 to escape the check while staying near my passed h-pawn.

Looking at this position, I can see I have a pawn on h2 close to promotion, but if I promote immediately with h2h1q, White's queen on h5 can simply capture it.

Let me consider f4g3 - this captures White's pawn on g3, and then I'll have two advanced passed pawns (on g3 and h2). White's queen can't stop both pawns from promoting!

After f4g3:
- If White plays Qh3 to cover both h1 and g2, I can play g2, and if Qxg2, then h1=Q
- This creates unstoppable promotion threats

After Rxh1, I can push g3-g2, and if White blocks with Rg1, I can capture the bishop with gxf1=Q+ with check!

Let me analyze the key features:
- My king is on g7
- My queen is on h1
- White's king is on d3
- White's queen is on f5

I notice that Qh3+ would be check! And if White blocks with Qf3, I can capture Qxf3+ winning the queen. If the king moves instead:
- Kc4 allows Qe6+ forking king and queen
- Ke2 allows Qg2+ forking king and knight
- Kc2 allows me to win the knight with Qg2

This is a strong tactical shot!

Looking at this position, I can see several interesting possibilities. Let me analyze the key tactical opportunities.

I notice the white bishop on f1 is undefended. My queen on h3 can capture it directly, winning material.

After examining the position:
- Taking the bishop with Qxf1 wins a piece
- If White tries Ng5+ after I take, my king can escape to h8 and there's no forced mate
- If White plays Qe1 trying to trade queens, I can accept the trade and be up a bishop in the endgame

Looking at the position, I have a pawn on g2 that can promote! Let me evaluate my options.

The g2 pawn can promote to any piece on g1. While the white rook on a1 and knight on f3 both attack g1, promoting to a queen is still my best chance to create complications in this difficult position.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Looking at this position, I'm in a very difficult situation. Let me analyze:

- My king is on h7 with just two pawns on a7 and b7
- White has a queen on e5, rook on g1, knight on f3, and several pawns

The immediate threat is Qg7# which is checkmate. Most of my pawn moves (b6, a6, a5) don't prevent this.

However, if I play **h7h6** (moving my king to h6), I escape the immediate Qg7# threat. White would then need to play Qg5+ and after Kh7, Qg7#. This at least delays mate by one move compared to the other options which all allow immediate checkmate.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Looking at the position, White has played 1. b4 - the Polish Opening (Sokolsky). This is an unorthodox opening that aims for queenside expansion.

The strongest response is to take control of the center. I'll play the most popular and principled reply:

make_move e7e5

This move grabs central space, opens lines for my bishop and queen, and challenges White's flank strategy with direct central control.

Looking at this position from the Sokolsky Opening, I have several good options. The most principled approach is to establish a strong center.

make_move d7d5

This move grabs central space, opens a line for my light-squared bishop, and establishes a solid pawn structure in the center. Black now has a strong presence with pawns on d5 and e5.

Looking at this position, I have a solid setup with pawns on d5 and e5, knight developed to f6, and bishop actively placed on b4. 

The most natural move here is to castle kingside to get my king to safety and connect my rooks.

Looking at this position, I have a strong center with pawns on d5 and e5, an active bishop on b4, and my knight well-placed on f6. White hasn't castled yet.

I'll play the thematic central break to challenge White's pawn structure and open lines for my pieces:

Looking at this position, I can see I have an advanced pawn on e4 and there's a white pawn on d3 that I can capture.

Let me analyze the key options:
- e4d3 captures a pawn, gaining material
- c8f5 or c8g4 develops my bishop
- e4e3 pushes aggressively but doesn't win material

Capturing the d3 pawn is the most concrete option - it wins material immediately.

Looking at the position, I can see I have a knight on e4 and an advanced pawn on d3. Let me analyze the key tactical opportunity here.

- White's king is somewhat exposed on f2
- The h4 pawn appears to be undefended

The move **d8h4** allows my queen to capture the h4 pawn, winning material. The queen will also be actively placed on h4, creating potential threats against White's king.

Looking at this position, I have a strong bishop on e2 deep in White's territory, and I see some tactical opportunities.

Let me analyze the key options:
- My knight on c6 can go to d4, creating threats of Nc2+ (forking the king and a1 rook) or Nf3+ (forking the king and h4 rook)
- My bishop can capture the f1 bishop

The knight move to d4 looks very powerful as it creates multiple fork threats that White will struggle to defend against.

Looking at this position, I can see my knight on d3 and bishop on f1 are well-placed to create threats against White's exposed king on d1.

Let me analyze the tactical possibilities. I notice that d3b2 would put my knight on b2, giving check to the king on d1. Importantly, the queen on f3 cannot capture on b2 since it's not on any of the queen's movement lines from f3.

This forces the king to move and keeps my initiative strong.

Looking at this position, I can see I have some active pieces - particularly my knight on b2 and bishop on f1 which are deep in White's territory.

Let me check the legal moves to find the best option.

get_legal_moves

The position offers a nice tactical opportunity. I notice my knight on b2 can jump to d3 with check, forking the White king on e1 and the bishop on f4.

After **Nd3+**:
- If White plays Qxd3, I have Bxd3 winning the queen for knight and bishop
- If White moves the king (Kf2, Ke2, or Kd1), I capture the bishop with Nxf4

This wins material in all variations.

Looking at this position, my knight on d3 is very actively placed. Let me check what's available.

get_legal_moves

I see I have several good options with my knight. The knight on d3 is attacking both the bishop on f4 and the pawn on b4. 

Taking the bishop with **Nxf4** looks strong - it captures an active piece and trades evenly (knight for bishop). If I take the pawn on b4 instead, White can counterattack with Qxb7 and potentially win my a7 pawn as well.

- My knight on f4 has several options

I notice that if I play **Nd3**, my knight would threaten the white queen on f2! This is a strong tactical move that forces White to react while also placing my knight on a dominant central square.

Looking at this position, I need to find an active move for my knight on d3. Let me analyze the key options.

The knight on d3 is well-placed. I can see that White has a strong queen on d4 and my king position needs attention. Let me centralize my knight to a powerful square where it can control key squares and potentially create threats.

make_move d3e5

This move powerfully centralizes my knight on e5, where it controls important squares like c4, d3, f3, and g4. The knight is well-protected and from this outpost it exerts pressure on White's position.

Looking at this position, I have a solid pawn structure but need to create some activity. The white rook on h4 and queen on g1 could pose some threats to my kingside.

I'll push my center pawn to challenge White's pawn structure and create counterplay:

make_move d5d4

This move attacks the c3 pawn and gains central space. If White captures with cxd4, I'll have an open c-file for my rook. If they don't capture, I have a strong advanced pawn.

Looking at this position, I have a passed pawn on d4 which is a key asset. I notice that my pawn on d4 can capture the white pawn on c3, which would both win material and create a dangerous passed pawn deep in white's territory.

The white rook on h4 could potentially capture on d4 if I don't act, so I should make use of this pawn.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Looking at this position, I have a dangerous passed pawn on c3. Let me analyze the key tactical ideas.

The pawn on c3 is just two squares from promotion, and I should push it immediately while creating threats.

After examining the position, if I push c3-c2:
- If White plays Qc1 to block, I can play Rd8, and after Ke2, Rd1 forces Qxd1, allowing c1=Q
- If White plays Nd2, then Rd8 attacks the knight, and any retreat allows c1=Q+ with check
- If White plays Rc4, then Rd8, Rxc2, Rd1+ wins the queen

The passed pawn creates overwhelming tactical threats.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Looking at this position, I have a very active queen on c1 while White's king is exposed on f2. The White queen on g4 and rook on h4 could pose threats to my kingside, so I should play actively.

I notice I can give check with my queen, putting immediate pressure on White's king.

make_move c1f1

This move Qf1+ gives check to the white king. The king will be forced to move (likely to e3 or g2), and my queen remains very active, potentially winning material or continuing the attack. This keeps White on the defensive while I maintain the initiative.

Looking at this position, I'm down significant material (facing a Queen and Rook with only my Rook), so I need to find active counterplay.

get_legal_moves

Let me analyze the position. My rook on e1 is active, and I notice the White king on f2 is somewhat exposed. Let me look for tactical opportunities.

The move Re2+ would give check since the rook on e2 attacks the king on f2 along the second rank. This creates potential for perpetual check - if the king goes to g1, I can play Re1+ (checking along the first rank), and if Kf2, Re2+ again.

Looking at this position, I have my rook on e2 and can see some tactical opportunities. The White King on g3 looks vulnerable.

Let me analyze: if I play Rg2+, that's check! The King will have limited options:
- If Kh4, I can continue with Rg4+ harassing the King
- If Kf4, I can play Rf2 pinning the Queen to the King

This is a strong attacking move.

Looking at this position, I'm significantly down in material with only pawns against White's Queen and Rook. I need to be careful about mating threats.

The White Queen on f3 and Rook on h3 create dangerous attacking potential. My main concern is preventing Qf6 which could threaten Qg7# or back-rank mates.

Let me play a solid defensive move that limits White's attacking options.

make_move g7g6

This move:
- Prevents the Queen from effectively using f6 for immediate mating threats
- Creates a potential escape route for my King via g7
- Maintains a more solid pawn structure on the kingside

- White has a Queen on b7 threatening my pawns on a7 and c7
- White has a Rook on h3 and King on g2

The White Queen is putting pressure on my queenside pawns. I need to get my King to a safer, more active square. Moving to g7 gets my King off the back rank (avoiding potential back-rank threats) and centralizes it slightly.

Looking at this position, I'm in a difficult endgame facing White's Queen and Rook with only my King and pawns. The immediate threat is Rxh7+ which would be check if my King stays on g7.

Let me analyze my options:
- Moving King to h8 leads to Rxh7+ Kxh7 losing the pawn with check
- Moving King to f8 means Rxh7 is NOT check, giving me a tempo
- Kf6 looks active but Rh6+ would be very dangerous

I'll move my King to a safer square where the Rook capture won't come with check.

Looking at this position, my king on g7 is under significant pressure from the white queen on e7 and the rook on h4. Let me evaluate the king moves:

- Kh8 allows Qe8+ followed by Qxh5
- Kg8 allows Qxf7+ or Qe8+ with strong attacks
- Kh6 walks into Qg5+ or Qf6+ with dangerous discovered attacks
- Kh7 seems most flexible, keeping escape routes open

I'll move my king to h7, stepping away from the immediate pressure while keeping options for defense.

Looking at this position, I can see my king is in serious danger with White's queen on c7 and rook on h4 creating mating threats.

Let me analyze the key threats:
- White threatens Qxf7+ followed by mating patterns
- My king is trapped on the h-file

The move g6-g5 offers my best practical chance. If White plays Rxh5, I can respond with gxf4, and after Qxf7+ Kh6, Qg6+ Kxh5! - I escape the immediate mate because the rook is gone. This gives me fighting chances even if the position is still difficult.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Looking at this position, my King is under pressure from the White Queen on f7. Let me analyze my two options:

- **Kh8**: This would likely lead to immediate checkmate with Qf8# (the Queen delivers mate with the Rook controlling the h-file)
- **Kh6**: This keeps the King more active and avoids immediate mate, though it's still a difficult position

I'll move my King to h6 to avoid the immediate checkmate threat.

Looking at the position, White has played a3 and f3 - a rather passive opening that doesn't contest the center effectively. I already have a pawn on d5, so I'll take advantage by strengthening my central control.

This gives me a strong pawn center with pawns on d5 and e5, taking full advantage of White's slow opening play.

Looking at this position, White has played a very passive setup with a3, f3, and h4. I have a strong central pawn duo on d5 and e5.

I notice that Qxh4 would win a pawn, but developing pieces is more important at this stage. The most principled approach is to develop naturally and take advantage of White's poor opening play.

I'll develop my knight to its most natural square:

I see a strong tactical opportunity here. Let me play aggressively in the center:

make_move f6e4

This move places my knight on a powerful central square, directly attacking White's knight on c3. If White captures with Nxe4, I recapture with dxe4 and maintain a strong pawn center. If the knight retreats, my knight dominates from e4.

Looking at this position, I can see my knight on e4 has some interesting tactical possibilities. Let me check the legal moves to find the best option.

get_legal_moves

The position looks rich with tactics. I notice my knight on e4 can potentially create threats. Let me analyze:

Looking at **Ng3** (e4g3): This move would attack:
- The White Queen on e2
- The White Rook on h1
- The White Bishop on f1

This is a powerful triple fork! The queen cannot capture the knight on g3 (not a valid queen move from e2), and no other white piece can take on g3 either.

White will be forced to move the queen, and then I win the rook on h1.

Looking at this position, I can see White has a knight on b5 that could be annoying, but I notice something better. My bishop on c5 can capture the pawn on e3 with check since the White king is on f2!

Looking at this position, I notice the white king is very exposed on b4. Let me look for tactical opportunities.

I see that I can play my knight to c6, which would give check to the white king and the knight would be protected by my b7 pawn. This is a strong attacking move.

My knight on a5 can move to b3, which would create a powerful double attack - threatening both the rook on a1 and the bishop on d2. White cannot defend both pieces simultaneously.

If White tries Nc7 to attack my rook on a8, I can simply move my rook (like Rb8) and still maintain the threats against the rook and bishop.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Looking at the board, I can see several interesting possibilities. The white king on b4 is somewhat exposed, and I have a knight on b3 that can create problems.

Let me analyze the key options:
- **b3d2** - My knight captures the bishop on d2, winning a piece outright
- **d3e2** - My pawn captures the knight on e2, but White can recapture with Bxe2
- **b3c5+** - A check, but after the king moves, I don't have a devastating follow-up

The move **Nxd2** is the cleanest - it wins the bishop for nothing. Even if White tries Nc7 to fork my rooks, I can simply play Rac8 or Rfc8 attacking the knight, and White can't recover the material.

Looking at this position, I can see my knight on f1 has an excellent opportunity. Let me analyze the key features:

- White's king is exposed on c5
- I have a dangerous passed pawn on d3
- My knight on f1 can capture the undefended rook on h2!

This is a clear win of material - I'll take the rook.

I notice that c8c4 attacks the white knight on e4 directly with my rook. This is a strong move because:

1. The knight on e4 is undefended
2. If the knight moves, I can improve my position further with my passed d3 pawn
3. My rook becomes more active on c4

Looking at this position, I have a strong passed pawn on d3 and an active rook on c4. Let me check the legal moves to find the best continuation.

I see I have c4b4 available, which gives check to the white king on b5. This is a powerful move because after the king moves, I can push my d-pawn to d2 with devastating threats:
- If White takes my rook with Rxb4, I play d1=Q and get a queen
- If White plays Nxd2 to capture the pawn, I take the rook with Rxb1

Looking at the position, I see I have a powerful passed pawn on d3 and an active rook on c4. The move c4b4+ gives check to the white king on b5, which is very strong.

After the king moves (e.g., Ka6), I can play d3d2 with devastating threats:
- If White plays Rd1 to block, I play Rb1! and after Rxb1, d2d1=Q wins
- If White plays Nxd2, I capture the rook with Rxb1, winning the exchange

The position shows my passed d-pawn is just one square away from promotion. This is a critical asset I should push forward. Advancing d3-d2 will:

3. Free up my knight to attack White's weaknesses

Looking at this position, I have a knight on h2 that needs to be activated. Let me analyze the key features:

- White's king is exposed on b5
- I have a knight on h2 that can become more active
- White has pawns on b4, f3, g2, and h4

The move **h2f3** looks strong - it places my knight on a more active square and attacks the h4 pawn.

Looking at this position, I can see I have a powerful passed pawn on f2, just one square away from promotion, but it's blocked by the white rook on f1.

The key is to attack the rook while exploiting my passed pawn. If I play Rf8, I attack the white rook on f1 and create a winning situation:
- If White plays Rxf2, I recapture with Rxf2, winning the rook for just a pawn
- If White moves the rook elsewhere, my pawn promotes to a queen with f1=Q

get_legal_moves showed me f8a8 is available - this gives check and starts a winning tactical sequence. After Ra8+, the king must move, then I can play Ra1, attacking the rook. The white rook cannot abandon the f1 square or my pawn promotes!

Looking at this position, I have a rook on f8, king on g8, and pawns on the 7th rank. White has an exposed king on a4, rook on f1, knight on f2, and pawns on b4 and h4.

I see a good opportunity to create counterplay on the queenside. By playing a7-a5, I attack the b4 pawn and can open the a-file for my rook. If White takes with bxa5, I can win the pawn back with Ra8 and Rxa5. If White plays b5, then my a-pawn becomes a dangerous passed pawn.

Looking at the position, I can see an interesting opportunity. The white king on a4 is exposed, and I can capture the b4 pawn with my a5 pawn.

This move:
- Wins a pawn
- Creates pressure on the white king
- Gives me a passed pawn on the queenside

Looking at this endgame position, I have a material advantage with 4 pawns against White's 1 pawn, knight, and rook. My strategy should be to push my pawns toward promotion.

The b-pawn is furthest from White's pieces (which are all on the kingside), so advancing it makes the most sense. The White King on c4 will have to respond, but I can start creating a passed pawn threat on the queenside.

Looking at this position, I'm down significant material (my pawns vs White's rook, knight, and pawn). My best chance is to push my passed b-pawn which is far from White's pieces.

The b5 pawn is my most dangerous asset - it's a passed pawn far from the White king on d5 and the White pieces clustered on the h-file.

I can see a tactical opportunity here! Let me play a move that attacks both the white king and the rook at the same time.

This is a queen check on b5 that creates a fork - attacking the white king on c6 and the white rook on a5 simultaneously. After the king moves to safety, I'll capture the rook, winning significant material.

Let me check the legal moves to find the best option.

get_legal_moves

I see my options. I need to be careful here - if I play Kg6, White has Rg5+ which would win my g7 pawn. 

The move **Kh6** looks strong because:
- It protects my h5 pawn
- If White plays Rxh5+, I simply capture with Kxh5 winning the rook
- If White plays Ng3 threatening h5, my king already defends it

Let me analyze the key moves:

- **g7g5** would be a mistake because hxg5+ is check, and I'd lose a pawn.
- **h6h7** or **h6g6** would expose my king to immediate rook checks (Ra7+ or Ra6+).
- **g7g6** creates a solid pawn shelter and gives my king a retreat square on g7.

I'll play the solid move that improves my king's safety:

Looking at this position, I need to evaluate my options carefully.

I have my king on h6, pawns on f7, g5, and h5. White has their king on b6, rook on a6, knight on f1, and a pawn on h4.

The key strategic consideration is that White's pieces are mostly on the queenside, far from my pawns. I should try to create a passed pawn that can advance quickly.

If I play **g5g4**, I create a passed pawn on g4 that is protected by my h5 pawn. This is stronger than capturing on h4, which would give me doubled h-pawns. The passed g-pawn can march forward (g3, g2, g1) while the knight on f1 is the only piece that can try to stop it.

Looking at this endgame position, I need to assess it carefully. Let me check my legal moves.

get_legal_moves

I see the position:
- I have my King on g6 and pawns on f7, h5, and g4
- White has King on b6, Rook on a6, pawn on h4, and Knight on h1

My key asset is the advanced g4 pawn. However, if I play g4g3 immediately, White can capture with Nxg3.

The best plan is to play **Kf5** - this move:
1. Protects the g4 pawn
2. Centralizes my king
3. If White plays Ng3+, I can capture with Kxg3, winning the knight

Looking at this position, I have my king on f5, pawns on f7, h5, and g4. White has a king on b6, rook on a4, pawn on h4, and a knight stuck on h1.

The most active plan is to push my advanced g-pawn. The knight on h1 is poorly placed and will struggle to stop the pawn. If the knight comes to f2, I can push to g2 and queen.

- White has a Rook on a8, King on b6, pawn on h4, and Knight on h1

My g3 pawn is very advanced and close to promotion. Let me analyze the best approach.

If I play Kg4, I threaten to support my g-pawn's advance and also attack the h4 pawn. After 2.Rg8+ Kxh4, then 3.Rxg3 Kxg3 - I actually win White's rook!

This tactical sequence wins decisive material.

The move g4h4 captures White's pawn and puts my king in a strong position. If White tries to capture my g3 pawn with Rxg3, my king on h4 can simply recapture the rook with Kxg3! Similarly, if White plays Rh3+, I can capture with Kxh3.

Looking at this position, I have a passed pawn on g3 that's very close to promotion. Let me analyze the key moves.

If I push g3g2, I threaten to promote. White's main defenses are:
- Ng3+ which I can capture with Kxg3, winning the knight
- Rg3+ which leads to complex play where my king can go to h3, and if Rxg2 then Kxg2 wins the rook!

The g-pawn push creates immediate threats that are hard to meet.

This is a winning position for me. Let me find the most accurate move.

Looking at my options, I see that **Qc3** attacks the rook directly. If the rook tries to escape with Rh2+, after Kg5, and if Rxh5+, I can simply capture with Kxh5 winning the rook. Any other rook move along the b-file allows me to capture it with my queen.

Looking at this position, I can see:
- White: King on b5, Rook on b2
- Black (me): King on h4, Queen on c3, Pawns on f7 and h5

My queen on c3 is directly attacking the rook on b2 along the diagonal. Let me verify my options.

Looking at the board, I can see:
- White King on a4
- My Black King on h4
- My Black Queen on b2
- My Black pawns on f7 and h5

This is a winning position for me. Let me look for checkmate...

If I play Qb4+, the White king is forced to Ka3 (only legal move since a5 and b5 are covered by the queen). Then I can play Qb3# which is checkmate because all escape squares (a2, a4, b2, b4) are covered by the queen.

My strategy should be to advance my pawns while using my king to support them. The white king cannot stop both pawns.

- My black queen is on e4
- My black pawn is on f7

This is a winning endgame for me. I need to use my queen to force the white king to the edge of the board and deliver checkmate.

Let me check the legal moves to find the best continuation.

get_legal_moves

I see a strong option. I'll play a check that restricts the white king's movement.

This move Qe2+ gives check and forces the white king to either c1 or c3, pushing it toward the edge of the board where I can eventually deliver checkmate.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Looking at the position, I have a significant material advantage with my Queen against White's lone King. Let me look for a forcing move.

get_legal_moves shows I have several checking moves available. I'll play a check to start pushing the White King toward the edge of the board where I can eventually deliver checkmate.

make_move e2d2

This is check (Qd2+), forcing the White King to move. The King will have to go to either b3 or c4, and I can continue to restrict it and push it toward the edge of the board for a mating attack.

I see the legal moves again. Let me make my move to continue the mating attack.

This is Qc4+, giving check to the White King on c3. The King will be forced to move to b3, d3, or b2, and I can continue restricting it toward the edge of the board where I can deliver checkmate with my Queen and King.

Looking at the board, I can see I have my king on g5 and a pawn on f7, while White only has their king on c4. This is a winning endgame for me - the white king is too far away to stop my pawn from promoting.

The key is to advance my pawn while using my king to support it. Let me push the pawn two squares to gain space quickly.

Looking at this position, I have my King on f3, my pawn on f4, and the White King is on d4. My king is currently blocking my own pawn from advancing.

I need to move my king out of the way while keeping it in position to support the pawn's promotion. Let me analyze:

- **Kg4** seems strong - it clears the path for the pawn to advance to f3, and keeps my king active to support the pawn's march to promotion.

The key line would be: 1...Kg4 2.Ke4 f3 3.Ke3 Kg3! (the crucial position where my king supports the pawn) and the pawn will promote.

Looking at this position, I have a black king on g4, a black pawn on f4, and the white king is on d3.

This is a pawn endgame where I need to advance my passed pawn. The key is to push the pawn while keeping my king in position to support it.

The best move is to advance the pawn:

make_move f4f3

This pushes my pawn closer to promotion. If White plays Ke3 to attack the pawn, I can defend with Kg3, and the pawn will eventually queen.

Looking at this position, I have a Black king on g4 and a Black pawn on f3, while White only has a king on c2. This is a winning endgame for me.

The White king is too far away to stop my pawn from promoting. The best move is to push the pawn forward.

Looking at this position, I have a king and queen versus a lone king - a winning endgame for black.

Let me analyze:
- Black king on g4
- Black queen on f1
- White king on b2

I should work to restrict the white king and force it to the edge of the board. A good approach is to give check while cutting off escape squares.

make_move f1f2

This move Qf2+ gives check along the second rank, forcing the white king to move while restricting its mobility. The king will be pushed toward the edge of the board where I can deliver checkmate.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Looking at this position, I have a Queen and King versus a lone King. Let me analyze the position to find the strongest continuation.

The White King on b3 is already somewhat restricted. Let me look for a move that limits its escape squares and potentially sets up a quick checkmate.

I notice that **Qd4** is a very strong move - it controls the 4th rank (blocking Ka4, Kb4, Kc4), the d-file, and key diagonals (blocking Kb2 and Kc3). This leaves the White King with only three squares: a2, a3, or c2.

The key line is:
- If **Ka2**, then **Qb2#** is checkmate! (The Queen covers a1, a3, b1, b3 - all escape squares)
- If **Kc2**, then **Qd2+ Kb1 Qd1+** leads to forced mate

The White king is on c2, and I need to force it to the edge for checkmate. I'll play a forcing move.

make_move d4c3

This is Qc3+, giving check and driving the White king toward the corner. If the king goes to b1, I can continue with Qb3+ Ka1, followed by Qb2# checkmate.

White has played the unusual a3 (Anderssen Opening), which is quite passive and doesn't fight for the center. I should take advantage of this by occupying the center with a strong move.

I'll play d5, staking a claim in the center and opening lines for my queen and light-squared bishop.

Looking at this position, White has played a somewhat passive setup with a3 and d3. I have a solid central pawn on d5.

The most natural developing move is to bring out my knight to f6, which controls central squares and prepares for kingside castling.

Looking at the position, I see I've developed my knight to f6 and have a pawn on d5. White has played a slow setup with pawns on a3, d3, and e3.

A good developing move here is to bring out my light-squared bishop to an active square before potentially blocking it with e6.

Looking at this position, I have my bishop actively placed on f5 and a knight on f6. White's queen on f3 is quite active. I should continue developing my pieces.

Looking at this position, I can see the white Queen is on f5 and I have knights on f6 and e5. Let me analyze the key opportunities here.

I notice that my knight on e5 can capture the pawn on d3 with check! This move (Nxd3+) is excellent because:
1. It wins a pawn
2. It delivers check to the white king
3. The knight on d3 cannot be captured immediately
4. The knight will be very active, attacking squares like c1, f2, and b2

Looking at this position, I'm playing a Scandinavian-type structure with my d5 pawn and knight on f6. I need to continue development and prepare to castle.

The move **e7e6** makes the most sense here - it:
- Solidifies my d5 pawn
- Opens the diagonal for my dark-squared bishop on f8
- Prepares for quick kingside castling

Looking at this position, I can see we're in a Queen's Gambit type structure. White has an active Queen on d3 and hasn't castled yet. My priority should be development and king safety.

Let me analyze the key options:
- **Bb4+** - An interesting check, but could lead to complications
- **Be7** - Solid development, preparing to castle kingside
- **dxc4** - Wins the pawn but Qxc4 recaptures immediately

I'll go with the solid developing move that prepares castling:

The most natural and important move here is to castle kingside to get my king to safety and connect my rooks.

Looking at this position, I see a typical structure where White has a strong knight on d4. I should challenge it and fight for central control.

Let me analyze the key options:
- **c7c5** - challenges the knight on d4, a typical freeing move
- **Nf6e4** - actively attacks the queen
- **e7b4** - pins the knight on d2

The move c7c5 is a thematic pawn break that challenges White's centralized knight and gains space. This is a principled approach.

Looking at this position, I see a typical Semi-Tarrasch or hanging pawns structure. White has a strong knight on d4 but hasn't castled yet. I notice my knight on f6 can jump to a powerful central square.

The move **Nf6-e4** looks very attractive - it places my knight on a dominant central outpost and attacks White's queen on d3.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Looking at the board, I can see I have a knight on e4 in a powerful central position and White has a knight on b5 potentially threatening Nc7. Let me analyze the tactical possibilities.

I notice my knight on e4 can go to f2, which would attack both White's queen on d3 and the rook on h1 simultaneously! Let me verify the consequences:

- If White plays Qxf2 to capture my knight, I have Rxf2+ (check!), and after Kxf2, I've traded my knight and rook for White's queen - a material gain!
- If White moves the queen elsewhere to safety, I play Nxh1 winning the rook outright.

This is a winning tactic.

Looking at this position, I can see White has a knight on b5 that could become dangerous, and their queen is active on d3. I notice an opportunity to create dual threats with my queen.

make_move d8b6

This move attacks the knight on b5 while also threatening Qxf2+, putting pressure on White's king. It's a strong centralizing move that creates immediate tactical problems for White.

Looking at this position, I can see White has a knight on b5 that's somewhat annoying. Let me evaluate the options.

The knight on b5 is well-placed and could potentially jump to c7 if I'm not careful. I should put pressure on it. Moving my queen to a5 attacks the knight directly while keeping my queen active on the queenside.

You are a professional chess player and you play as black. Now is your turn to make a move. Before making a move you can pick one of the following actions:
- 'get_current_board' to get the schema and current status of the board
- 'get_legal_moves' to get a UCI formatted list of available moves
- 'make_move <UCI formatted move>' when you are ready to complete your turn (e.g., 'make_move e2e4')

Looking at this position, I have a very advanced passed pawn on d3 and an active bishop on h4. Let me analyze the key tactical opportunities.

I notice my bishop on h4 can deliver check on f2, which will force the white king to move and then I can follow up with pushing my dangerous d-pawn.

Looking at this position, I have a very advanced passed pawn on d3. The most powerful move here is to push it further, creating a serious promotion threat.
