--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, I've got the list of legal moves. Let's analyze them.

The most common and often best approach in the opening is to develop pieces and control the center. Looking at the pawn moves, I see I can push the pawns in front of my pieces. The knight on b8 has several options. The bishop on f8 also has a few options.

Considering the position, I think developing the knight to c6 is a good developing move. It controls central squares and prepares to challenge white's control of the center.

So, my move is Nc6.

Alright, I have the list of legal moves. Let's analyze the position. White has advanced their e-pawn, and I need to respond. I see a few options. Developing the Queen's Bishop seems like a good idea. I could move it to e7, d6, c5, b4, or a3. Moving the pawn to h6 or h5 seems like a good idea to prevent a potential attack on the kingside.

I think I'll develop my Queen's Bishop to d6. It controls important squares and prepares for further development.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, I've got a good list of moves. Let's analyze.

*   **Pawn moves:** I have a lot of pawn moves available. Pushing pawns in front of the king (h7h6, g7g6) is generally a good idea for king safety, but it also weakens the pawn structure. Pushing the b-pawn (b7b6, b7b5) or a-pawn (a7a6, a7a5) doesn't seem particularly urgent.
*   **Knight moves:** The knight on f6 has several options. Nf6-g8 is a retreat, which isn't ideal. Nf6-h5 looks interesting, attacking the pawn on g3. Nf6-d5 is a good developing move, controlling the center. Nf6-g4 and Nf6-e4 are also possibilities.
*   **Queen moves:** The queen has a few options, but none of them seem particularly strong right now.
*   **Rook moves:** The rook on a8 has a couple of moves.

Considering the position, I think developing the knight to d5 is the best move. It controls important central squares and prepares for further development.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, I've got a lot of options. Let's break this down.

*   **King moves:** e8f8, e8e7, e8g8 - These seem a bit passive right now.
*   **Queen moves:** d8e7, d8f6, d8g5, d8h4 - The queen is a powerful piece, and developing it is often a good idea. d8f6 looks interesting, controlling the center and eyeing the weak f2 pawn.
*   **Rook moves:** h8g8, h8f8, a8b8 - These are less active at the moment.
*   **Bishop moves:** d6f8, d6e7, d6c5, d6b4, d6a3 - The bishop on d6 has some good diagonals. d6f8 is interesting, but it blocks the rook. d6e7 looks solid.
*   **Knight moves:** c6b8, c6e7, c6a5, c6d4, c6b4 - The knight on c6 has some good options.
*   **Pawn moves:** h7h6, g7g6, f7f6, b7b6, a7a6, h7h5, g7g5, f7f5, b7b5, a7a5 - These are standard pawn moves.

Considering the position, I think developing the queen to a more active square is a good idea. **d8f6** looks like a strong developing move, putting pressure on the center and potentially targeting the f2 pawn later.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, that's a lot of moves! Let's analyze the position. White has a strong center, and my queen is somewhat exposed. I need to develop my pieces and challenge white's control of the center.

I see a few options:

*   **...h7-h6** or **...h7-h5**: These moves are passive and don't really help me develop.
*   **...g7-g6** or **...g7-g5**: Similar to the h-pawn moves, not very active.
*   **...b7-b6** or **...b7-b5**: These moves are also passive and don't help me develop.
*   **...a7-a6** or **...a7-a5**: These moves are also passive and don't help me develop.
*   **...e8-e7**: This move seems reasonable to develop the king.
*   **...f6-e7**: This move seems reasonable to develop the knight.
*   **...f6-g8**: This move seems reasonable to develop the knight.
*   **...f6-h6**: This move seems reasonable to develop the knight.
*   **...d6-e7**: This move seems reasonable to develop the bishop.
*   **...d6-c5**: This move seems reasonable to develop the bishop.
*   **...d5-e7**: This move seems reasonable to develop the pawn.
*   **...d5-b6**: This move seems reasonable to develop the pawn.

I think developing the knight is the best option here. I'll move the knight to e7.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, I have a lot of options. White's Queen on f6 is a major threat. I need to consider moves that defend against that.

*   **h7h6, h7h5:** These pawn moves don't seem to do much to address the immediate threat.
*   **g7g6, g7g5:** Similar to the h-pawn moves, these don't seem to help.
*   **f7f6, f7f5:** These pawn moves are also not very helpful.
*   **b7b6, b7b5, a7a6, a7a5:** These pawn moves don't seem to address the immediate threat.
*   **e7f6, e7e6, e7g5, e7h4:** These are Queen moves. e7f6 is a possible defense, but it allows White to capture the Queen with their Queen. e7e6 seems like a decent defensive move.
*   **d6c5, d6b4, d6a3, c6d8, c6b8, c6a5, c6d4, c6b4, d5f6, d5b6, d5f4, d5b4, d5e3, d5c3:** These are Bishop and Knight moves. None of these seem to immediately help.
*   **h8g8, h8f8, e8f8, e8d8, a8b8, e8g8:** These are Rook and King moves.

Considering the threats, **e7e6** seems like the most sensible move. It blocks the Queen's attack on the King and prepares to develop the Queen.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Okay, I have a lot of options. Let's analyze them.

*   **Pawn moves:** Pushing pawns on the kingside (h7h6 or h7h5) doesn't seem immediately helpful. The same goes for g7g6/g5 and f7f6/f5. Pushing the c-pawn (c7c6 or c7c5) is a possibility to challenge the center. The b-pawn and a-pawn moves are less relevant at this stage.
*   **Knight moves:** The knight on e6 has several options (e6g8, e6g6, e6f6, e6f5, e6g4, e6h3). Moving the knight to f6 (e6f6) looks like a good developing move, challenging the center and potentially preparing to support an advance of the e-pawn.
*   **Bishop moves:** The bishop on e7 has a few moves (e7g8, e7g6, e7c6, e7f5). e7f5 looks interesting, putting pressure on the center and potentially targeting the white queen.
*   **Rook moves:** Rook moves are not relevant at this stage.
*   **King moves:** King moves are not relevant at this stage.
*   **Queen moves:** Queen moves are not relevant at this stage.

Considering the position, I think developing the knight to f6 is a solid developing move. It controls important central squares and prepares for further development.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, I have a lot of options. Let's analyze them:

*   **King moves:** `h8g8`, `e8f8`, `e8d8`, `e8g8` - Moving the king doesn't seem immediately helpful, and could weaken the position further.
*   **Rook moves:** `a8b8`, `h8f8` - These don't seem to improve the position significantly right now.
*   **Pawn moves:** `h7h6`, `g7g6`, `f7f6`, `c7c6`, `b7b6`, `a7a6`, `h7h5`, `f7f5`, `c7c5`, `b7b5`, `a7a5` - These are mostly passive and don't address the threats. Some pawn moves could be useful later for creating space, but not now.
*   **Bishop moves:** `e7g8`, `e7g6`, `e7c6`, `e7f5` - `e7g6` looks interesting, developing the bishop and potentially eyeing the weak f5 square.
*   **Knight moves:** `d6c5`, `d6b4`, `d6a3`, `g5h6`, `g5g6`, `g5f6`, `g5h5`, `g5f5`, `g5h4`, `g5g4`, `g5f4`, `g5g3`, `g5g2`, `d5f6`, `d5b6`, `d5f4`, `d5b4`, `d5e3`, `d5c3` - The knight moves are numerous. `g5f6` or `g5h4` could be interesting to develop the knight and challenge white's control of the center.
*   **Queen moves:** `e5f4` - This is a good developing move, attacking the pawn on f2.

Considering the threats and the need for development, I think the best move is to develop the bishop and attack the pawn on f2.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, that's a lot of moves. Let's analyze them.

*   **King moves:** `h8g8, h8f8, e8f8, e8d8, e8e7` - The King needs to be protected. `e8f8` looks like a reasonable escape route, but it might be too passive. `e8e7` could be good to get out of the pin.
*   **Rook moves:** `a8b8` - Doesn't help much.
*   **Bishop moves:** `g6f8, g6e7, g6h4, g6f4` - The Bishop on g6 is currently passive. `g6f8` develops it, but doesn't immediately help. `g6e7` is a good developing move.
*   **Queen moves:** `d6f8, d6e7, d6c5, d6b4, d6a3` - The Queen is under attack. `d6e7` gets the Queen out of the pin and develops it.
*   **Knight moves:** `g5d8, g5e7, g5h6, g5f6, g5h5, g5f5, g5h4, g5g4, g5f4, g5g3, g5g2` - The Knight on g5 is well-placed, but under attack. `g5e7` develops the Knight.
*   **Pawn moves:** `h7h6, f7f6, c7c6, b7b6, a7a6, h7h5, f7f5, c7c5, b7b5, a7a5` - These moves are mostly defensive.

Considering the threats and my need to develop, I think the best move is to develop the Queen and get it out of the pin. I'll move the Queen to e7.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Okay, I have a lot of options. Let's analyze a bit. White's Queen on h2 is a threat, and I need to address that. I also need to develop my pieces.

*   **h7h6** or **h7h5**: These pawn moves don't immediately address the Queen and don't develop a piece.
*   **g5h6, g5f6, g5h5, g5f5, g5h4, g5f4, g5g4, g5g3, g5e3, g5g2, g5d2**: These are all knight moves. Some look interesting, but I need to prioritize the Queen threat.
*   **e7f8, e7d8, e7f6, e7d6, e7c5, e7b4, e7a3**: These are Bishop moves. Some of these could be good for development, but again, the Queen is the priority.
*   **d5f6, d5b6, d5f4, d5b4, d5e3, d5c3**: These are knight moves.
*   **a7a6, a7a5, b7b6, b7b5, c7c6, c7c5, d7d6, f7f6, f7f5**: These are pawn moves.
*   **h8g8, h8f8, e8f8, e8d8, a8b8**: These are rook and king moves.

The most pressing issue is the Queen on h2. I need to develop a piece to attack it or block its path. The knight on g6 can move to f4, attacking the queen.

Therefore, I will move my knight from g6 to f4.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, that's a lot to consider. White's queen is a threat, and I need to develop my pieces and defend. Let's analyze some options:

*   **Developing moves:** `g8h8` or `g8f8` are options to develop the rook, but they don't immediately address the threat. `f6e7` develops the knight, but doesn't seem to help much.
*   **Pawn moves:** `h7h6` seems passive. `g7g6` is a possibility, but weakens the kingside. `d7d6`, `c7c6`, `b7b6`, `a7a6` are all possible pawn moves, but don't seem urgent. `h7h5` is interesting, challenging the white pawn on g4, but leaves the h-file open.
*   **Knight moves:** `f6d8` is a possibility, but doesn't seem to improve the position.
*   **Other knight moves:** `g5h6`, `g5g6`, `g5h5`, `g5f5`, `g5h4`, `g5g4`, `g5g3`, `g5g2` are all knight moves. `g5h6` seems like a good developing move, challenging the white knight.

I think the best move here is to develop the knight to h6, challenging the white knight and preparing to defend the kingside.

The king has several escape routes. Let's consider them.

*   **e8f8, e8d8:** Moving the king to f8 or d8 looks safe.
*   **e8e7:** This also looks safe.

I'll choose to move the king to a safe square. I'll move the king to d8.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, I've got a list of legal moves. The most pressing issue is the threat to my king. The queen on g7 is a major problem. I need to find a move that addresses this.

*   **g8h8, g8f8, g8e8:** Moving the rook doesn't directly address the immediate threat.
*   **g8g7:** Capturing the queen with the rook is tempting, but it leaves my king even more exposed.
*   **d8e8, d8e7:** Moving the queen doesn't seem to help much.
*   **a8b8:** Moving the rook doesn't help.
*   **h6f8, h6g7, h6h5, h6g5, h6h4, h6f4:** Moving the bishop doesn't seem to help much.
*   **f6h8, f6g7, f6e7, f6g5, f6h4:** Moving the bishop doesn't seem to help much.
*   **e5f4, e5d4:** Moving the pawn doesn't help.
*   **d7d6, c7c6, b7b6, a7a6, g6g5:** These pawn moves are slow and don't address the immediate threat.
*   **d7d5, c7c5, b7b5:** These pawn moves are also slow and don't address the immediate threat.

The best move seems to be to try and defend the king while developing a piece. I will move the pawn in front of the king.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, that's a lot of possible moves. Let's analyze them:

*   **King moves:** `g8h8, g8f8, g8e8, g8g7` - Moving the King is risky right now, given the open files and White's attack. I'll avoid these for now.
*   **Queen moves:** `d8e8, d8e7, d8d7` - The Queen is a key defender. `d8e7` looks like a good option to protect the King and potentially develop.
*   **Bishop moves:** `c8d7, c8e6, c8f5, c8g4, c8h3` - The Bishop on c8 has a lot of options. `c8e6` could be interesting to control the center.
*   **Rook moves:** `a8b8` - Not a priority right now.
*   **Pawn moves:** `h6f8, h6g7, h6h5, h6g5, h6h4, h6f4, f6h8, f6g7, f6e7, f6g5, f6h4, e5f4, e5d4, c7c6, b7b6, a7a6, g6g5, d6d5, c7c5, b7b5` - There are many pawn moves. `h6h5` could help against the Queen, but it also weakens the pawn structure. `c7c5` challenges the center.

Considering the threats and the need to develop, I'm leaning towards `d8e7` to protect the King and develop the Queen.

Okay, I have a lot of options. The immediate threat is the white queen on h8. I can move my queen to h8, but that seems passive. I could also try to develop my pieces and attack.

Let's look at the options that attack the white queen.

*   **...Qh8:** This blocks the check, but it's passive.
*   **...Bg7:** This develops the bishop and attacks the queen.

I think **...Bg7** is the best move. It develops a piece, attacks the queen, and forces White to react.

*   **Bishop Moves:** The bishop on f8 has some options, but none are immediately impactful.
*   **Pawn Moves:** There are several pawn moves.
    *   **...g7g5:** This attacks the knight on f5 and opens the h-file, which could be useful later.
    *   **...b7b6:** This supports the pawn structure.
    *   **...c7c6:** This supports the pawn structure.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Okay, I have a list of legal moves. White is threatening a checkmate. My queen is under attack. I need to defend the king and develop a piece.

Let's analyze the options:

*   **Queen moves:** The queen can move to several squares, but none of them seem to immediately solve the problem.
*   **Rook moves:** Moving the rook doesn't seem to help the immediate situation.
*   **Pawn moves:** Pawn moves are limited and don't address the threat.
*   **Bishop moves:** The bishop on g4 has some interesting options.

The most critical threat is the potential checkmate. I need to find a move that defends against this.

I will move the pawn from c7 to c5. This blocks the check from the bishop on b2, and opens up the diagonal for the queen to defend the king.

Okay, I see the board. White has a strong attack developing, especially with the queen and bishop on the open file. Black's king is somewhat exposed. I need to find a move that addresses the immediate threats and develops my pieces.

I'll check the legal moves to see my options.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Okay, I have a lot of options. Let's analyze them.

*   **Rook moves:** Moving the rooks doesn't seem to immediately help the king's safety.
*   **King moves:** The king has no safe moves.
*   **Queen moves:** The queen has some interesting options, but I need to be careful not to blunder it.
*   **Bishop moves:** The bishop on f8 has several options.
*   **Pawn moves:** Pawn moves can help control the center or protect the king.

The most pressing issue is the potential attack on the king. I think I need to develop a piece to defend the king and potentially counterattack. The bishop on f8 seems like the best option. Moving it to g7 seems like a good defensive move, guarding the h8 square and potentially opening the diagonal for future development.

Okay, I've reviewed the legal moves. White is threatening mate. I need to find a move that defends against the immediate threats and potentially creates some counterplay.

The Queen on h8 is a major threat. I can't ignore it. I see a few options:

*   **...g7f6:** This blocks the Queen's attack on the King and develops the Bishop.
*   **...g7f8:** This moves the Bishop to safety.
*   **...f7f6:** This defends the King and prepares to develop the pawn.

Given the immediate threat, I believe the best move is to block the Queen's attack with the Bishop.

Alright, that's a lot of moves. White's threats are serious. My king is exposed. I need to prioritize defense.

*   **g8h8, g8f8, g8e8, g8d8, g8c8, g8b8:** Moving the rook on g8 doesn't seem to help much immediately.
*   **g8g7, g8g6:** Developing the rook to g6 or g7 could be useful later, but doesn't address the immediate threats.
*   **a8f8, a8e8, a8d8, a8c8, a8b8:** Moving the rook on a8 is also not a priority right now.
*   **e7f8, e7e8, e7d8:** Moving the pawn on e7 doesn't help.
*   **e7d7, e7e6, e7d6:** These pawn moves don't seem to improve the position.
*   **h6f8, h6g7, h6g6, h6h5:** The knight on h6 has some potential, but it's not the most pressing issue.
*   **f6h8, f6g7:** The bishop on f6 has some potential, but it's not the most pressing issue.
*   **g4c8, g4d7, g4e6, g4h5, g4f5, g4h3, g4f3:** The bishop on g4 is important, but moving it now doesn't seem to help.
*   **g5h4:** Moving the pawn on g5 doesn't help.
*   **e5d4:** Moving the pawn on e5 doesn't help.
*   **d5e4:** Moving the pawn on d5 doesn't help.
*   **c5d4:** Moving the pawn on c5 doesn't help.
*   **b7b6, a7a6:** These pawn moves are passive and don't address the threats.
*   **c5c4:** This pawn move might open the c-file, but it doesn't address the immediate danger.
*   **b7b5:** This pawn move is also passive.

Looking at the position again, I think I need to try to activate my bishop on f6 to defend the king and potentially create counterplay. The move **f6g7** seems like the most promising option. It develops the bishop, defends the king, and potentially opens lines for the queen.

*   **Bishop moves:** The bishop on g7 has a few options, but none seem to immediately improve my position. The bishop on g4 has more interesting moves, but I need to be careful of the white queen.
*   **Pawn moves:** I have many pawn moves available. Pushing f7-f6 or f7-f5 looks interesting, as it challenges the center. Pushing e7-e6 or e7-e5 is also a possibility.
*   **Queen moves:** There are no queen moves available.
*   **Knight moves:** The knight on h6 has several moves, but none seem immediately critical.
*   **King moves:** The king is not in immediate danger, so I don't need to move it.

Considering the position, I think the most active move is to challenge the center and open the f-file. I'll play **f7f5**. This attacks the center and prepares for a possible attack on the white king.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, I've got a lot of options. White's queen is a major threat, and I need to find a way to either defend against it or develop my pieces to counterattack.

Let's analyze some of the key moves:

*   **...g8h8/g8f8/g8e8/g8d8/g8c8/g8b8:** Moving the rook doesn't seem to help much right now.
*   **...g8g7/g8g6:** These moves look passive.
*   **...a8f8/a8e8/a8d8/a8c8/a8b8:** Similar to the other rook moves, not immediately helpful.
*   **...e7f8/e7e8/e7d8:** Moving the king is risky, and doesn't address the immediate threats.
*   **...e7f7/e7d7/e7e6:** These moves don't seem to improve the position.
*   **...h6f8/h6g7/h6g6/h6h5:** The knight moves are interesting. ...Ng7 could be a developing move, but doesn't immediately help. ...Nh5 could attack the queen, but it's easily defended.
*   **...f6h8/f6g7/f6e5:** The bishop moves are interesting. ...Bg7 is a developing move, but doesn't immediately help. ...Be5 could attack the knight, but it's easily defended.
*   **...g4h5/g4h3/g4f3:** The pawn moves are not helpful.
*   **...b7a6/b7b6/b7b5:** These pawn moves don't seem to improve the position.
*   **...g5h4:** This pawn move doesn't seem to improve the position.
*   **...f5e4:** This pawn move doesn't seem to improve the position.
*   **...d5e4/d5d4:** These pawn moves don't seem to improve the position.
*   **...c5c4:** This pawn move doesn't seem to improve the position.
*   **...f5f4:** This pawn move doesn't seem to improve the position.

Considering the threats and the need for development, I think the best move is to develop my knight to g7. This move doesn't immediately solve all my problems, but it develops a piece, prepares to defend the king, and potentially opens lines for my queen.

*   **... g7g6:** This move defends the king.
*   **... b7b6:** This move supports the pawn structure.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, that's a lot of moves to consider. Let's break this down.

*   **Immediate Threats:** White's queen on g6 is a potential threat, and the rook on a8 is currently undefended.
*   **Development:** I need to develop my pieces. The bishop on f8 and the rook on a8 are currently passive.
*   **King Safety:** My king is relatively safe for now, but I need to be mindful of potential attacks.
*   **Tactical Considerations:** I see a few potential tactical ideas, like attacking the white queen.

Considering all of this, I think the best move is to develop the rook and put pressure on the h-file.

Alright, I have a list of legal moves. White is clearly trying to attack on the kingside. I need to defend and develop.

*   **h8g8, h8f8, h8e8, h8d8, h8c8, h8b8, h8a8:** Moving the rook doesn't seem to help much immediately.
*   **g7g8, g7f7, g7g6:** Moving the pawn doesn't seem to help much immediately.
*   **e7f8, e7e8, e7d8:** Moving the pawn doesn't seem to help much immediately.
*   **e7f7, e7d7, e7e6:** Moving the pawn doesn't seem to help much immediately.
*   **h6g6, h6h5:** Moving the pawn doesn't seem to help much immediately.
*   **f6e5:** This looks interesting. It opens the diagonal for the bishop and challenges the white pawn.
*   **g4h5, g4h3, g4f3:** Moving the pawn doesn't seem to help much immediately.
*   **b7a6, b7b6, b7b5:** Moving the pawn doesn't seem to help much immediately.
*   **g5h4, f5e4, d5e4, c5b4, f5f4, d5d4, c5c4:** Moving the pawn doesn't seem to help much immediately.

I think **f6e5** is the best move. It opens the diagonal for the bishop, and challenges the white pawn.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, that's a lot of moves! Let's analyze. White's Queen is a threat, and my King is somewhat exposed. I need to consider both defense and development.

*   **Defensive Considerations:** The most immediate threat is the White Queen. I need to consider moves that address this.
*   **Development:** I should also try to develop my pieces to control the center and prepare for a counterattack.

Looking at the moves, `h8g8` seems like a reasonable defensive move, moving the rook to protect the king. However, it doesn't develop any pieces. `e7e6` looks like a good move, developing a pawn and potentially opening lines for my pieces. `f5e4` looks interesting, attacking the pawn and opening the diagonal for the bishop.

Considering the position, I think developing the pawn to control the center and opening lines is the best approach.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, I have a good number of options. Let's analyze a bit.

*   **Rook moves:** The rook on h8 has a lot of options, but none of them immediately threaten anything.
*   **Pawn moves:** The pawn on g7 can move to g6 or g5. The pawn on h6 can move to h5. The pawn on e6 can move to e7 or d7. The pawn on b7 can move to b6 or b5. The pawn on d5 can move to d4. The pawn on c5 can move to c4.
*   **Bishop moves:** The bishop on e5 has some interesting diagonals.
*   **Knight moves:** The knight on g4 has a few options.
*   **King moves:** The king is currently safe.

The position feels a bit closed. I think I want to develop my pieces and control the center. The pawn on d5 is a bit of a weakness. I think I'll try to put pressure on it. I'll move the bishop on e5 to d6 to attack the pawn on d5.

*   **Knight moves:** The knight on g4 has several options, but none seem particularly strong.
*   **Bishop moves:** The bishop on d6 has several options, but none immediately threaten anything.
*   **King moves:** The king is safe for now.

Considering the position, I think I should develop my pawn structure and try to control the center. The pawn on d5 looks like a good candidate to advance.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, I've got a lot of options. Let's analyze them.

*   **Rook moves (h8...):** Moving the rook doesn't immediately solve any problems.
*   **Pawn moves (g7g8, g7f7, etc.):** Pushing the g-pawn doesn't seem to help much.
*   **Bishop moves (d6...):** The bishop on d6 has some interesting options. Moving it to e7 could defend the king, but it might be passive. Moving it to f4 or e5 could be more active, but also more risky.
*   **Knight moves (f5...):** The knight on f5 has a few options, but none seem particularly strong.
*   **Pawn moves (g4...):** The pawn on g4 has some options, but none seem particularly strong.
*   **Pawn moves (b7...):** The b pawn moves don't seem to help much.
*   **Pawn moves (g5...):** The pawn on g5 has some options, but none seem particularly strong.
*   **Pawn moves (c5...):** The c pawn moves don't seem to help much.
*   **Pawn moves (d4...):** The d pawn moves don't seem to help much.

Considering the position, I think the most important thing is to try and activate my pieces and defend against the immediate threats. The bishop on d6 is key. Moving it to **d6e5** seems like a good developing move that also puts some pressure on the center and potentially defends against some threats.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, that's a lot of moves. Let's analyze them.

*   **Rook moves (h8):** The rook on h8 has a lot of options, but moving it doesn't seem to immediately help the king.
*   **Pawn moves (g6, f5, b7, g5, d4, c5):**
    *   `g6g7` and `g6g8` are not good.
    *   `f5e6` doesn't seem to help.
    *   `b7a6` or `b7b6` are passive.
    *   `g5h4`, `g5f4` are not good.
    *   `d4c3`, `d4d3` are not good.
    *   `c5c4` seems interesting, it attacks the center.
*   **Bishop moves (e5):**
    *   `e5f6` attacks the knight.
    *   `e5d6` attacks the pawn.
    *   `e5f4` attacks the pawn.
*   **Knight moves (g4):**
    *   `g4h5`, `g4h3`, `g4f3`, `g4e2`, `g4d1` are not good.

Considering the position, I think the best move is to develop the bishop to f6, attacking the knight and potentially opening lines for attack.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Okay, I've got a lot of options. Let's analyze them.

*   **Rook moves (h8):** Moving the rook doesn't seem to address any immediate threats and doesn't develop anything useful.
*   **Pawn moves (g6, f5, b7, c5, d4):**
    *   `g6g8` is illegal.
    *   `g6g7` is a possibility, but doesn't immediately help.
    *   `f5e6` and `f5e4` are interesting, but could weaken the pawn structure.
    *   `b7a6` and `b7b6` are standard pawn moves, but don't address the immediate threats.
    *   `c5c4` is a possibility, but doesn't immediately help.
    *   `d4d3` is a possibility, but doesn't immediately help.
*   **Bishop moves (f6):**
    *   `f6d8` is a possibility, but doesn't immediately help.
    *   `f6g7` is a possibility, but doesn't immediately help.
    *   `f6e7` is a possibility, but doesn't immediately help.
    *   `f6e5` seems like a good developing move, attacking the knight.
*   **Knight moves (g4):**
    *   `g4h5`, `g4h3`, `g4f3`, `g4e2`, `g4d1` are all possible, but don't seem to address the immediate threats.
*   **Pawn moves (h6):**
    *   `h6f8`, `h6g7`, `h6h5` are all possible, but don't seem to address the immediate threats.

The most promising move seems to be `f6e5`. This develops the bishop, attacks the knight, and opens up the diagonal for the queen.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, I've reviewed the legal moves. White is threatening to push their pawns and launch a strong attack. I need to be careful.

*   **h8g8, h8f8, h8e8, h8d8, h8c8, h8b8, h8a8:** Moving the rook doesn't seem to help much right now.
*   **h6f8, h6g7, h6h5:** Moving the pawn on h6 doesn't seem to help much right now.
*   **g6g8, g6g7, g6f6, g6e6, g6d6, g6c6, g6b6, g6a6:** Moving the pawn on g6 doesn't seem to help much right now.
*   **f5e6, f5e4:** Moving the bishop is interesting, but it doesn't seem to address the immediate threats.
*   **e5b8, e5g7, e5c7, e5f6, e5d6, e5f4:** Moving the bishop is interesting, but it doesn't seem to address the immediate threats.
*   **g4h3, g5h4, g5f4:** Moving the pawn on g4 or g5 doesn't seem to help much right now.
*   **b7a6, b7b6:** Moving the pawn on b7 doesn't seem to help much right now.
*   **c5c4:** This pawn push looks promising. It challenges white's control of the center and opens the diagonal for the bishop on f5.
*   **d4d3:** This pawn push looks promising. It challenges white's control of the center.

I think **c5c4** is the best move. It challenges white's center and opens the diagonal for my bishop.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, I've got a list of legal moves. Let's analyze them.

*   **Rook moves (h8g8, h8f8, etc.):** These don't seem to immediately address the threats.
*   **Pawn moves (g7g8, g7f7, etc.):** Pushing the g-pawn doesn't help much.
*   **Knight moves (h6g6, h6f6, etc.):** The knight on h6 is somewhat awkwardly placed. Moving it doesn't seem to improve the situation significantly.
*   **Bishop moves (f5g6, f5e6, f5e4):** The bishop on f5 is a key defender. Moving it away from the defense of the king is risky.
*   **Queen moves (e5b8, e5c7, etc.):** The queen is well-placed, but moving it might expose the king.
*   **Pawn moves (g4h3, b7a6, g5h4, g5f4, b7b6, d4d3, c4c3):** These pawn moves don't seem to help the immediate situation.

Considering the threats and the need to defend my king, the best move seems to be to develop the knight and defend the king.

I'll move the knight from h6 to f6, defending the king and potentially preparing for future counterplay.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

That's a lot of moves! Let's analyze the position. White's queen is a threat, and I need to be careful. My king is somewhat exposed. I see a few options.

*   **...Bg6** This attacks the white queen and develops a piece.
*   **...Bf4** This attacks the white queen and develops a piece.
*   **...h6** This prevents a potential white rook lift to h7.
*   **...g6** This supports the f5 bishop.

I think ...Bg6 is the most active move, forcing White to react.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, I've got a lot of options. Let's analyze them.

*   **Pawn moves:** h7h6, b7b6, d4d3, c4c3, g5h4, g5f4, h7h5. These are mostly defensive, but some might open lines for the attack.
*   **Knight moves:** g4h5, g4h3, g4f3, g4e2, g4d1, e5b8, e5c7, e5d6, e5f4. The knight on g4 is important to develop and defend the king.
*   **Bishop moves:** f5g6, f5e6, f5f4, f5e4, f5d3, f5c2, f5b1. The bishop on f5 is a key defender.
*   **Rook moves:** h8g8, h8f8, h8e8, h8d8, h8c8, h8b8, h8a8. The rook on h8 is currently passive.
*   **Pawn captures:** g7g6, g7f7, g7e7, g7d7, g7c7, f6f8, f6d8, f6f7, f6e7, f6h6, f6g6, f6e6, f6d6, f6c6, f6b6, f6a6, f5g6, f5e6.

The most pressing issue is the attack on the king. White's queen and rook are aiming at the kingside. I need to develop my pieces to defend.

The knight on g4 seems like the most active piece. Moving it to f6 would block the attack and develop the knight.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

You are absolutely right! I made a mistake. The knight on g4 is pinned by the white bishop on c1. I need to find another move.

Let's re-evaluate. The immediate threat is the attack on the king. The knight on e5 is also under attack.

*   **Knight moves:** e5b8, e5c7, e5d6, e5f4.
*   **Bishop moves:** f5g6, f5e6, f5f4, f5e4, f5d3, f5c2, f5b1.
*   **Rook moves:** h8g8, h8f8, h8e8, h8d8, h8c8, h8b8, h8a8.
*   **Pawn moves:** h7h6, b7b6, d4d3, c4c3, g5h4, g5f4, h7h5.

Moving the knight on e5 to f4 seems like a good option. It attacks the white bishop on g2 and defends the king.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, I have a lot of options. The position is complex. Let's break it down.

*   **Rook moves:** The rook on h8 has a lot of options, but they don't seem immediately impactful.
*   **Pawn moves:** The pawn on g7 can advance, but it's not immediately threatening. The pawn on h7 can move, but it doesn't seem to help much.
*   **Bishop moves:** The bishop on f6 has a lot of diagonals to choose from.
*   **Pawn moves:** The pawn on g5 can move.
*   **Bishop moves:** The bishop on f4 has a lot of diagonals to choose from.
*   **Pawn moves:** The pawn on b7 can move.
*   **Pawn moves:** The pawn on d4 can move.
*   **Pawn moves:** The pawn on c4 can move.

I need to consider the threats and my opponent's likely plans. White's king is exposed. I need to find a move that either develops my pieces, attacks the king, or defends against any immediate threats.

The bishop on f4 looks interesting. It can attack the king. Let's see if I can exploit that.

I'll move the bishop on f4 to e3, attacking the white king.

You are a professional chess player and you play as black. Now is your turn to make a move. Before making a move you can pick one of the following actions:
- 'get_current_board' to get the schema and current status of the board
- 'get_legal_moves' to get a UCI formatted list of available moves
- 'make_move <UCI formatted move>' when you are ready to complete your turn (e.g., 'make_move e2e4')

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, I have a good number of options. Let's consider a few.

*   **...d7-d5:** This is a standard and solid move, challenging the center. It opens lines for the queen and bishop.
*   **...e8-e7:** This prepares for castling.
*   **...g7-g6:** This is a more passive move, but it can help control the kingside and prepare for a later ...Bg7.
*   **...b7-b6:** This can prepare for ...Bb7, putting pressure on the long diagonal.

I think I like the idea of challenging the center and opening lines for my pieces. I'll play ...d7-d5.

Alright, I have a lot of options. White has developed their e and d pawns, so I need to be careful. I see a few possibilities:

*   **...Nf6:** This is a standard developing move, controlling central squares and preparing for further development.
*   **...Be7:** This develops the bishop to a good square, eyeing the kingside.
*   **...d6:** This supports the e5 pawn and prepares for ...e4.

I think ...Nf6 is a solid, flexible move. Let's go with that.

Alright, I've got a lot of options. Let's analyze this. White has a strong center and a well-developed position. Black needs to develop and challenge White's control.

The pawn moves like g7g6, b7b6, a7a6, h6h5, g7g5, b7b5, a7a5 are all solid, but don't immediately address the central tension.

Moving the queen's bishop, f8e7, f8d6 are interesting. Developing the knight with b8c6 or b8d7 is also good.

I like the idea of developing the knight to c6. It attacks the center and prepares to challenge white's control.

Therefore, I will move the knight from b8 to c6.

*   **Pawn moves:** `h8h7`, `g7g6`, `g7g5`, `b7b6`, `b7b5`, `a7a6`, `a7a5`, `h6h5`, `e5e4`, `d5d4`. These are mostly pawn moves. Pushing the h-pawn doesn't seem to achieve much. The other pawn moves are more interesting. `g7g6` and `g7g5` could be useful to challenge white's control of the center. `b7b6` and `b7b5` are standard pawn moves. `e5e4` would open the position and could be interesting.
*   **Knight moves:** `f6g8`, `f6h7`, `f6d7`, `f6h5`, `f6e4`, `c6b8`, `c6e7`, `c6a5`, `c6d4`, `c6b4`. The knight on f6 has several options. `f6e4` looks interesting, attacking the pawn on d2 and opening lines. `f6d7` is a developing move. The knight on c6 also has several options.
*   **Bishop moves:** `f8e7`, `f8d6`, `g4c8`, `g4d7`, `g4e6`, `g4h5`, `g4f5`, `g4h3`, `g4f3`, `g4e2`, `g4d1`. The bishop on f8 has limited options. The bishop on g4 has more options.
*   **Queen moves:** `d8c8`, `d8b8`, `d8e7`, `d8d7`, `d8c7`, `d8d6`, `d8b6`, `d8a5`. The queen has many options, but it's not clear where to place it yet.
*   **Rook moves:** `a8c8`, `a8b8`. The rooks are not yet active.
*   **King moves:** `e8e7`, `e8d7`. The king is safe for now.

I like the look of `f6e4`. It attacks a pawn, opens lines, and develops the knight to a good square. Let's try that.

Okay, that's a lot of moves. Let's analyze the position. White has a strong center, and I need to develop my pieces and challenge that. The queen on d8 has many options, but I don't want to move it too early. The bishop on f8 has some good diagonals. The pawn structure is relatively closed.

I think I'll develop the bishop on f8 to g7. This will control the long diagonal and potentially put pressure on the kingside.

That's a lot of moves! Let's analyze. White's queen is a threat, and I need to develop my pieces and control the center. I see a few promising options:

*   **...Qd7** Develops the queen, defends the king, and potentially eyes the weak pawn on g2.
*   **...Nf6** Develops the knight, controls important central squares, and prepares for further development.
*   **...f6** Supports the pawn structure and prepares to challenge white's control of the center.

I'm leaning towards developing the knight first. It's a solid, developing move.

Okay, that's a lot of moves. White is threatening a lot, especially on the kingside. Let's analyze some key options:

*   **Defensive moves:** I need to prioritize defending my king. Moves like ...h7 or ...e7 look like they might help, but they don't address the immediate threats.
*   **Developing moves:** I could develop my queen's bishop or move my queen, but I need to be careful not to leave my king exposed.
*   **Counterplay:** I could try to create some counterplay, but I need to be careful not to overextend.

After careful consideration, I think the best move is to develop my queen's bishop to a more active square and defend the king.

Okay, that's a lot of moves! Let's analyze the position. White has a strong attack brewing, especially with the queen and bishop on the kingside. Black needs to defend carefully and try to develop some counterplay.

Here's my thinking:

*   **King Safety:** The king is a little exposed. Moves like ...h7 or ...h5 could help.
*   **Development:** Black's pieces are somewhat passive. Developing the knight on f6 is a good idea.
*   **Counterplay:** Black needs to find a way to create threats.

Considering all of this, I'll make a move that improves the king's safety and develops a piece.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Okay, I have a lot of options. White's threats are serious. The most immediate threat seems to be the potential for Qh5, attacking the King and potentially leading to a quick checkmate. I need to address that.

Let's analyze some of the moves:

*   **...e8f8, ...e8d8, ...e8d7**: Moving the King doesn't seem to solve the immediate problems and might make things worse.
*   **...a8d8, ...a8c8, ...a8b8**: Moving the Rook doesn't help the immediate threats.
*   **...h7h8, ...h7g7**: Pawn moves don't address the threats.
*   **...c7d8, ...c7c8, ...c7b8, ...c7e7, ...c7d7, ...c7d6, ...c7b6, ...c7a5**: Queen moves are interesting. ...Qd8 might be a good defensive move, but it doesn't develop a piece. ...Qe7 might be better, developing the Queen to a more active square and defending the King.
*   **...f6h8, ...f6d8, ...f6g7, ...f6e7, ...f6g5, ...f6h4**: Knight moves. ...Ne7 develops the Knight and defends the King.
*   **...c6d8, ...c6b8, ...c6e7, ...c6a5, ...c6b4**: Pawn moves.
*   **...g4h5, ...g4f5, ...g4h3, ...g4f3, ...g4e2**: Knight moves.
*   **...e4d6, ...e4g5, ...e4g3, ...e4c3, ...e4f2, ...e4d2**: Pawn moves.
*   **...e8c8**: King move.
*   **...g6f5**: Pawn move.
*   **...d4e3**: Pawn move.
*   **...b7b6, ...a7a6, ...h6h5, ...g6g5, ...d4d3, ...b7b5, ...a7a5**: Pawn moves.

Considering the threats, I think the best move is to develop the Knight and defend the King.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, that's a lot of moves. White is clearly threatening a checkmate. I need to prioritize defense. Let's analyze a few options:

*   **...Qf8:** This seems like a good defensive move, getting the Queen out of the line of fire and potentially developing it to a more active square later.
*   **...Bf6:** This blocks the immediate threat on the e-file and develops the Bishop.
*   **...h5:** This prevents White from playing g4-g5, which would further expose my King.

I think ...Qf8 is the most solid move here. It removes the Queen from the attack and allows me to evaluate the position after White's response.

Moving the Queen to e7 seems like the most pressing move to get out of the immediate danger.

*   **Queen moves (e7d8, e7d7, e7c7, e7f6, e7e6, e7d6, e7g5, e7h4):** The queen is well-placed. Moving the queen is a good option.
*   **Knight moves (c6d8, c6b8, c6a5, c6d4, c6b4, e4f6, e4d6, e4g5, e4g3, e4c3, e4f2, e4d2):** The knight on c6 is well-placed. The knight on e4 is under attack.
*   **Bishop moves (f8g7):** The bishop on f8 is somewhat passive.
*   **Pawn moves (g4h5, g4f5, g4h3, g4f3, g4e2, a7b6, g6f5, e5d4, c5d4, f7f6, a7a6, h6h5, g6g5, a7a5):** Several pawn moves are available.

The knight on e4 is under attack by my pawn on f7. I should take advantage of this.

I'll move my knight on e4 to d6, attacking the queen.

*   **...e7e6:** This supports the pawn on d6 and helps to control the center.
*   **...d6f5:** This attacks the knight, but it might open up lines for the white queen.
*   **...g4f3:** This attacks the bishop, but it might open up lines for the white queen.
*   **...h7h5:** This is a pawn move that challenges the white attack.

Considering the position, I think developing the bishop is a good start, and I'll play e7e6 to support the pawn on d6.

*   **h7h8, h7g7:** Pawn moves. h7h8 would be a promotion, but it doesn't seem to be the best option right now.
*   **e6c8, e6e7, e6d7, e6f6, e6f5, e6d5, e6c4:** Queen moves. The Queen is well-placed, but moving it now might not be the best use of it.
*   **d6c8, d6f5, d6b5, d6e4, d6c4:** Knight moves. The Knight on d6 has several options.
*   **c6d8, c6b8, c6e7, c6a5, c6d4, c6b4:** Knight moves. The Knight on c6 has several options.
*   **g4h5, g4f5, g4h3, g4f3, g4e2:** Knight moves. The Knight on g4 has several options.
*   **a7b6, g6f5, e5d4, c5d4, f7f6, a7a6, h6h5, g6g5, e5e4, a7a5:** Pawn moves.

The position is complex. I want to develop my pieces and control the center. The Knight on d6 looks like a good candidate for a move. I'll move the knight to f5 to attack the center and potentially open lines for my queen.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, that's a lot of moves to consider! Let's break this down.

*   **Immediate Threats:** White's queen on d4 is a potential threat. I need to be mindful of that.
*   **My Plan:** I want to develop my pieces, control the center, and put pressure on White's king.

Considering the available moves, I like the idea of developing my dark-squared bishop to a more active square. Specifically, ...Bg7 looks good. It develops the bishop, eyes the kingside, and potentially supports a later kingside attack.

So, I'll make the move ...Bg7.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, that's a lot to consider. Let's break this down. White seems to be targeting the kingside. I need to improve the king's safety and develop my pieces.

*   **King Safety:** Moving the rook from a8 to d8 or c8 doesn't seem to help much in the immediate future.
*   **Development:** The knight on g4 is a bit passive. Moving the knight on c6 seems more promising.
*   **Immediate Threats:** There aren't any immediate checkmates, but white has a strong attack.

Considering all of this, I think the best move is to develop the knight and challenge the center.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, that's a lot of moves. Let's analyze the most critical ones.

*   **e8f8, e8d8, e8e7:** Moving the king doesn't seem to help much, as it just shuffles the king around.
*   **g7f6, g7f8, g7h8:** Moving the bishop is a possibility. Bf6 could be a good defensive move, developing the bishop and potentially blocking some attacks.
*   **e6c8, e6e7, e6d7, e6f6, e6d6, e6c6, e6b6, e6d5, e6c4:** The queen is under pressure. Moving the queen is important. Qc6 looks like a good developing move, attacking a pawn and getting out of the line of fire.
*   **f5e7, f5d6, f5h4, f5g3, f5e3:** The knight is also under pressure.
*   **g4h5, g4h3, g4f3, g4e2:** The knight is under pressure.
*   **d4c6, d4b5, d4f3, d4b3, d4e2, d4c2:** The pawn is under pressure.
*   **a7b6, f7f6, a7a6, h6h5, g6g5, e5e4, a7a5:** These are pawn moves.

Considering the position, I think the best move is to develop the queen to a safe square and attack a pawn.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Okay, I have a lot of options. Let's analyze a few of the most interesting ones:

*   **...Qc7:** This develops the queen to a more active square, puts pressure on the c-file, and prepares to support a pawn advance.
*   **...Nf6:** This develops the knight, challenges White's knight on f4, and controls important central squares.
*   **...f6:** This supports the pawn on e5 and prepares to challenge White's control of the center.
*   **...g6:** This prepares to fianchetto the bishop on g7.

I think ...Nf6 is the most principled move. It develops a piece to a good square, challenges White's central control, and prepares for further development.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

That's a lot of moves! Let's analyze the position and narrow down the options.

*   **King moves:** e8f8, e8d8, e8e7. The king is somewhat restricted, but these moves are safe for now.
*   **Rook moves:** a8d8, a8c8, a8b8. The rook on a8 has a few options.
*   **Pawn moves:** h7h8, h7g7, g6g5, e5e4, a7b6, a7a6, a7a5. Pawn moves are important for controlling the center and creating space.
*   **Knight moves:** f6h8, f6d8, f6g7, f6e7, f6g5, f6h4, g4h5, g4h3, g4f3, g4e2. The knights have good mobility.
*   **Queen moves:** c6c8, c6d7, c6c7, c6e6, c6d6, c6b6, c6d5, c6b5, c6e4, c6a4, c6f3, c6g2. The queen is well-placed, and has many options.
*   **Bishop moves:** f5g7, f5e7, f5d6, f5h4, f5g3, f5e3. The bishop on f5 has a good diagonal.

Looking at the position, I think a good developing move is to move the queen to a more active square. The move **Qc6-d5** looks promising. It attacks the pawn on e5, puts pressure on the center, and opens up the diagonal for the bishop on f5.

Okay, I see the board. White has a strong attack developing with the queen and knight. My king is a little exposed. I need to be careful. Let's see what my legal moves are.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, that's a lot to consider. White's queen on d4 is a major threat. I need to address that.

*   **d5e4** looks interesting. It attacks the queen and opens the diagonal for my bishop. However, it leaves my pawn on e5 undefended.
*   **d5c4** also attacks the queen.
*   **f6g5** develops my knight and attacks the bishop on g5.
*   **e8e7** is a defensive move, but it doesn't really address the immediate threats.

I think I'll go with **d5c4**. It forces White to react to the attack on their queen.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, I've got a lot of options. Let's break this down.

*   **King moves:** `e8f8`, `e8d8`, `e8e7` - Moving the king is tempting, but it's probably not the best idea right now. I need to develop my pieces and try to counter-attack.
*   **Rook moves:** `a8d8`, `a8c8`, `a8b8`, `h7h8`, `h7g7` - The rooks are important, but I don't see an immediate need to move them.
*   **Knight moves:** `f6h8`, `f6d8`, `f6g7`, `f6e7`, `f6g5`, `f6h4`, `g4h5`, `g4h3`, `g4f3`, `g4e2` - The knights are active, but I need to be careful.
*   **Pawn moves:** `f5g7`, `f5e7`, `f5d6`, `f5h4`, `f5g3`, `f5e3`, `d4e6`, `d4c6`, `d4b5`, `d4f3`, `d4b3`, `d4e2`, `d4c2`, `a7b6`, `a7a6`, `h6h5`, `g6g5`, `e5e4`, `a7a5` - Pawn moves are important for controlling the center and supporting my pieces.
*   **Bishop moves:** - I don't have any bishop moves available.
*   **Queen moves:** - I don't have any queen moves available.

Considering the position, I think I should try to develop my knight and put some pressure on the center. I'll move my knight from g4 to e2. This attacks the white bishop on f1.

I'm going to focus on developing a piece and challenging the center. The move ...f6e7 looks like a good developing move, getting the knight off the back rank and potentially supporting a pawn advance later.

Alright, I have a lot of options. Let's analyze a bit.

*   **King moves:** e8f8, e8d8, e8d7 - These seem passive.
*   **Pawn moves:** h7h8, h7g7, f7f6, b7b6, a7a6, h6h5, g6g5, e5e4, b7b5, a7a5 - Pawn moves are generally good for controlling space and developing.
*   **Bishop moves:** e7f8, e7d8, e7f6, e7d6, e7g5, e7h4 - The bishop on e7 has a lot of diagonals.
*   **Knight moves:** f5g7, f5d6, f5h4, f5g3, f5e3 - The knight on f5 is well-placed.
*   **Other moves:** d4e6, d4c6, d4b5, d4f3, d4b3, d4c2, e2h5, e2g4, e2c4, e2f3, e2d3, e2f1, e2d1 - These are white's moves, so I can ignore them.

The knight on f5 looks like a good piece to develop. I'm going to move it to d6, attacking the center.

Okay, I see the board. Black's king is on e8. White has a strong attack developing. I need to find a move that improves my position and defends against immediate threats. Let's see what moves are available.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Okay, I've got a lot of options. White is threatening a lot, and I need to be careful. Let's analyze some of the more interesting moves:

*   **...Bf8:** This develops the bishop and defends the h6 pawn.
*   **...e7:** This blocks the diagonal of the white bishop on f1.
*   **...g5:** This challenges white's control of the center.
*   **...f5:** This attacks the white knight on d4.

I think the most important thing is to develop my pieces and defend against the immediate threats. I'll go with ...Bf8.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Okay, I have a lot of options. Let's analyze the position. White's king is exposed, and I have a bishop on f8 that could potentially target it. I also have a bishop on f5 that is well-placed. I need to consider the immediate threats and the long-term plan.

*   **f8g7:** This develops the bishop and attacks the h6 pawn. It also opens a diagonal towards the white king.
*   **f5g7:** This is also a good developing move, but it blocks the bishop on f8.
*   **f6g7:** This develops the knight and attacks the h6 pawn.
*   **h7h8:** This is a pawn promotion, but it doesn't seem immediately useful.
*   **e5e4:** This challenges the center.

Considering the position, I think developing the bishop on f8 is the most active move. It immediately puts pressure on the kingside.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, I have a lot of options. White is threatening a lot, especially with the Queen. I need to be careful. Let's analyze a few possibilities:

*   **Defensive moves:**
    *   `e7f6`: This defends the pawn on f7, but it doesn't develop a piece.
    *   `e7d6`: This also defends the pawn on f7, and develops the bishop.
    *   `f7f6`: This defends the pawn on f7, but it doesn't develop a piece.
*   **Developing moves:**
    *   `g6g5`: This challenges White's control of the center.
    *   `b7b5`: This challenges White's control of the center.
    *   `a7a5`: This challenges White's control of the center.
    *   `e7d6`: This develops the bishop.

I think developing the bishop to d6 is a good move. It defends the pawn on f7, and it opens up the diagonal for the bishop. It also prepares to challenge White's control of the center.

*   **Pawn moves:** Many pawn moves are available, but most don't immediately address the threats. h7h8, g7h8, g7g8, g7f8, g7f6, d6f8, d6e7, d6c7, d4e6, d4c6, d4f5, d4b5, d4f3, d4b3, d4c2, e3f5, e3d5, e3g4, e3c4, e3g2, e3c2, e3f1, e3d1, e2h5, e2g4, e2c4, e2f3, e2d3, e2f1, e2d1, f7e6, f7f6, b7b6, a7a6, h6h5, g6g5, e5e4, f7f5, b7b5, a7a5.

The most important thing is to protect the king. The rook on h8 is a threat. I need to find a move that defends against this.

*   **g7f6**: This move seems to be the most promising. It blocks the rook's attack on the king.

Let's make that move.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Okay, I've got a lot of options. Let's analyze them.

*   **Pawn moves:** `h7h8` is a promotion, but it's not immediately helpful. `h7g7` is a standard pawn move. `f6g7, f6e7, d6f8, d6e7, d6c7, d4e6, d4c6, d4f5, d4b5, d4f3, d4b3, d4c2, e3f5, e3d5, e3g4, e3c4, e3g2, e3c2, e3f1, e3d1, e2h5, e2g4, e2c4, e2f3, e2d3, e2f1, e2d1, f7e6, b7b6, a7a6, h6h5, g6g5, e5e4, b7b5, a7a5` are all pawn moves. Some of these are good for development, some are for defense.

*   **Knight moves:** The knights are important for defense. `d4e6` seems interesting, attacking the bishop.

*   **Bishop moves:** The bishop on d4 has a lot of options.

*   **Queen moves:** The queen is not on the board.

*   **Rook moves:** The rooks are not on the board.

*   **King moves:** The king is not on the board.

I think the most important thing right now is to develop my pieces and try to control the center. The knight on d4 looks good. I will move the knight to c6, controlling a key square and potentially putting pressure on white's center.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, I've got a lot of options. Let's analyze them.

*   **Pawn moves:** h7h8, h7g7, f6g7, f6e7, d6f8, d6e7, d6c7, c6d8, c6b8, c6e7, c6a5, c6d4, c6b4, f7e6, b7b6, a7a6, h6h5, g6g5, e5e4, b7b5, a7a5. There are many pawn moves available.

*   **Knight moves:** e3f5, e3d5, e3g4, e3c4, e3g2, e3c2, e3f1, e3d1, e2h5, e2g4, e2c4, e2f3, e2d3, e2f1, e2d1. The knights have a lot of mobility.

*   **Queen moves:** None.

*   **Bishop moves:** None.

*   **Rook moves:** None.

*   **King moves:** None.

Considering the board state, I want to develop my pieces and control the center. The knight on c6 looks well-placed, but it's a bit passive. I'll try to activate it.

I'll move the knight on c6 to a more active square, attacking the pawn on d4.

Some of these are good for development, some are defensive, and some are just bad.

*   **Immediate Threats:** White's queen and bishop are eyeing my king. I need to address this.

*   **Priorities:**
    1.  **Defense:** Protect my king.
    2.  **Development:** Develop my pieces to counterattack.

Considering the position, I think I need to move my pawn to protect my king. I will move my pawn from f6 to e7.

Let's analyze some key possibilities:

*   **Pawn moves:** Pushing pawns like h7h5 or g6g5 could challenge white's control of the center and create some space. However, they could also weaken my king's position.
*   **Knight moves:** The knight on d4 is well-placed. Moving it could create threats or defend key squares.
*   **Bishop moves:** The bishop on e3 is a threat. I need to be careful about how I deal with it.
*   **Other moves:** I need to look for any immediate threats and address them.

Considering the position, I think I should try to develop my pieces and control the center. I'll move my knight to a more active square.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, I have a lot of options. Let's analyze them.

*   **Pawn Moves:** `h7h8`, `h7g7`, `f7f6`, `b7b6`, `a7a6`, `h6h5`, `g6g5`, `e5e4`, `b7b5`, `a7a5` These are mostly pawn moves. Pushing the h-pawn to promote is tempting, but likely too slow. Pushing other pawns doesn't seem to help immediately.

*   **Knight Moves:** `f5g7`, `f5h4`, `f5d4`, `f5g3`, `e3d5`, `e3g4`, `e3c4`, `e3g2`, `e3c2`, `e3f1`, `e3d1`, `e2h5`, `e2g4`, `e2c4`, `e2f3`, `e2d3`, `e2f1`, `e2d1` The knight on f5 has some interesting options.

*   **Bishop Moves:** `d6c7`, `e7f8`, `e7d8`, `e7f6` The bishop on d6 has limited options.

*   **Other Moves:**

    *   `f7e6`

Considering the position, I need to defend my king and develop my pieces. The knight on f5 is well-placed. I think I will move the knight to a square where it can defend the king and potentially attack.

I'll move the knight from f5 to h4. This defends against a potential check on g6 and also attacks the white pawn on g2.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, I have the list of legal moves. Let's analyze them.

*   **Pawn moves:** `h7h8, h7g7, h7f7, b7b6, a7a6, h6h5, g6g5, f6f5, e5e4, b7b5, a7a5` - These are mostly developing moves, but some could be useful for defense.
*   **Knight moves:** `e7f8, e7d8, h4f5, h4f3, h4g2, e3f5, e3d5, e3g4, e3c4, e3g2, e3c2, e3f1, e3d1` - The knight moves are interesting, but some of them might not be the best.
*   **Bishop moves:** `d6c7` - This bishop move doesn't seem to help much.
*   **Queen moves:** `e2h5, e2g4, e2c4, e2f3, e2d3, e2f1, e2d1` - Queen moves are powerful, but need to be used carefully.

The most pressing issue is the exposed king. I need to consider moves that address this. The move `e7f8` looks interesting, as it develops the knight and potentially blocks a check. Let's try that.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, I have a lot of options. Let's analyze them.

*   **Attacking the King:** The most immediate threat is the knight on h4. I could move it to f3 or g2, but that doesn't seem to immediately win anything. The bishop on e3 could also attack the king, but it's blocked.
*   **Developing Pieces:** Moving the pawn on h7 to h5 looks like a good developing move, and it opens up a potential attack on the kingside.
*   **Pawn Structure:** The pawn moves on the a, b, f, and g files are all standard pawn moves.

Considering the exposed white king, I think the best move here is to develop my knight and put pressure on the kingside.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Okay, I see the legal moves again. I apologize for the previous error. Let's re-evaluate.

*   **f8g7, f8e7:** Moving the bishop doesn't seem to accomplish much immediately.
*   **h7h8, h7g7, h7f7, h7e7, h7d7, h7c7:** These are all pawn promotions or captures with the pawn on h7. None of them seem particularly strong right now.
*   **d6e7, d6c7:** Moving the bishop on d6. These moves don't seem to create any immediate threats.
*   **h4f5, h4f3, h4g2:** Moving the knight on h4. h4f3 attacks the king, but it's blocked by the pawn on g3. h4g2 doesn't seem to do much.
*   **e3f5, e3d5, e3g4, e3c4, e3g2, e3c2, e3f1, e3d1:** Moving the bishop on e3. These moves don't seem to create any immediate threats.
*   **e2h5, e2g4, e2c4, e2f3, e2d3, e2f1, e2d1:** Moving the bishop on e2. These moves don't seem to create any immediate threats.
*   **c5b4:** This pawn move doesn't seem to help.
*   **b7b6, a7a6:** These pawn moves are standard.
*   **h6h5, g6g5, f6f5, e5e4:** These pawn moves are standard.
*   **b7b5, a7a5:** These pawn moves are standard.

The knight on h4 is the most active piece. Moving it to f3 attacks the king, and while it's blocked by the pawn, it forces White to react. This could open up lines for an attack.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, I've got a lot of options. Let's break this down.

*   **King Safety:** My king is the most vulnerable piece. I need to consider moves that improve its safety.
*   **Development:** I need to develop my pieces to counter White's attack.
*   **Tactics:** Are there any immediate threats or opportunities?

Looking at the moves, I see a few that stand out:

*   **...h7h5:** This pawn move challenges White's control of the g4 square and might help to create some space for my king.
*   **...f6f5:** This pawn move attacks the center and opens the f-file for my rook.
*   **...e5e4:** This pawn move challenges White's control of the center and opens the e-file for my queen.

I think I'll go with **...h7h5**. It's a solid developing move that helps to secure my king.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

You are absolutely right! I misread the board. My h-pawn is already on h6. I apologize for that blunder.

Let's re-evaluate. My king is still the priority.

*   **...f6f5:** This pawn move attacks the center and opens the f-file for my rook. This seems like a good option.
*   **...e5e4:** This pawn move challenges White's control of the center and opens the e-file for my queen. This is also a good option.

I'm going to go with **...f6f5**. It's a more direct challenge to the center and opens a line for my rook.

Alright, I've got a lot of options. White's king is vulnerable, and I want to exploit that. I see a few interesting possibilities.

*   **...Bf8-g7:** This develops the bishop and puts pressure on the kingside.
*   **...h7-h5:** This pawn push can create a potential weakness around the white king.
*   **...g4-f2:** This is a tempting tactic, but it leads to a queen trade and might not be the most effective.
*   **...e5-e4:** This opens the position and attacks the pawn on d4.

I think the most promising approach is to develop my bishop and put pressure on the kingside. Let's go with ...Bf8-g7.

Proxy (to Player_Black):

h7h8,g7h8,g7f8,g7f6,d6f8,d6b8,d6e7,d6c7,g4f6,g4e3,g4h2,g4f2,f3g5,f3h4,f3d4,f3h2,f3d2,f3g1,f3e1,e2c4,e2d3,e2f1,e2d1,b7a6,c5b4,f4g3,b7b6,h6h5,g6g5,e5e4,b7b5

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Okay, I have a lot of options. Let's analyze them:

*   **Pawn moves:** `h7h8`, `g7h8`, `g7f8`, `g7f6`, `d6f8`, `d6b8`, `d6e7`, `d6c7`, `b7a6`, `c5b4`, `h6h5`, `g6g5`, `e5e4`, `b7b6`, `b7b5`. These are mostly defensive, but some could be useful for creating counterplay or defending the king.
*   **Knight moves:** `g4f6`, `g4e3`, `g4h2`, `g4f2`, `f3g5`, `f3h4`, `f3d4`, `f3h2`, `f3d2`, `f3g1`, `f3e1`. The knights are well-placed to attack, but need to be careful of the white pieces.
*   **Bishop moves:** `e2c4`, `e2d3`, `e2f1`, `e2d1`. The bishop on e2 is under attack.

The most pressing issue is the attack on my king. White's queen and rooks are all aimed at the king. I need to find a move that will defend the king, and ideally create some counterplay.

Let's consider the pawn moves first. `g7f6` looks interesting, as it opens a line for the bishop on e2. `h7h8` is also an option, but I don't want to promote the pawn to a queen just yet.

I think the best move is to develop the bishop to defend the king.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, I've got a lot of options. Let's analyze. White has a strong attack, and my king is a little exposed. I need to be careful.

*   **h7h8, g7h8, g7f8, d6f8, d6b8:** These involve promoting a pawn or moving a bishop, but don't seem immediately helpful.
*   **g7f6, d6e7, d6c7, g4f6, g4e3, g4h2, g4f2, f3g5, f3h4, f3d4, f3h2, f3d2, f3g1, f3e1, d3f5, d3e4, d3c4, d3e2, d3c2, d3f1, d3b1:** These are bishop and knight moves. Some of these look like they might help develop my pieces or defend.
*   **b7a6, c5b4, f4g3:** These are pawn moves.
*   **b7b6, h6h5, g6g5, e5e4, b7b5:** These are pawn moves.

I see a few possibilities. The immediate threat is the white queen and rook. I need to develop my pieces and try to counter-attack.

I think the best move here is to develop my knight and attack the white bishop.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, that's a lot of moves to consider! Let's analyze the position. White seems to have a strong attack brewing. My king is somewhat exposed. I need to prioritize defense and development.

*   **Pawn moves:** Pushing pawns like h6h5 or g6g5 doesn't seem to help much. a7a5 and b7b5 are possible, but don't immediately improve the position.
*   **Bishop moves:** The bishops on d6 and f3 have some options, but none seem particularly strong right now.
*   **Knight moves:** The knight on f3 has several moves, but none seem to directly address the immediate threats.
*   **Pawn moves:** e5e4 looks interesting, challenging the center.
*   **Rook moves:** No rook moves are available.

Considering the available moves, I think the most active move is to challenge the center and open the position a bit. I'll play **e5e4**.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Okay, I've reviewed the legal moves. White's attack is a serious concern. I need to address the potential threats to my king.

*   **h7h8=Q, h7h8=R, h7h8=B, h7h8=N:** Promoting the pawn on h7 to a queen, rook, bishop, or knight is not immediately helpful.
*   **h7g7, h7f7, h7e7, h7d7, h7c7:** Moving the h-pawn doesn't seem to improve the position.
*   **f6g7, f6e7, f6g5, f6f5, f6e5:** Moving the knight on f6 doesn't seem to help the defense.
*   **d6f8, d6b8, d6e7, d6c7, d6e5, d6c5:** Moving the bishop on d6 doesn't seem to help.
*   **f3g5, f3e5, f3h4, f3d4, f3h2, f3d2, f3g1, f3e1:** Moving the knight on f3 is not possible as it is a white piece.
*   **e3f5, e3d5, e3g4, e3c4, e3g2, e3c2, e3f1, e3d1:** Moving the bishop on e3 is not possible as it is a white piece.
*   **d3c4, d3e2, d3c2, d3b1:** Moving the bishop on d3 is not possible as it is a white piece.
*   **f4g3:** Moving the pawn on f4 is not possible as it is a white piece.
*   **b7b6, a7a6, h6h5, g6g5, b7b5, a7a5:** Pushing pawns doesn't seem to address the immediate threats.

I'm going to play **h6h5**. This move challenges white's control of the h-file and prepares to potentially develop the rook. It also creates a small shield for the king.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, I've got a lot of options. White is threatening my king, and I need to address that. Looking at the moves, I see a few possibilities.

*   **...h7h6**: This seems like a reasonable defensive move, preventing a potential checkmate threat.
*   **...g6g5**: This could open the g-file for my rook, but it also weakens my pawn structure.
*   **...f6g5**: This attacks the knight, but it also opens the f-file for a potential attack on my king.
*   **...e3g2**: This is a bishop move that seems to be a defensive move.

Considering the threats and the need to consolidate my position, I think **...h7h6** is the most solid move. It blocks a potential check and prepares for further defense.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Okay, I have the legal moves. Let's analyze them:

*   **f6e7:** This moves the pawn, but doesn't seem to address any immediate threats.
*   **f6g5:** This pawn move opens the g-file and could potentially create some attacking chances later, but it doesn't help defend the king.
*   **f6f5:** This pawn move challenges white's control of the center and opens the f-file.
*   **d6e5:** This pawn move opens the position and attacks the bishop.
*   **f3e5:** This is not a legal move.
*   **f3d4:** This is not a legal move.

Considering the position, I think **f6f5** is the best move. It challenges white's control of the center and opens the f-file for potential counterplay.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Okay, I've got a lot of options. Let's analyze a bit.

*   **Pawn moves:** Pushing the h-pawn seems like a waste of time. The same goes for the a-pawn. g6-g5 might be interesting to challenge the center. b7-b5 or b7-b6 are also options.
*   **Bishop moves:** The bishop on d6 has a lot of potential. Moving it to e7 or c7 doesn't seem to accomplish much. Moving it to e5 attacks the knight and opens up the diagonal for the queen. Moving it to c5 attacks the pawn on d4.
*   **Knight moves:** The knight on f3 has a lot of moves, but none of them seem particularly strong right now.
*   **Other moves:** The pawn on f5 can move to g4 or g5.

I think the most active move is to develop the bishop and put pressure on the center. I'll move the bishop from d6 to e5.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, that's a lot of moves. Let's analyze the most critical ones.

*   **h7h8=Q/R/B/N:** Promoting the pawn is tempting, but it doesn't immediately solve the problems.
*   **f5f6:** This blocks the diagonal of the white bishop on c4, but it also weakens the pawn structure.
*   **e5f6:** This captures the knight, which is good, but it opens up the diagonal for the white queen.
*   **e5d6:** This blocks the diagonal of the white bishop on c4, but it also weakens the pawn structure.
*   **f3...:** The knight moves don't seem to help much.
*   **b7b5/a7a5:** These pawn moves don't seem to help much.
*   **g6g5:** This pawn move seems to be the most promising, as it attacks the white knight on f3.

I'll go with g6g5. This attacks the knight and creates some space.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Okay, I have a lot of options. Let's analyze them.

*   **Pawn moves:** h7h8, h7g7, h7f7, h7e7, h7d7, h7c7, h7b7, h7h6, f5g6, f5f6, f5e6, f5g4, h5h4, g5g4, a7a6, a7a5. Pushing the h-pawn looks interesting, but I need to be careful about potential back rank weaknesses. The other pawn moves are mostly developing moves.
*   **Bishop moves:** e5h8, e5b8, e5g7, e5c7, e5f6, e5d6, e5d4, e5c3, e3d5, e3g4, e3c4, e3g2, e3c2, e3f1, e3d1, d3c4, d3e2, d3c2. The bishops have a lot of potential, especially the one on e5.
*   **Knight moves:** f3h4, f3d4, f3h2, f3d2, f3g1, f3e1. The knight on f3 is a bit restricted.
*   **Other:** The other pieces are not currently able to move.

Considering the position, I think I want to develop my pieces and put some pressure on the center. The bishop on e5 looks like a good piece to activate. I'll move it to g7, aiming to control the long diagonal and potentially put some pressure on the kingside.

Okay, I see the board. White has a strong attack developing. My king is somewhat exposed. I need to find a move that addresses the immediate threats and develops my pieces. Let's see what moves are available.

h7h8,h7h6,g7h8,g7f8,g7h6,g7f6,g7e5,g7d4,g7c3,f5g6,f5e6,f5g4,f3e5,f3h4,f3d4,f3h2,f3d2,f3g1,f3e1,e3d5,e3g4,e3c4,e3g2,e3c2,e3f1,e3d1,d3c4,d3e2,d3c2,f4g3,a7a6,h5h4,g5g4,a7a5

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, I've got a lot of options. Let's analyze them.

*   **Pawn moves:** `h7h8`, `h7h6`, `g7h8`, `g7f8`, `g7h6`, `g7f6`, `g7e5`, `g7d4`, `g7c3`, `f5g6`, `f5e6`, `f5g4`, `h5h4`, `g5g4`, `a7a6`, `a7a5`. Pushing the h-pawn to promote is tempting, but it's too slow. The other pawn moves don't seem to improve my position significantly.
*   **Knight moves:** `f3e5`, `f3h4`, `f3d4`, `f3h2`, `f3d2`, `f3g1`, `f3e1`. The knight on f3 is under attack. Moving it is necessary. `f3e5` looks interesting, attacking the bishop and opening the diagonal for my queen.
*   **Bishop moves:** `e3d5`, `e3g4`, `e3c4`, `e3g2`, `e3c2`, `e3f1`, `e3d1`. The bishop on e3 is also under attack.
*   **Queen moves:** No queen moves are available.
*   **Rook moves:** No rook moves are available.
*   **King moves:** No king moves are available.

Considering the threats and the need to develop, I think the best move is to move the knight from f3 to e5, attacking the white bishop and opening the diagonal for my queen.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, I've got a list of legal moves. Let's analyze them.

*   **Pawn moves:** Pushing pawns is a common opening strategy. I have a lot of options here.
*   **Knight moves:** The knight on f6 has several options. Moving it to g8 doesn't seem very useful. Moving it to h5, d5, g4, or e4 are more active.
*   **Bishop moves:** The bishop on c8 has two options.

Considering the position, I think developing the knight to a more active square is a good idea. **Nf6-h5** looks interesting, attacking the g7 pawn and potentially eyeing f4.

So, I'll make that move.

Alright, I have a list of legal moves. Let's analyze them.

*   **Pawn moves:** The pawn moves (h7h6, g7g6, f7f6, e7e6, d7d6, b7b6, a7a6, h7h5, g7g5, f7f5, e7e5, d7d5, b7b5, a7a5) seem standard for developing the position.
*   **Knight moves:** The knight moves (h5f6, h5f4, h5g3, c6b8, c6e5, c6a5, c6d4, c6b4) are interesting. The knight on c6 has a lot of options.
*   **Rook moves:** The rook moves (a8b8, h8g8) are less critical at this stage.
*   **Bishop moves:** The bishop moves (c6b8, c6e5, c6a5, c6d4, c6b4) are also interesting.

Considering the position, I think developing the knight to a more active square is a good idea. **Nc6-e5** attacks the center and prepares for further development.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, I've got a list of legal moves. Let's consider a few options.

*   **Developing the Knights:** `g8f6` and `b8c6` are standard developing moves. `g8f6` controls central squares and prepares for further development. `b8c6` also controls central squares and can support a later ...d5 push.
*   **Pawn Moves:** `h7h6`, `g7g6`, etc. are passive but can be useful to control squares and prevent white's pieces from advancing. `d7d5` is a more active pawn move, challenging the center.
*   **Other piece moves:** `f8e7` develops the bishop, but it might be better to develop the knights first.

I think developing the knight to f6 is a solid, flexible move. It controls important central squares and prepares for further development.

Developing the Knight to c6 seems like a solid developing move. It controls some central squares and prepares for further development.

Alright, I have a good understanding of the possible moves. The position is relatively open, and I need to develop my pieces and control the center. I see a few options.

*   **...f8e7**: This develops the dark-squared bishop, but it might be a bit passive.
*   **...d8e7**: This develops the queen, but it might be too early.
*   **...f6e4**: This attacks the pawn on d4 and opens up the position.
*   **...h7h6**: This is a standard pawn move, but it doesn't immediately improve my position.
*   **...d7d6**: This supports the center and prepares for further development.
*   **...g7g6**: This is a standard pawn move, but it doesn't immediately improve my position.
*   **...e5e4**: This is a very aggressive move, but it might be too risky.

I think the best move is to develop my knight to a good square and control the center. I will play ...Nf6-d5.

Okay, I have a list of legal moves. Let's analyze the position. White has a strong center with the pawn on d4 and the knight on d4. Black's queen is well-placed. I need to develop my pieces and challenge white's control of the center.

I think developing the dark-squared bishop to e7 is a good developing move. It supports the pawn structure and prepares for future development.

Okay, I have a lot of options. I think I want to develop my bishop and challenge white's control of the center. Moving the bishop to f8 seems like a good developing move.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, I have the legal moves. Let's analyze them.

*   **Pawn moves:** I see a lot of pawn moves. Pushing the pawns on the h, g, f, d, b, and a files are all possible. Pushing the e-pawn is also an option.
*   **Bishop moves:** The bishop on f8 has several diagonal options.
*   **Queen moves:** The queen on d8 has many options.
*   **Rook moves:** The rook on a8 has one move.
*   **Knight moves:** The knight on c6 has several moves.

Considering the position, I want to develop my pieces and control the center. I'll start by developing the knight on c6. The move **c6d4** looks promising, attacking the center and potentially opening lines for my queen and bishop.

Alright, I have a lot of options. Let's analyze this. White has a strong center with the pawns on c3 and d4. My bishop on f8 is currently blocked. I need to develop my pieces and challenge white's control of the center.

*   **Pawn Moves:** Pushing pawns like h7-h6 or g7-g6 is passive. I could consider ...d7-d6 to support a future ...e7-e5 break, but it doesn't immediately improve my position. ...e7-e6 is another option to support the center.
*   **Bishop Moves:** The bishop on f8 is currently blocked.
*   **Knight Moves:** The knight on d5 has several good options. ...Nf6 attacks the center and prepares to challenge white's control. ...Nb6 could be interesting, but it doesn't immediately develop my position. ...Nf4 attacks the bishop on g2.
*   **Queen Moves:** The queen on d8 is currently passive.
*   **Rook Moves:** The rooks are currently passive.
*   **King Moves:** The king is safe for now.

I think the most active and principled move is to develop my knight to f6, challenging white's control of the center and preparing to develop my pieces.

*   **Pawn Structure:** ...h6, ...g6, ...d6, ...c6, ...b6, ...a6 are all possible pawn moves to control the center and prepare for future development.
*   **Pushing the e-pawn:** ...e4 is a bold move, challenging white's control of the center.
*   **Other moves:** ...e7d6, ...e7c5, ...e7b4, ...e7a3 are all interesting bishop moves.

Alright, I've reviewed the legal moves. The position is complex. White has a strong center and some active pieces. I need to develop my pieces and challenge White's control.

I see a few options. Pushing the e-pawn seems premature. I could try to develop the bishop on f8, but it's blocked. I could also consider pawn moves to control the center.

I think the best move here is to develop my dark-squared bishop and challenge white's control of the center.

*   **...f6h5:** This attacks the knight on g3.
*   **...f6d5:** This develops the knight to a central square and attacks the pawn on c3.
*   **...d6e7:** This develops the queen.
*   **...d6c5:** This develops the queen and attacks the pawn on b2.
*   **...h7h6:** This is a standard pawn move, preventing a white knight from jumping to g5.
*   **...g7g6:** This is a standard pawn move.
*   **...c7c6:** This is a standard pawn move.
*   **...b7b6:** This is a standard pawn move.
*   **...a7a6:** This is a standard pawn move.
*   **...c7c5:** This challenges the center.
*   **...b7b5:** This challenges the center.
*   **...a7a5:** This challenges the center.

I like the look of **...f6d5**. It develops the knight to a strong central square, attacks a pawn, and opens lines for my queen.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, I've got a good list of moves. Let's consider the position. White has a strong center. I need to develop my pieces and challenge that.

*   **...d6e7** looks interesting. It develops the queen and opens the diagonal for the bishop.
*   **...d6f6** also develops the queen, but it might be a bit passive.
*   **...h7h6** and **...g7g6** are solid pawn moves, but don't really develop anything.
*   **...c7c6** and **...b7b6** are similar, and I'm not sure they are the best use of my time.
*   **...a7a6** is also a bit passive.
*   **...e5e4** is a pawn push that could open the position, but it might leave my king exposed.
*   **...h7h5** and **...g7g5** are pawn pushes that could weaken my kingside.
*   **...c7c5**, **...b7b5**, and **...a7a5** are pawn pushes that challenge the center.

I think I'll go with **...d6e7**. It develops the queen to a good square and prepares for further development.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Okay, I've got the list of legal moves. Let's analyze them.

*   **King moves:** `f8h8`, `f8g8`, `e8d8`: Moving the king doesn't seem ideal right now. It might be better to keep the king where it is for now, and develop pieces to defend it.
*   **Rook moves:** `a8b8`: This doesn't seem to help much.
*   **Queen moves:** `e7d8`, `e7f6`, `e7e6`: The queen is currently defending the king. Moving it away could be dangerous. `e7f6` looks interesting, as it develops the queen and attacks a knight.
*   **Bishop moves:** `d6c5`, `d6b4`, `d5f6`, `d5b6`, `d5f4`, `d5b4`, `d5e3`, `d5c3`: The bishops don't have great options right now.
*   **Knight moves:** `d4e6`, `d4c6`, `d4f5`, `d4b5`, `d4f3`, `d4b3`, `d4e2`, `d4c2`: The knight on d4 has a lot of options, but none of them seem immediately helpful.
*   **Pawn moves:** `g7f6`, `h7h6`, `g7g6`, `c7c6`, `b7b6`, `a7a6`, `e5e4`, `h7h5`, `g7g5`, `c7c5`, `b7b5`, `a7a5`: Pawn moves don't seem to improve the position significantly.

Considering the position, I think the best move is to develop the queen to f6, attacking the white knight and preparing to defend the king.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, I have a lot of options. White's queen is a threat, and I need to develop my pieces and defend.

*   **f8h8, f8g8, e8d8, a8b8:** These are rook moves. Moving the rook doesn't seem to immediately address the threat.
*   **e8e7:** This is a king move. It might be a good idea to get the king out of the center.
*   **f6d8, f6e7, f6h6, f6g6, f6e6, f6g5, f6f5, f6h4, f6f4, f6f3, f6f2:** These are bishop moves. The bishop on f6 is currently blocked.
*   **d6e7, d6c5, d6b4, d6a3:** These are queen moves. The queen is a key piece, but moving it without a clear plan could be dangerous.
*   **d5e7, d5b6, d5f4, d5b4, d5e3, d5c3:** These are queen moves.
*   **d4e6, d4c6, d4f5, d4b5, d4f3, d4b3, d4e2, d4c2:** These are queen moves.
*   **h7h6, g7g6, c7c6, b7b6, a7a6, e5e4, h7h5, g7g5, c7c5, a7a5:** These are pawn moves. Pushing pawns can help control the center and develop.

I think the best move here is to develop my king to a safer position.

*   **f8h8, f8g8, f8e8, f8d8, a8b8, e7e8, e7d8:** These are all moves with the rooks and king. Not immediately helpful.
*   **f6h6, f6g6, f6e6, f6g5, f6f5, f6h4, f6f4, f6f3, f6f2:** These are pawn moves. Some of them look like they could open lines for my pieces.

*   **d5b6, d5f4, d5b4, d5e3, d5c3:** These are bishop moves.
*   **d4e6, d4c6, d4f5, d4b5, d4f3, d4b3, d4e2, d4c2:** These are knight moves.
*   **h7h6, g7g6, c7c6, b7b6, a7a6, e5e4, h7h5, g7g5, c7c5, a7a5:** These are pawn moves.

I think I should try to develop my bishop and put some pressure on the center. **...Bc5** looks like a good developing move, attacking the knight on d4 and potentially opening lines for my queen.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, a lot of options. White's Queen on d2 is a major threat. I need to address that. I see a few possibilities:

*   **...Bf8-h6:** This develops the Bishop and potentially defends against a Queen attack on g7.
*   **...f6-f5:** This challenges White's control of the center and opens lines for my pieces.
*   **...d5-b6:** This attacks the White pawn on c4.

Considering the immediate threat, I think developing the Bishop to h6 is the most prudent move. It directly defends the g7 square and prepares for further development.

You are absolutely right! I misread the board and made an illegal move. My Bishop is on c8, not f8. My apologies. Let me re-evaluate.

Okay, the Bishop on c8 can go to b7, d7, or e6. Developing the Bishop is still a good idea.

*   **...Bc8-b7:** This develops the Bishop and eyes the a8-h1 diagonal.
*   **...Bc8-d7:** This develops the Bishop and prepares to defend the King.
*   **...Bc8-e6:** This develops the Bishop and attacks the White Queen.

Attacking the Queen seems most active.

The Bishop can go to b7 or d7.

*   **...Bc8-d7:** Develops the Bishop and defends the King.

I think developing the Bishop to b7 is the best move. It develops the piece and prepares for future attacks.

Okay, I have a lot of options. Let's analyze a bit.

*   **King safety:** My king is currently safe.
*   **Piece development:** I have a knight and a bishop developed, but my other pieces are still on their starting squares.
*   **Pawn structure:** The pawn structure is relatively closed.
*   **Immediate threats:** There are no immediate threats.

I want to develop my pieces and control the center. The move ...g6 seems like a good developing move, preparing to fianchetto my bishop on g7. It also prevents a potential white knight jump to f5.

Therefore, I will make the move g7g6.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Okay, I have a lot of options. Let's analyze them.

*   **Pawn moves:** I see a lot of pawn moves. Pushing the pawns on the queenside (a7, b7, c7) seems like a solid, developing strategy. Pushing the h-pawn to h5 could be interesting later.
*   **Knight moves:** The knight on b8 has several options. Nc6 looks like a good developing move, controlling central squares.
*   **Bishop moves:** The bishop on f6 has many options.
*   **Queen moves:** The queen on d8 has several options.
*   **King moves:** The king has a few options.

Considering the position, I think developing the knight to c6 is a good, solid move. It controls important central squares and prepares for further development.

Okay, I've got a lot of options. Let's analyze them:

*   **King moves:** Moving the king is tempting, but it's not clear where to go that's safe.
*   **Queen moves:** The queen is under attack, so I need to move it.
*   **Rook moves:** The rooks don't have immediate threats.
*   **Bishop moves:** The bishops are somewhat restricted.
*   **Knight moves:** The knights could be useful.
*   **Pawn moves:** Pawn moves are limited.

The most pressing issue is the queen. I need to move it to safety. I can move the queen to d8. This move develops the queen to a more active position and protects the king.

Therefore, I will make the move Qd8.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Okay, I have a lot of options. Let's analyze a few key possibilities:

*   **Developing the Bishop on g4:** Moves like Bg4-h3 or Bg4-f3 look tempting to develop the bishop, but they don't immediately challenge White's central control.
*   **Queen moves:** Qe7 looks like a good developing move to control the center.
*   **Pawn moves:** Pushing pawns like h7-h5 or g6-g5 can create space, but might weaken my pawn structure.
*   **Knight moves:** Nc6-d4 looks interesting as it attacks the center and can potentially open the position.

Considering the position, I think the most active and challenging move is to develop my knight to d4. This attacks the center, forces White to respond, and opens lines for my queen and bishop.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Okay, I've got a lot of options. Let's analyze them.

*   **Defensive moves:** `h8g8`, `h8f8`, `h8h7` are all rook moves. Moving the rook doesn't immediately address any threats.
*   **Queen moves:** `d8e7`, `d7c8`, `d7e7`, `d7e6`, `d7d6`, `d7c6`, `d7f5`, `d7b5`, `d7a4` are all queen moves. The queen is currently well-placed, and moving it now might expose the king further. `d7e7` looks like a reasonable developing move, but doesn't address any immediate threats.
*   **Knight moves:** `f6g8`, `f6h7`, `f6h5`, `f6d5`, `f6e4` are knight moves. `f6h5` attacks the white pawn on g3, which could be interesting.
*   **Bishop moves:** `g4h5`, `g4f5`, `g4h3`, `g4f3`, `g4e2` are bishop moves. The bishop on g4 is somewhat passive.
*   **Pawn moves:** `d4e6`, `d4c6`, `d4f5`, `d4b5`, `d4f3`, `d4b3`, `d4e2`, `d4c2`, `c7d6`, `g6f5`, `c7c6`, `b7b6`, `a7a6`, `h6h5`, `g6g5`, `e5e4`, `c7c5`, `b7b5`, `a7a5` are pawn moves. Pushing pawns can be useful for controlling the center or creating space, but some of these moves could weaken my position.

Considering the position, I think the most active move is to develop the knight and attack the pawn on g3. This forces White to react.

Okay, I have a lot of options. Let's analyze them:

*   **King moves:** `h8g8, h8f8, e8f8, e8e7, e8g8` - Moving the king doesn't seem immediately helpful. `h8h7` is a possibility to get the rook out of the way.
*   **Queen moves:** `d8e7, d8f6, d8g5, d8h4` - The queen is under attack. `d8e7` seems like a reasonable developing move.
*   **Rook moves:** `a8c8, a8b8` - These are passive moves.
*   **Pawn moves:** `d7c8, d7e7, d7e6, d7d6, d7c6, d7f5, d7d5, d7b5, d7a4, f7f6, c7c6, b7b6, a7a6, g6g5, c7c5, b7b5, a7a5` - Many pawn moves, but none immediately impactful.
*   **Bishop moves:** `h5g7, h5f6, h5f4, h5g3, g4f5, g4h3, g4f3, g4e2` - The bishop on h5 is a bit passive. `h5f6` attacks the white knight.
*   **Knight moves:** `d4e6, d4c6, d4f5, d4b5, d4f3, d4b3, d4e2, d4c2` - The knight on d4 has many options.

Considering the threats and development, I think the best move is to develop the queen and defend the pawn on d7. I'll move the queen to e7.

Okay, I see the board. Black's king is on e8, and the queen is on d7. White has a strong center with pawns on d4 and e4. Black needs to develop pieces and challenge the center. Let's see what moves are available.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Okay, I have a lot of options. Let's analyze a few of them.

*   **...Qe6:** This develops the queen to a more active square, attacks the pawn on e4, and prepares to challenge White's control of the center. This looks like a good developing move.
*   **...Nf6:** This develops the knight, controls important central squares, and prepares to challenge White's control of the center.
*   **...c6:** This supports the pawn on d5 and prepares to challenge White's control of the center.

I think ...Qe6 is the most active and direct move. It immediately puts pressure on White.

That's a lot of moves! Let's analyze the position a bit. White has a strong attack brewing, especially with the queen and bishop on the queenside. My king is a bit exposed. I need to prioritize defense and development.

Looking at the moves, I see several pawn moves that could help control the center or support my pieces. I also see some moves that could develop my pieces.

I think the best move here is to develop my bishop and put some pressure on the center.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Okay, that's a lot of moves. Let's analyze them.

*   **King moves:** `h8g8, h8f8, e8f8, e8d8, e8e7, e8d7, e8g8, e8c8` - Moving the king is risky right now, especially with the open files. I need to focus on defense and development. `e8e7` looks like a possibility to get the king a bit safer.
*   **Rook moves:** `a8d8, a8c8, a8b8` - These don't immediately help the defense.
*   **Queen moves:** `f6d8, f6g7, f6e7, f6g5, f6e5, f6h4` - The queen is well-placed, but moving it could expose the king further. `f6e7` looks like a good defensive move.
*   **Bishop moves:** `e6c8, e6e7, e6d7, e6d6, e6c6, e6b6, e6a6, e6f5, e6e5, e6d5, e6e4, e6e3` - The bishop on e6 is important. `e6e7` is a good defensive move.
*   **Knight moves:** `h5g7, h5f4, h5g3, g4f5, g4h3, g4f3, g4e2` - The knight on h5 is a bit passive. The knight on g4 has some interesting options.
*   **Pawn moves:** `c7c6, b7b6, a7a6, g6g5, c7c5, b7b5, a7a5` - Pawn moves can help control the center and restrict white's pieces. `c7c6` looks solid.

Considering the position, I think the best move is to develop the queen to a more defensive position and support the defense of the king.

*   **Development:** I need to develop my pieces. The bishop on f8 is blocked. The rooks are not active.

Considering the position, I think the best move is to develop the pawn to f6, defending against the potential attack and opening a line for my bishop.

*   **Defending the King:** The immediate threat is likely from the rook on h1. Moving the king is a priority. `h8g8` and `h8f8` are the most important moves to consider.
*   **Developing Pieces:** I need to develop my pieces to counterattack. The bishop on f8 is blocked. The queen is well-placed. The pawns on the e-file are vulnerable.
*   **Tactical Considerations:** White's queen is a threat.

Given the options, I think the best move is to move the king to safety. `h8g8` seems like the most sensible option.

*   **Defensive moves:** I need to consider moves that directly address the immediate threats.
*   **Developing moves:** I should also look for moves that develop my pieces and improve my position.
*   **Tactical considerations:** Are there any immediate tactical opportunities for me or for white?

Looking at the board, White's queen on d4 is a major threat. I need to address this. The move **e7d6** looks like a good option. It defends the pawn on e6, potentially opens the diagonal for my bishop, and challenges White's queen.

Therefore, I will make the move e7d6.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Okay, that's a lot of moves. White is clearly threatening a checkmate. Let's analyze the most critical moves.

*   **Defending the King:** The king has a few escape squares, but they don't seem to help much.
*   **Developing Pieces:** I need to develop my pieces to defend. The queen is well-placed.
*   **Attacking White's King:** I need to try and create counterplay.

The most pressing threat seems to be from the white queen and rook on the h-file. I need to block that.

I'm going to move my rook from a8 to d8 to defend against the threat on the h-file.

That's a lot of possible moves! Let's analyze the position. White seems to have a strong attack brewing, especially with the queen and rook on the open files. Black's king is somewhat exposed. I need to prioritize defense and development.

The move ...Qe7 looks like a good developing move, getting the queen off the back rank and potentially supporting the defense of the kingside. It also opens up the diagonal for the bishop on c8.

That's a lot of moves! Let's analyze the most promising ones.

*   **...e7e6:** This looks like a solid developing move, supporting the pawn structure and potentially opening lines for the queen.
*   **...e7e5:** This is more aggressive, challenging the center. It could lead to a sharp game.
*   **...d6e5:** This attacks the white knight and opens the diagonal for the bishop.
*   **...g6g5:** This is a pawn push that could challenge white's control of the center.

Considering the position, I think ...e7e6 is the most solid and developing move. It prepares for further development and strengthens the pawn structure.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, I have a lot of options. Let's analyze them.

*   **Pawn moves:** I have pawn moves available on a7, b7, c7, g6. Pushing pawns can open lines, but I need to be careful not to weaken my position too much.
*   **Queen moves:** The queen on d8 has many moves.
*   **Bishop moves:** The bishop on f8 has limited moves. The bishop on c8 has many moves.
*   **Knight moves:** The knight on g8 has a few moves. The knight on d4 has many moves.
*   **King moves:** The king on e8 has a few moves.

The most active piece is my queen. I want to develop it to a more active square. Moving the queen to e7 seems like a good developing move, controlling the e-file and potentially putting pressure on the white king.

Therefore, I will move my queen to e7.

Alright, that's a lot of moves. Let's analyze the most critical ones. White's queen and rooks are posing a significant threat. My king is vulnerable.

*   **Defensive moves:** I need to consider moves that directly defend against immediate threats.
*   **Development:** Developing my pieces is crucial to counterattack.
*   **King Safety:** Improving my king's safety is paramount.

Considering the available moves, I see a few that warrant closer inspection:

*   **...Qd7:** This move seems to be a good defensive move, as it defends the king and opens up the possibility of developing the queen to a more active square later.
*   **...e7e6:** This move will help protect the king and give the king a flight square.

I'll choose ...Qd7 as it is a more active defensive move.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Okay, that's a lot of moves. Let's analyze them.

*   **King moves:** The king moves are limited and don't seem to improve the situation.
*   **Queen moves:** The queen has several moves, but moving the queen doesn't seem to address the immediate threats.
*   **Pawn moves:** Pawn moves like c7c6, b7b6, a7a6, c7c5, a7a5 are passive and don't help. g6g5 looks interesting, trying to open the g-file.
*   **Bishop moves:** The bishop on d6 has several moves, but none of them seem to immediately solve the problem.
*   **Knight moves:** The knight on h5 has a few moves.
*   **Other moves:** g8h8, g8f8, g8e8, g8g7, d8f8, d8e8, d8c8, d8b8, d8a8, e7f8, e7e8, e7h7, e7g7, e7f7, e7e6, e7e5, e7e4, d7e8, d7c8, d6e5, d6c5, d6f4, d6b4, d6g3, d6a3, h5g7, h5f4, h5g3, g4f5, g4h3, g4f3, d4e6, d4c6, d4f5, d4b5, d4f3, d4b3, d4e2, d4c2, g6f5, c7c6, b7b6, a7a6, g6g5, c7c5, a7a5

The most pressing issue is the attack on my king. I need to find a move that either defends the king or creates counterplay. The move **g6g5** looks like the most promising. It opens the g-file and potentially creates a threat against the white king.

Therefore, I'll make the move g6g5.

That's a lot of moves! Let's analyze the position. White has a strong attack, and my king is a bit exposed. I need to be careful.

*   **Queen moves:** The queen on d8 has several options. Moving it to defend the king seems like a good idea.
*   **Pawn moves:** Pushing pawns to create space or block attacks is also important.
*   **Other pieces:** Knights and bishops can also contribute to the defense.

Considering the threats and available moves, I'll move my queen to defend the king.

*   **White's Bishop on f5:** This bishop is eyeing my weak squares.
*   **My King's safety:** My king is very exposed.

Looking at the moves, I see a few possibilities. I need to prioritize defense.

*   **...Qh7:** This seems like a good defensive move, blocking the immediate checkmate threat and potentially developing my queen to a more active position.

Let's make that move.

*   **Developing moves:** The knight on g4 is somewhat passive. Moves like `g4f3` or `g4h3` could be useful.
*   **Counterplay:** Black needs to create some threats. The pawn on h7 could be advanced.

Considering the position and the need to defend, I'll move the King to e7. This gets the King out of the immediate line of fire and prepares for further defensive maneuvers.

That's a lot of moves! White's attack is very threatening. Let's analyze the most critical threats and try to find a move that addresses them.

*   **White's Queen and Rooks:** The queen on h8, and rooks on a8 and f8 are a huge threat.
*   **King Safety:** My king is very exposed.

Looking at the moves, I need to find a way to defend my king and ideally develop some counterplay.

*   **...g8g7:** This seems like a reasonable defensive move to protect the king.
*   **...h7g6:** This move looks interesting, it opens the h-file and might create some counterplay.
*   **...e7e6:** This move blocks the diagonal of the white bishop on e5.
*   **...d6e5:** This move attacks the white bishop on e5.

Considering the threats, I think the most important thing is to defend the king. ...g8g7 seems like the most solid move.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, that's a lot of moves. The immediate threat seems to be the rook on f7. I need to address that. I also need to consider the position of my king.

Let's see... moving the pawn on h7 to h6 seems like a reasonable defensive move, but it doesn't address the immediate threat. Moving the pawn on g7 to g6 also doesn't help.

The best move appears to be to move the pawn on e7 to e6, blocking the attack on the king and potentially opening a line for the queen.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, that's a lot of moves to consider! Let's break this down and try to find the best one.

*   **Pawn Moves:** The pawns offer a lot of options, but most of them seem to be developing moves. The pawn on g7 can move to g6 or g5, which are good for controlling the center. The pawn on h7 can promote to a queen or rook, which is a good option.
*   **Bishop Moves:** The bishop on d6 has a lot of moves, but most of them don't seem to be very useful.
*   **Knight Moves:** The knight on g4 has a few moves, but they don't seem to be very useful.
*   **King Moves:** The king has no moves.
*   **Rook Moves:** The rook on e5 has no moves.
*   **Queen Moves:** The queen has no moves.

Considering the position, I think the best move is to promote the pawn on h7 to a queen. This will give me a powerful piece and put pressure on the white king.

Okay, I have the legal moves. The most pressing issue is the attack on my king. I see several moves that involve the queen. Let's analyze the possibilities.

*   **h8g8, h8f8, h8e8, h8d8, h8c8, h8b8, h8a8:** Moving the queen along the back rank doesn't seem to address the immediate threats.
*   **h8h7, h8h6:** These moves don't help either.
*   **g7g8, g7h7, g7f7, g7e7, g7g6, g7g5:** Moving the pawn doesn't seem to improve the situation.
*   **d7e8, d7d8, d7e7:** These moves don't seem to help.
*   **e6e8, e6e7, e6e5, e6e4, e6e3:** Moving the pawn doesn't seem to improve the situation.
*   **d6f8, d6e7, d6e5, d6c5, d6f4, d6b4, d6g3, d6a3:** Moving the bishop doesn't seem to improve the situation.
*   **h5f4, h5g3:** Moving the knight doesn't seem to improve the situation.
*   **g4f5, g4h3, g4f3, g4e2, g4d1:** Moving the knight doesn't seem to improve the situation.
*   **d4c6, d4f5, d4b5, d4f3, d4b3, d4e2, d4c2:** Moving the knight doesn't seem to improve the situation.
*   **c7c6, a7a6, c7c5, a7a5:** These pawn moves don't seem to help.

The most critical threat is the potential checkmate. I need to find a move that defends the king. After careful consideration, I believe the best move is to move the queen to defend the king.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Okay, I have the list of legal moves. Let's analyze them.

*   **Pawn moves:** There are a lot of pawn moves. Pushing the h-pawn to promote (h7h8) looks tempting, but it's likely to be immediately captured. The same goes for g7g8. Pushing pawns on the g and h files doesn't seem to help the immediate danger.
*   **Queen moves:** The queen has several moves, but none of them seem to immediately alleviate the pressure.
*   **Bishop moves:** The bishop on d4 has several options, but none of them seem to be particularly effective in the current situation.
*   **Knight moves:** The knight on g4 has a few moves.
*   **Other moves:**

The most pressing issue is the threat to the king. I need to find a move that either defends the king or creates counterplay.

Looking at the position, I think I have to try to create some counterplay. The knight on g4 can attack the bishop on f3.

Therefore, I will move the knight from g4 to f3.

Alright, that's a lot of moves. Let's analyze the options.

*   **Pawn moves:** The pawn moves on the h-file (h7h8, h7g8, h7h6, h7g6, h7f5) are interesting. Promoting the h-pawn to a queen (h7h8) or rook (h7g8) could be a way to defend. The other pawn moves seem less impactful.
*   **King moves:** The king has no safe moves.
*   **Knight moves:** The knight moves (d4c6, d4f5, d4b5, d4b3, d4e2, d4c2) don't seem to improve the position significantly.
*   **Bishop moves:** The bishop moves (f3a8, f3b7, f3c6, f3d5, f3g4, f3e4, f3g2, f3e2, f3d1) are not immediately helpful.
*   **Other pawn moves:** The pawn moves (g7g8, g7f7, g7e7, g7g6, g7g5, g7g4, g7g3, d7d8, d7e7, d7d6, d7c6, e6e8, e6e7, e6d6, e6e5, e6e4, e6e3, c7d6, c7c6, a7a6, c7c5, a7a5) don't seem to help.

The most critical threat is the attack on the king. Promoting the h-pawn to a queen seems like the best defensive option.

*   **e6e5, e6e4, e6e3:** These moves with the pawn seem to open the position and might be risky.
*   **h5f4, h5g3:** The knight moves are interesting, but they don't seem to address the immediate threats.
*   **d4c6, d4f5, d4b5, d4b3, d4e2, d4c2:** The knight moves are also interesting, but they don't seem to address the immediate threats.
*   **f3a8, f3b7, f3c6, f3d5, f3g4, f3e4, f3g2, f3e2, f3d1:** The bishop moves are interesting, but they don't seem to address the immediate threats.
*   **c7d6, c7c6, a7a6, c7c5, a7a5:** These pawn moves don't seem to help much.

I think the best move here is to push the g-pawn. It creates space, potentially opens lines for the rook, and doesn't weaken my position too much. I'll play g7-g6.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Okay, that's a lot of moves. Let's analyze the most critical ones.

*   **h8h7**: This defends the back rank and prevents a potential back-rank mate. It's a solid defensive move.
*   **h8g7**: This moves the queen to a more active square, potentially eyeing the kingside.
*   **d7d6**: This blocks the d-file and could help consolidate the position.
*   **e6e5**: This challenges the center and opens lines for the black pieces.
*   **d4f5**: This attacks the knight and could create some tactical complications.

Considering the threats and the need to develop counterplay, I think **h8g7** is the best move. It develops the queen to a more active square, potentially putting pressure on the kingside and opening up the possibility of a counterattack.

Okay, that's a lot of moves. Let's analyze the most promising ones.

*   **Developing moves:** `h6h7`, `g6g5`, `d4c6`, `d4f5`, `f3e4` are all developing moves.
*   **King safety:** None of the moves directly improve king safety, but developing pieces can indirectly help.
*   **Tactical considerations:** The position is tactically complex.

I think developing the knight on f3 is a good idea. `f3e4` attacks the pawn on d2 and opens up the diagonal for the bishop.

*   **d7d8**: Promotes the pawn to a queen. This looks tempting, but it doesn't immediately solve the problems.
*   **d7e7**: This move doesn't seem to help much.
*   **d7e6**: This move doesn't seem to help much.
*   **d7c6**: This move doesn't seem to help much.
*   **d4e6**: This move doesn't seem to help much.

The best move seems to be to promote the pawn to a queen. This will give me more attacking power.

*   **g6g8, g6g7, g6g5, g6g4, g6g3:** The pawn on g6 has several moves.
*   **h5g7, h5f4, h5g3:** The knight on h5 has a lot of movement options.
*   **e4a8, e4b7, e4c6, e4f5, e4d5, e4f3, e4d3, e4g2:** The knight on e4 has a lot of movement options.
*   **d4e6, d4c6, d4f5, d4b5, d4f3, d4b3, d4e2, d4c2:** The knight on d4 has a lot of movement options.
*   **c7d6, c7c6:** The pawn on c7 has several moves.
*   **a7a6, a7a5:** The pawn on a7 has several moves.
*   **f6f5:** The pawn on f6 has several moves.
*   **d8e7:** The queen on d8 has several moves.

The most pressing threat seems to be the knight on e4. It is attacking the queen. I need to move the queen. The best move seems to be to move the queen to a safe square.

*   **h7h8=Q** is a tempting promotion, but it doesn't immediately solve the problem.
*   **e7e6** looks like a good defensive move, blocking the immediate threat and potentially opening lines for my queen.
*   **g6g5** also looks like a good defensive move, blocking the immediate threat and potentially opening lines for my queen.

I'm going to choose **e7e6**. It directly addresses the threat and gives me some breathing room.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, I have a list of legal moves. Let's analyze them:

*   **Pawn moves:** h7h8, h7g8, h7g7, h7f7, h7e7, h7d7, h7h6, g6g8, g6g7, g6h6, g6g5, g6g4, g6g3, e6e7, e6d7, e6d5, c7d6, c7c6, a7a6, f6f5, a7a5. These are mostly defensive or developing moves.
*   **Knight moves:** h5g7, h5f4, h5g3. The knight on h5 is somewhat awkwardly placed.

Considering the position, I want to:

1.  **Defend the king:** The immediate threat seems to be from the white queen and bishop.
2.  **Develop pieces:** Get my pieces into active positions.
3.  **Create counterplay:** Look for ways to attack white's king.

The move **h7h6** seems like a good defensive move, preventing a potential queen check on h7. It also opens up a potential escape route for the king.

Therefore, I will play h7h6.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, I have a lot of options. Let's break this down.

*   **Pawn moves:** `h6h8`, `h6h7`, `g6g8`, `g6g7`, `c7c6`, `a7a6`, `f6f5`, `a7a5`. These are mostly pawn moves. `h6h8` and `g6g8` are pawn promotions which are not good in this position. `h6h7` and `g6g7` are also not good. `c7c6` and `a7a6` are passive. `f6f5` is interesting, but might weaken my kingside. `a7a5` is also passive.
*   **Knight moves:** `h5g7`, `h5f4`, `h5g3`, `d5e6`, `d5c6`. `h5g7` is not good. `h5f4` attacks the queen, which is interesting. `h5g3` is also not good. `d5e6` and `d5c6` are also not good.
*   **Bishop moves:** `e4f3`, `e4g2`. `e4f3` attacks the queen, which is interesting. `e4g2` is not good.

My main concerns are the threats against my king. White's queen and rook on the e-file are a problem. I need to develop a defense.

I think the best move here is to attack the white queen with my knight. This forces White to react.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, I've got a lot of options. Let's analyze them.

*   **Pawn moves:** Moving the h-pawn seems like a waste of time. g6-g5 looks interesting, trying to challenge the center. c7-c6 and a7-a6 are standard pawn moves, but don't seem to help much right now. f6-f5 is also a possibility.
*   **Knight moves:** The knight on f4 has several options, but none seem particularly effective.
*   **Bishop moves:** No bishop moves are available.
*   **Queen moves:** No queen moves are available.
*   **King moves:** No king moves are available.

The most promising moves seem to be g6-g5 or f6-f5. g6-g5 directly challenges the center and opens the g-file for potential counterplay. f6-f5 also challenges the center and opens the f-file.

I'll choose **g6g5**. It's a direct challenge and opens lines for my pieces.

*   **Pawn Moves (g5):** g5g8, g5g7, g5g6, g5h5, g5f5, g5e5, g5g4, g5g3. Pushing the pawn to g6 could help defend the king.
*   **Knight Moves (f4):** f4g6, f4e6, f4h5, f4h3, f4d3, f4g2, f4e2. The knight is in a precarious position. Moving it could help defend.
*   **Pawn Moves (c7):** c7d6, c7c6. These are standard pawn moves.
*   **Pawn Moves (a7):** a7a6, a7a5. These are standard pawn moves.
*   **Pawn Moves (f6):** f6f5. This pawn move doesn't seem to help much.
*   **Knight Moves (d5):** d5e6, d5c6. The knight is in a precarious position. Moving it could help defend.
*   **Queen moves (e4):** e4f3. This move doesn't seem to help much.

I think the most important thing is to defend the king. I'm going to move the pawn on g5 to g6. This blocks a potential check from the white queen and helps consolidate the defense.

Alright, I've got the legal moves. White is threatening a lot. I need to defend and develop.

*   **h6h5** looks like a good defensive move, preventing a potential check on h7.
*   **c7c6** is a solid developing move.
*   **d5c6** looks interesting, but might open up my king.
*   **g6g5** could be interesting to challenge the center.

I think I'll go with **h6h5** to protect my king.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Okay, I've got a lot of options. Let's analyze them.

*   **Pawn moves:** `g6g8`, `g6g7`, `g6h6`, `g6g5`, `g6g4`, `g6g3`, `h5h8`, `h5h7`, `h5h6`, `h5g5`, `h5f5`, `h5e5`, `h5h4`, `h5g4`, `h5h3`, `h5f3`, `h5h2`, `h5h1`, `c7c6`, `a7a6`, `f6f5`, `a7a5` - These are mostly defensive, trying to create space or block attacks. `c7c6` and `a7a6` are probably too passive. Pushing the h-pawn seems risky. `f6f5` could challenge the center, but it weakens my king's defense.

*   **Knight moves:** `d5e6`, `d5c6` - These moves don't seem to help much.

*   **Bishop moves:** `f4e6`, `f4h3`, `f4d3`, `f4g2`, `f4e2` - `f4e6` could be interesting, but it doesn't immediately improve my position.

*   **Other moves:** `e4f3` - This is a knight move, but it's not a legal move.

Considering the board and the available moves, I think the best move is to try to develop my bishop and put pressure on the white queen.

I'll move my bishop from f4 to e6.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Okay, I have two legal moves: d5c6 and e6d4.

*   **d5c6:** This captures the knight on c6 with the pawn on d5. This seems like a reasonable trade, removing a white attacker.
*   **e6d4:** This moves the pawn on e6 to d4. This is a more aggressive move, attacking the white queen and opening the position.

Given the position, I think **e6d4** is the better move. It forces White to react to the threat against their queen, and it opens up the position for my pieces.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, I have a lot of options. White's attack is the immediate threat. Let's analyze the possibilities:

*   **Pawn moves:** Pushing the pawns on the h-file and g-file don't seem to help much. The pawn on c7 and a7 are also not immediately helpful. f6f5 looks like it could challenge white's control of the center.
*   **Knight moves:** The knight on d4 has several moves, but none of them seem to directly address the immediate threat.
*   **King moves:** The king is trapped.
*   **Queen moves:** The queen has a lot of options, but I need to find a move that defends the king.
*   **Rook moves:** The rook on g7 is not doing much.

The most pressing issue is the attack on the king. I need to find a move that defends the king. The move **d4f3** looks interesting. It attacks the white queen.

Let's make the move.

*   **...g6g5:** This challenges White's control of the center and opens the g-file for my rook.
*   **...h5h4:** This attacks White's knight and could create some tactical possibilities.
*   **...c7c6:** This supports my pawn structure and prepares to develop my pieces.
*   **...f6f5:** This challenges White's control of the center.

I think the most active move is to challenge White's center. I will play ...f6f5.

*   **h5-h8, h5-h7, h5-h6, h5-g5, h5-h4, h5-g4, h5-h3, h5-h2, h5-h1:** The pawn on h5 is also not in a good position to move.
*   **d5-e6, d5-c6, d5-c5:** Moving the pawn on d5 doesn't seem to help much.
*   **e4-f3, e4-d3:** These are pawn moves that don't seem to help.
*   **f5-g4:** This pawn move seems to be the most promising.
*   **c7-c6, a7-a6, f5-f4, a7-a5:** These are pawn moves that don't seem to help.

The most interesting move seems to be **f5-g4**. This attacks the Bishop on f5.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, I have a list of legal moves. Let's analyze them.

*   **Pawn moves (g6...):** Moving the pawn on g6 doesn't seem to help much. It doesn't directly defend the king or develop a piece.
*   **Pawn moves (h5...):** The pawn on h5 has a lot of options, but none of them seem to be immediately helpful.
*   **Bishop moves (e4...):** The bishop on e4 is attacking the king. I need to address this.
*   **Pawn moves (c7...):** Moving the pawn on c7 doesn't seem to help.
*   **Pawn moves (a7...):** Moving the pawn on a7 doesn't seem to help.

The most pressing issue is the attack on the king by the Bishop on e4. I need to move the pawn on g6 to block the attack.

I will move the pawn on g6 to g5.

*   **Pawn moves (h6, c7, a7):** These are mostly defensive, trying to limit White's attack. Pushing the h-pawn seems like the most active of these.
*   **e4 moves:** The Queen is a major threat. Moving the Queen to defend the King is a priority.
*   **d5 moves:** This is a pawn move that can block the Queen.

Considering the threats, I think the best move is to develop the Queen and defend the King.

*   **h6...:** The pawn on h6 has a lot of options, but promoting it immediately to a queen is not possible. Moving it up the board doesn't seem to help much.
*   **c6...:** The pawn on c6 has some options. Moving it to c5 seems like a reasonable developing move, challenging the center.
*   **f5...:** The bishop on f5 has several moves. Moving it to e6 could be interesting, attacking the knight.
*   **a7...:** The pawn on a7 has limited options.

Considering the position, I think the best move is to develop my bishop and attack the knight.

*   **King moves:** The king is currently safe.

Considering the position, I'll focus on developing my pieces and controlling the center. The bishop on e6 seems well-placed to control the long diagonal. I'll move the bishop to a more active square.

Alright, I have a few options. The pawn on h6 has a lot of potential moves. The bishop on f5 also has some interesting possibilities. Let's see...

The pawn moves look tempting, but I don't want to overextend too early. The bishop on f5 could be a good attacking piece. I think I will develop my bishop.

Okay, I have the legal moves. The queen on h3 has a lot of options. I see a few possibilities.

*   **Qh7** attacks the knight on h8 and puts pressure on the kingside.
*   **Qh5** attacks the pawn on g6 and potentially opens the h-file.
*   **Qh6** is also an option, but it doesn't seem as immediately threatening.

I'm going to go with **Qh7**. It's the most direct threat and forces White to react.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Okay, I have the legal moves. Let's analyze them.

*   **Queen moves:** The queen has a lot of options, but many of them are blocked or lead to exchanges that don't seem advantageous. Moving the queen to h8, g8, g7, f7, e7, d7, h6, g6, h5, f5, h4, h3, h2, or h1 are all possibilities.
*   **King moves:** The king can move to d7, b7, d5, c5, or b5.
*   **Pawn moves:** The pawn on a7 can move to a6 or a5.

I need to consider the threats and potential attacks. White's rook on f8 is a potential threat, but it's currently blocked. White's bishop on e5 is also a threat.

I think the best move is to develop the queen to a more active square and put pressure on the white king. I'll move the queen to h5. This attacks the g6 pawn and opens up lines for the queen.

*   **h6h7:** This defends the pawn, but doesn't really improve my position.
*   **h6h5:** This is a more active defense, pushing the pawn forward.
*   **h6g6, h6g5, h6f6, h6e6, h6d6:** These moves are all captures, but they don't seem to be beneficial.
*   **c6d7, c6b7, c6c5, c6b5:** These moves with the pawn on c6 don't seem to help the situation.
*   **a7a6, a7a5:** These moves with the pawn on a7 don't seem to help the situation.

Pushing the pawn on h6 to h5 seems like the most logical move. It defends the pawn and opens up a potential escape route for my king if needed.

Okay, I see the board. Black's king is in a precarious position, and white has a strong attack. I need to find a move that defends the king and potentially creates counterplay. Let's see what moves are available.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Okay, I have a list of legal moves. The most pressing concern is the attack on my king. I see a few options to consider:

*   **Defensive moves:** Moving the pawn on h6.
*   **Counterplay:** Moving the pawn on a7.

Let's analyze the pawn moves on h6. Moving the pawn on h6 can block the attack from the white knight.

*   **h6h5:** This move doesn't seem to help much.
*   **h6h7:** This move also doesn't seem to help much.
*   **h6g5, h6g6, h6g7, h6f4, h6f6, h6f8, h6e3, h6e6, h6d2, h6d6, h6h1, h6h2, h6h3, h6h4:** These moves are either irrelevant or weaken the king's position.

Now let's consider the pawn on a7.

*   **a7a6:** This move doesn't seem to help much.
*   **a7a5:** This move doesn't seem to help much.

Considering the available moves, the best move is to defend the king.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Okay, I have the legal moves. Let's analyze them.

*   **Pawn moves:** `b7c8`, `b7b8`, `b7a8`, `b7c6`, `b7a6`, `c7c6`, `a7a6`, `a7a5`. Pushing the pawns seems like a reasonable way to control the center and develop. `b7c8`, `b7b8`, `b7a8` are pawn promotions, but not immediately relevant.
*   **h5 pawn moves:** `h5e8`, `h5f7`, `h5h6`, `h5g6`, `h5g5`, `h5f5`, `h5e5`, `h5d5`, `h5c5`, `h5h4`, `h5h3`, `h5h2`, `h5h1`. Pushing the h-pawn doesn't seem to achieve much right now.

I think the most active move is to push the c-pawn to control more of the center.

Okay, I've got the legal moves. Let's analyze them:

*   **Pawn moves:** a7a6, a7a5, h5h6, h5g6, h5g5, h5f5, h5e5, h5d5, h5c5, h5h4, h5h3, h5h2, h5h1, b7c8, b7b8, b7a8, b7c7, b7a6. The pawn moves on h5 are interesting, but they don't immediately address the threats. The pawn moves on a7 are also not very effective. The pawn moves on b7 are potentially interesting.
*   **h5e8, h5f7:** These moves are captures with the pawn. Capturing the rook on f7 with the pawn on h5 is tempting, but it opens up the h-file and doesn't address the immediate threat of the queen.

Considering the position, the most pressing issue is the threat to the king. The best move is to move the pawn on h5 to block the queen's attack.

*   **b7c8, b7b8, b7a8:** These promote the pawn to a queen, rook, or bishop. Promoting to a queen is tempting, but it doesn't immediately solve the problems.
*   **b7a6, a7a6, a7a5:** These pawn moves don't seem to help much.
*   **h4d8, h4e7, h4f6, h4g5, h4h6, h4h5, h4h3, h4g3, h4h2, h4h1:** These are knight moves.

The best move seems to be to promote the pawn to a queen to defend the king.

Okay, I see the legal moves are d8d7, d8c7, and a4b3.

*   **d8d7:** Moving the queen to d7.
*   **d8c7:** Moving the queen to c7.
*   **a4b3:** Moving the pawn on a4 to b3.

The most active move seems to be developing the queen. I'll move the queen to c7, putting pressure on the white position.

You are a professional chess player and you play as black. Now is your turn to make a move. Before making a move you can pick one of the following actions:
- 'get_current_board' to get the schema and current status of the board
- 'get_legal_moves' to get a UCI formatted list of available moves
- 'make_move <UCI formatted move>' when you are ready to complete your turn (e.g., 'make_move e2e4')

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Okay, I have the legal moves: c7d8, c7b8, c7d7, and a4b3.

*   **c7d8:** This is a pawn promotion, and I can promote to a queen. This seems like the strongest move.
*   **c7b8:** This is also a pawn promotion, but to a knight. This is less powerful than promoting to a queen.
*   **c7d7:** This is a simple pawn move.
*   **a4b3:** This is a knight move.

Promoting to a queen is almost always the best option when possible. So, I will promote the pawn on c7 to a queen.

d8d7,d8c7,a4b3

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Okay, I have three legal moves: d8d7, d8c7, and a4b3. Let's analyze them.

*   **d8d7:** Moving the queen to d7 doesn't seem particularly active. It doesn't immediately threaten anything and just develops the queen.
*   **d8c7:** Moving the queen to c7 also develops the queen, but it also puts some pressure on the c-file and potentially eyes the weak pawn on c2.
*   **a4b3:** This is a pawn move. It doesn't seem to do much in this position.

Between d8c7 and d8d7, I think d8c7 is slightly better because it puts some pressure on the c-file.

I'll make the move d8c7.

Promoting the pawn to a queen (c7d8) seems like the most promising move. It immediately develops a powerful piece and puts pressure on the white king.

Okay, I see the board. Black's king is under some pressure. White has a rook on d4 and a knight on f6. Black has a pawn on c6. I need to find a move that addresses the immediate threat and improves my position. Let's see what moves are available.

d8e8,d8c8,d8d7,d8c7,b3b2

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Okay, I see the legal moves. The king has a few escape squares. Let's analyze them:

*   **d8e8:** Moves the king to e8. This seems like a reasonable escape, but it doesn't develop any pieces or create any counterplay.
*   **d8c8:** Moves the king to c8. This also seems like a safe square, but again, doesn't develop anything.
*   **d8d7:** Moves the king to d7. This is also a safe square.
*   **d8c7:** Moves the king to c7. This is also a safe square.
*   **b3b2:** This is not a valid move.

I think the best move is to move the king to d7. This gets the king out of the immediate line of fire and opens up the possibility of developing the pawn on c6.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, I have the legal moves. The pawn on d7 can move to e8, c8, c7, or e6.

Let's analyze these options:

*   **d7e8:** This promotes the pawn to a piece. Since the knight on h7 is undefended, promoting to a knight would be a good choice.
*   **d7c8:** This promotes the pawn to a piece. Promoting to a queen would be a good choice.
*   **d7c7:** This is a simple pawn move, but it doesn't seem to accomplish much immediately.
*   **d7e6:** This is a simple pawn move, but it doesn't seem to accomplish much immediately.

Promoting to a queen seems the best option, as it immediately threatens the king.

Okay, I have a few options. Let's analyze them.

*   **c8b8:** Moving the black bishop to b8. This doesn't seem particularly useful right now.
*   **c8c7:** Moving the black bishop to c7. This develops the bishop and potentially eyes the kingside.
*   **c8b7:** Moving the black bishop to b7. This develops the bishop and attacks the pawn on a6.
*   **b3b2:** Moving the black pawn to b2. This is the most aggressive move, potentially threatening a checkmate.

I think the most promising move is to develop the bishop and put some pressure on the white king. I'll choose c8b7.

*   **b8c8, b8a8, b8c7, b8b7, b8a7:** These are all moves with the black bishop.
*   **b3b2:** This is a pawn move.

Given the position, I want to put pressure on the white king. The pawn on b3 is a threat, but it doesn't immediately threaten the king. The bishop moves are more interesting. I think moving the bishop to c7 is the best move. It develops the bishop, controls important squares, and potentially eyes the white king.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, I have a good list of moves. Let's think about this. White has a solid pawn structure. I need to develop my pieces and challenge the center.

*   **...g8f6** is a standard developing move, bringing the knight to a good square.
*   **...e8d7** develops the queen, but it's a bit passive.
*   **...c8f5** looks interesting, developing the bishop and putting pressure on the f2 pawn.
*   **...h7h6** and **...g7g6** are pawn moves that don't really help my development.

I like the idea of developing the knight to f6. It controls central squares and prepares for further development.

I'll move the bishop from c8 to g4, attacking the knight on f3. This will put some pressure on white.

Alright, that's a lot of moves! Let's analyze them.

*   **Pawn moves:** The pawn moves are the most numerous. I need to consider which pawn structure I want to aim for. Pushing pawns in front of the king (h7h6, g7g6, etc.) can be useful for creating a pawn shield, but it can also weaken the king's position if not done carefully. Pushing the central pawns (e7e6, d5e4, c7c6, etc.) can challenge white's control of the center.

*   **Knight moves:** The knight moves are interesting. ...Ng8 is a developing move, but doesn't seem to have an immediate impact. ...Nd7 is also a developing move, but it might be better to keep the knight on f6 for now. ...Nc6 develops the knight to a good square, controlling important central squares. ...Ne4 seems like a good move to attack the pawn on f2.

*   **Queen moves:** The queen moves are not available.

*   **Bishop moves:** The bishop moves are not available.

*   **Rook moves:** The rook moves are not available.

*   **King moves:** The king moves are not available.

Considering the position, I think the best move is to develop the knight to c6. This controls important central squares and prepares for further development.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, I have a lot of options. White seems to be preparing an attack, so I need to be careful.

*   **Developing pieces:** I could develop the queen's bishop (f6) or the queen's rook (a8).
*   **Pawn structure:** I could advance pawns to control the center or support my pieces.
*   **Defensive moves:** I need to consider moves that defend against potential attacks.

Let's consider a few options:

*   **...h7-h6:** This seems like a solid, prophylactic move to prevent a potential white knight jump to g5. It also opens a potential escape square for the king.
*   **...e7-e6:** This supports the d5 pawn and prepares to develop the dark-squared bishop.
*   **...f6-e4:** This is a more aggressive move, attacking the white knight. However, it could leave the bishop exposed.
*   **...d8-d6:** This develops the queen and prepares to challenge the center.

I think **...h7-h6** is a good, solid move to start with. It doesn't commit me to anything too early and prepares for the future.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, I have a lot of options. Let's break this down.

*   **Pawn Moves:** I have several pawn moves available, but I want to be careful not to weaken my pawn structure too much. Moving the h-pawn to h5 seems like a good idea to challenge white's control of the h-file.
*   **Knight Moves:** My knights have some interesting options. ...Nf6-h5 looks good, attacking the g3 square.
*   **Bishop Moves:** My dark-squared bishop has a few options.
*   **Queen Moves:** My queen has a few options.
*   **Rook Moves:** My rooks have a few options.

Considering the position, I think the best move is to develop my knight to h5, attacking the g3 square and potentially disrupting white's plans.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, I have a lot of options. White's queen on d4 is a major threat. I need to consider how to deal with that.

*   **h8g8, h8h7:** These moves with the rook don't seem to help much immediately.
*   **e8d7, d8c8, d8b8, d8d7, d8c7, d8d6:** Queen moves. Qd7 looks interesting, getting the queen out of the pin and potentially eyeing the kingside.
*   **a8c8, a8b8:** Rook moves, not immediately helpful.
*   **c6b8, c6e5, c6a5, c6d4, c6b4:** Knight moves. Nc6 is a good developing move, but it doesn't address the immediate threat.
*   **h5f6, h5f4, h5g3:** Bishop moves. Bf6 could be interesting, but it doesn't seem to help much.
*   **g4c8, g4d7, g4e6, g4f5, g4h3, g4f3, g4e2:** Bishop moves.
*   **d5e4:** Pawn move. This opens the diagonal for the white bishop.
*   **g7g6, f7f6, e7e6, b7b6, a7a6, g7g5, f7f5, e7e5, b7b5, a7a5:** Pawn moves.

I think the best move here is to develop my queen and get it out of the pin while also potentially eyeing the kingside. **make_move d8d7**

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, I have a lot of options. Let's analyze a few of the more promising ones:

*   **h8g8:** Moving the rook to g8 doesn't seem to accomplish much immediately. It's a passive move.
*   **d7d6:** This looks like a good developing move, supporting the pawn structure and potentially opening the diagonal for the bishop on f8.
*   **d7e6:** This is also a developing move, but it blocks the diagonal for the bishop.
*   **g7g6:** This is a solid pawn move, preventing any potential white knight jumps to f5.
*   **f7f6:** Similar to g7g6, this supports the pawn structure.
*   **e7e6:** This is a good developing move, supporting the pawn structure and potentially opening the diagonal for the bishop on f8.
*   **c6d4:** This looks interesting. It attacks the white knight on e5.

I think **d7d6** is the best move here. It develops a piece, supports the pawn structure, and prepares for further development.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, that's a lot of moves. Let's analyze them.

*   **King moves (h8g8, h8h7, e8d7):** Moving the king is generally not a priority unless absolutely necessary. h8g8 looks like a possible escape route, but it's not urgent.
*   **Rook moves (a8d8, a8c8, a8b8):** These don't seem to immediately improve the position.
*   **Queen moves (d6d8, d6d7, d6c7, d6g6, d6f6, d6e6, d6e5, d6c5, d6f4, d6b4, d6g3, d6a3, d6h2):** The queen is the most powerful piece. Many of these moves are worth investigating.
*   **Knight moves (c6d8, c6b8, c6e5, c6a5, c6d4, c6b4):** The knight on c6 is well-placed.
*   **Bishop moves (h5f6, h5f4, h5g3):** The bishop on h5 is somewhat restricted.
*   **Pawn moves (g7g6, f7f6, e7e6, b7b6, a7a6, g7g5, f7f5, e7e5, b7b5, a7a5):** Pawn moves are generally less impactful in the short term.

**My Plan:**

White's queen is a threat. I need to develop my pieces and challenge the center. I'm particularly interested in moves that:

1.  **Develop a piece:** The knight on c6 is already well placed.
2.  **Control the center:**
3.  **Challenge the white queen:**

**Considering the options:**

*   **...Qd7:** This develops the queen and attacks the white queen. It also defends the king. This looks like a strong move.
*   **...Ne5:** This attacks the white queen and develops the knight.
*   **...g6:** This prepares to fianchetto the bishop on h8.

I think ...Qd7 is the most direct and active response.

Alright, I've got a lot of options. White's queen on d4 is a major threat. I need to consider how to defend against that.

*   **h8g8, h8h7, e8d8, a8d8, a8c8, a8b8, d7d8, d7c8, d7c7, d7e6, d7d6, d7f5:** These moves with the rooks and queen don't seem to immediately address the threat.
*   **c6d8, c6b8, c6e5, c6a5, c6d4, c6b4:** The knight moves are interesting. Nc6-d4 would directly attack the queen, but it opens up a pin on my knight. Nc6-e5 looks like a good developing move.
*   **h5f6, h5f4, h5g3, g4e6, g4f5, g4h3, g4f3:** These pawn moves don't seem to help.
*   **e8c8:** Moving the king doesn't seem necessary right now.
*   **d5e4:** This pawn move doesn't seem to help.
*   **g7g6, f7f6, e7e6, b7b6, a7a6, g7g5, f7f5, e7e5, b7b5, a7a5:** These pawn moves are mostly passive.

Nc6-e5 looks like the best move. It develops the knight to a good square, attacks the queen, and prepares to challenge white's control of the center.

Okay, I see the board. Black's king is on e8, and white's king is on e1. Black has a queen on d7, and white has a queen on d4. It looks like white has a strong attack developing. I need to find a move that addresses the immediate threats and develops my pieces.

Let's get a list of legal moves.

h8g8,h8h7,e8d8,a8d8,a8c8,a8b8,d7d8,d7c8,d7c7,d7e6,d7d6,d7c6,d7f5,d7b5,d7a4,h5f6,h5f4,h5g3,g4e6,g4f5,g4h3,g4f3,e8c8,d5e4,g7g6,f7f6,e7e6,b7b6,a7a6,d5d4,g7g5,f7f5,b7b5,a7a5

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Okay, that's a lot of moves. Let's analyze them. White's queen on d4 is a major threat. I need to consider moves that defend against it or develop a counterattack.

*   **Queen moves:** Qd8, Qc8, Qc7, Qe6, Qd6, Qc6, Qf5, Qb5, Qa4 - These are all possible queen moves. Qd8 develops the queen, but doesn't immediately address the threat. Qc7 and Qc6 look interesting, as they put pressure on the white queen. Qe6 attacks the white knight.
*   **Pawn moves:** g6, f6, e6, b6, a6, g5, f5, b5, a5 - These are mostly pawn moves that don't seem to immediately improve my position.
*   **Other moves:** h7, h5f6, h5f4, h5g3, g4e6, g4f5, g4h3, g4f3 - These moves are less relevant.

I'm leaning towards **Qc7**. This move attacks the white queen, forces a response, and develops my queen to a more active square.

Okay, I see the legal moves. Let's analyze them:

*   **e8d8:** Moving the Queen to d8 doesn't seem to help much. It doesn't develop any pieces or defend the King directly.
*   **c7d7:** Moving the pawn on c7 to d7 is not a good move.
*   **c7c6:** This move defends the queen and opens a line for the bishop.
*   **g4d7:** This move is not possible.

The best move here seems to be **c7c6**. This defends the Queen and opens a diagonal for the Bishop.

*   **King Safety:** Moving the King doesn't seem immediately helpful.
*   **Defense:** I need to block the attack. The Queen on c6 is key.
*   **Development:** I need to get my pieces into the game.

Considering the threats, I think the most important thing is to develop my Queen to a more active square and defend against the immediate threats. **Qc7** looks like a good move. It defends the King, develops the Queen, and prepares to potentially counterattack.

Alright, I have a lot of options. White is threatening a lot, especially with the Queen and Bishop on the e-file.

My priorities are:

1.  **Defend my King:** The immediate threat is probably the Bishop on f1 and the Queen on d2.
2.  **Develop pieces:** Get my pieces active to counterattack.
3.  **Control the center:** Try to challenge White's central control.

Considering these factors, I think the best move is to develop my Queen's Bishop to a more active square and defend the potential threats.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, I have a lot of options. Let's analyze the position. White's queen is aggressively placed, and my king is somewhat exposed. I need to develop my pieces and try to create some counterplay.

The move ...d6d7 looks passive. ...h8h7 is also not very active. ...c8d7 develops the bishop, but doesn't immediately address the threat. ...a8b8 is also passive.

...g7g6 prepares to fianchetto the bishop, but it's slow. ...f7f6 is similar. ...e7e6 is a solid move, but doesn't do much to develop. ...b7b6 is also a bit slow.

...d6e5 looks interesting, attacking the queen and opening the diagonal for the bishop. However, the knight on f3 could then attack the queen.

...d6c6 is a possibility, developing the queen and attacking the knight.

...g7g5 is a more aggressive move, challenging white's control of the center.

Considering the position, I think ...g7g5 is the most active and promising move. It challenges the center and opens lines for my pieces.

Alright, I have a good list of moves. Let's analyze. The Black Queen on d6 is a key piece. I see a few interesting options.

*   **...Qg6** attacks the White Knight on f3 and prepares to put pressure on the kingside.
*   **...Qe5** attacks the White Queen and opens up the diagonal for the Black Bishop on f8.
*   **...f7f6** supports the pawn structure.

I like the look of ...Qg6. It creates immediate threats and forces White to react.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, I've got a lot of options. White's threats are: Qf6+, and potentially a rook lift to the h-file. I need to consider the following:

*   **King safety:** The immediate threat is the Queen on f6.
*   **Development:** Black is underdeveloped.
*   **Counterplay:** I need to create some threats of my own.

Let's analyze some of the moves:

*   **h8g8:** Moving the rook doesn't help much.
*   **h8h7:** Doesn't help with the immediate threats.
*   **f8g7:** Develops the Bishop, but doesn't address the immediate threat.
*   **c8d7:** Develops the Queen, but doesn't address the immediate threat.
*   **g6g8:** Moving the pawn doesn't help.
*   **h5f6:** This looks interesting. It attacks the rook and blocks the Queen's attack.

I think h5f6 is the best move. It blocks the check, attacks the rook, and opens up the h-file for a potential counterattack.

Okay, I see the board. White has a strong attack developing. My king is a bit exposed. I need to defend and develop. Let's see what my legal moves are.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Okay, I have a lot of options. White's queen on c3 is a threat, and the knight on f6 is also under pressure. I need to address these issues.

*   **h8g8, h8h7:** Moving the rook doesn't seem to help much right now.
*   **f8g7:** Developing the bishop looks reasonable.
*   **g6g8, g6h7, g6g7, g6h5, g6f5, g6e4, g6d3, g6c2:** These are all knight moves. The knight on g6 is under attack. Moving it to h5 or f5 seems to be the most active.
*   **f6g8, f6e8, f6h7, f6d7, f6h5, f6g4, f6e4:** These are knight moves. The knight on f6 is also under attack. Moving it to h5 seems like a good option.
*   **g5h4, g5f4:** These are pawn moves.
*   **d5c4:** This pawn move doesn't seem to help.
*   **e7e6, b7b6, a7a6, h6h5, g5g4, d5d4, b7b5:** These are pawn moves.

I think the best move is to develop the knight on f6 to h5. This defends the knight on g6, attacks the white queen, and prepares to develop the knight further.

*   **g5h4, g5f4:** Moving the pawn on g5 doesn't seem to help much against the immediate threats.
*   **d5c4:** Moving the pawn on d5 doesn't seem to help much against the immediate threats.
*   **f7f6, e7e6, b7b6, a7a6:** These pawn moves are passive and don't address the immediate threats.
*   **g5g4:** Moving the pawn on g5 doesn't seem to help much against the immediate threats.
*   **d5d4:** Moving the pawn on d5 doesn't seem to help much against the immediate threats.
*   **f7f5:** This pawn move opens up the position and could be dangerous.
*   **b7b5:** This pawn move doesn't seem to help much against the immediate threats.

The best move seems to be to develop the knight and attack the queen.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, that's a lot of moves. Let's analyze them.

*   **King moves (h8g8, h8h7):** Moving the King doesn't seem to improve the situation significantly, and might even make it worse.
*   **Bishop moves (f8g7):** Developing the Bishop is a good idea, but g7 doesn't seem to help much.
*   **Pawn moves (f7f6, e7e6, b7b6, a7a6, h6h5, g5g4, d5d4, f7f5, b7b5):** These pawn moves are mostly defensive, but some might open lines for the attack.
*   **Queen moves (g6g8, g6h7, g6g7, g6f6, g6e6, g6d6, g6c6, g6b6, g6a6, g6h5, g6f5, g6e4, g6d3):** The Queen is the most active piece. Moving the Queen is the most important thing to do.
*   **Knight moves (f4e6, f4h5, f4h3, f4d3, f4g2, f4e2):** The knight is not well placed.
*   **Pawn moves (g5h4, d5c4):** These pawn moves are not good.

The most pressing threat is the White Queen on c3. I need to find a way to defend against the attack.

After considering all the moves, I think the best move is to develop the Queen and attack the white Queen.

Okay, I have a lot of options. White is threatening a lot. Let's analyze a bit.

*   **Defensive moves:** `h8g8` (moving the rook) doesn't seem to help much. `f7f6` and `e7e6` are passive.
*   **Developing moves:** `f4g6`, `f4e6`, `f4h5`, `f4h3`, `f4d3`, `f4g2`, `f4e2` are all moves with the bishop. `g5h4` is a pawn move.
*   **Pawn moves:** `f7f6`, `e7e6`, `b7b6`, `a7a6`, `h6h5`, `g5g4`, `d5d4`, `f7f5`, `b7b5` are all pawn moves.

The most active move seems to be developing the bishop. I think I'll develop my bishop to e6, challenging the center and potentially eyeing the weak f7 square.

*   **Bishop moves:** The bishop on f8 has a few options.
*   **Rook moves:** The rooks on a8 and h8 have limited options.
*   **King moves:** The king has no immediate moves.
*   **Knight moves:** The knight on g5 has a few options.

*   **Defensive moves:** I need to consider moves that directly address the threat to my king.

*   **e6f8, e6d8, e6c7, e6c5, e6f4, e6d4:** These moves with the Bishop are not good.

*   **h8g8, h8f8, h8e8, h8d8, h8c8:** These moves with the Rook are not good.
*   **b8c8, b8c7:** These moves with the Rook are not good.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, I've got the legal moves. Let's analyze them. White's queen and rook are posing a threat on the h-file. The bishop on f8 is currently blocked. I need to find a move that helps defend the king and potentially develop my pieces.

*   **h8g8, h8f8, h8e8, h8d8, h8c8:** Moving the rook doesn't seem to immediately solve the problem.
*   **h8h7:** This seems like a reasonable defensive move, preventing a potential checkmate threat.
*   **b8c8, b8c7:** Moving the bishop doesn't seem to help the immediate situation.
*   **g7f8, g7f6, g7e5:** Moving the knight doesn't seem to help the immediate situation.
*   **e6f8, e6d8, e6c7, e6c5, e6f4, e6d4:** Moving the pawn doesn't seem to help the immediate situation.
*   **f5h7, f5g6, f5f6, f5e5, f5g4, f5f4, f5e4, f5h3, f5f3, f5f2, f5f1:** Moving the pawn doesn't seem to help the immediate situation.
*   **g5h4:** Moving the pawn doesn't seem to help the immediate situation.
*   **d5e4, d5d4:** Moving the pawn doesn't seem to help the immediate situation.
*   **f7f6, b7b6, a7a6, h6h5, g5g4, d5d4:** Moving the pawn doesn't seem to help the immediate situation.

The most pressing issue seems to be the potential threat on the h-file. Moving the rook to h7 seems like the best defensive option.

Alright, I've got the legal moves. The position is very tactical. White has a strong attack. I need to find a move that defends and creates some counterplay.

Let's analyze a few options:

*   **...g7f6:** This develops the bishop, but it doesn't immediately address the threats.
*   **...f7f6:** This blocks the white queen's attack on the h6 pawn, but it weakens the kingside.
*   **...d5d4:** This challenges the center and opens lines for the queen.

Considering the threats and the need for counterplay, I think the best move is to challenge the center with ...d5d4.

*   **Pawn moves:** Pushing pawns doesn't seem to directly address the immediate threat.
*   **Knight moves:** The knight on f4 has some interesting options, but none immediately block the queen.
*   **Bishop moves:** The bishop on g7 has a few moves, but none seem to help.
*   **Rook moves:** The rook on h8 has a few moves, but none seem to help.
*   **Queen moves:** The queen on d4 has a few moves, but none seem to help.

The most pressing issue is the threat to my king. I need to find a move that defends against the queen. The move **g7f6** looks like a good developing move that also defends the king.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, I've got the legal moves. White is clearly attacking, and I need to defend. Let's analyze the options:

*   **Pawn moves:** `b7b6`, `a7a6`, `h7h8`, `h7g7`, `h7f7`, `h7e7`, `h6g5`, `h6h5`, `b7b5`, `f4g5`, `f4e5`, `f4h4`, `f4g4`, `f4e4`, `f4g3`, `f4f3`, `f4e3`, `f4f2`, `f4f1`, `d4e3`, `d4d3`, `d4c3` - These pawn moves don't seem to directly address the immediate threats. Some might be useful later, but not now.
*   **Knight moves:** `f6h8`, `f6g7`, `f6e7`, `f6g5`, `f6e5`, `c7e8`, `c7e6`, `c7a6`, `c7d5`, `c7b5` - The knight moves are more interesting. `f6g5` attacks the white queen, which is good. `c7e6` could help defend.
*   **Other moves:** `b8c8` - This seems like a passive move.

Considering the threats, I think the best move is to develop the knight and attack the white queen.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Okay, I have the list of legal moves. The position is quite complex. Black's queen is under attack, and white has a strong attack brewing. I need to find a move that addresses the immediate threat and also improves Black's position.

Let's analyze the options:

*   **Defensive moves:**
    *   `h7h8`: Promotes the pawn, but it's not clear what the best promotion is.
    *   `b7b6`, `a7a6`, `h6h5`: These are passive moves that don't address the immediate threat.
*   **Queen moves:**
    *   `c7e8`: This seems like a reasonable escape for the queen.
    *   `c7e6`, `c7a6`, `c7d5`, `c7b5`: These moves don't seem to improve the position.
*   **Other moves:**
    *   `g5e7`, `g5f6`, `g5h4`: These moves with the knight don't seem to help.
    *   `f4e5`, `f4h4`, `f4g4`, `f4e4`, `f4g3`, `f4f3`, `f4e3`, `f4f2`, `f4d2`, `f4f1`, `f4c1`: These moves with the bishop don't seem to help.
    *   `b7b5`: This move doesn't seem to help.

I think the best move is to move the queen to e8. This gets the queen out of the attack and also opens up the h-file for the rook.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Okay, I have a lot of options. Let's break this down.

*   **King moves:** e8g7, e8c7, e8f6, e8d6. These moves look risky, as they don't really improve the king's safety and might expose it further.
*   **Knight moves:** b8c8. This doesn't seem to achieve much.
*   **Pawn moves:** h7h8, h7g7, h7f7, h7e7, b7b6, a7a6, h6h5, d4d3, b7b5. Pushing the h-pawn seems pointless. b7b6 and a7a6 are passive. d4d3 looks interesting, but it might weaken my pawn structure. b7b5 is a more active pawn move.
*   **Bishop moves:** g5e7, g5f6, g5h4. The bishop on g5 is a key defender. g5f6 looks like a good developing move, attacking the white queen.
*   **Pawn moves:** f4e5, f4h4, f4g4, f4e4, f4g3, f4f3, f4e3, f4f2, f4d2, f4f1, f4c1. These are all pawn moves.

Considering the position, I think the best move is to develop my bishop and attack the white queen.

Okay, I have a list of legal moves. I need to find the one that gets my king out of check.

Looking at the moves, I see:

*   `g7e8`: This moves the pawn on g7 to e8 and promotes it to a queen. This would block the check.

Therefore, I will make the move `g7e8`.

Alright, I have a list of legal moves. The king has several escape squares. Let's analyze them:

*   **e8g7:** Moving the king to g7. This looks like a safe square.
*   **e8c7:** Moving the king to c7. This looks like a safe square.
*   **e8f6:** Moving the king to f6. This looks like a safe square.
*   **e8d6:** Moving the king to d6. This looks like a safe square.

Since all of the king moves seem safe, I'll choose the one that develops the king towards the center of the board.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, I have a list of legal moves. Let's analyze them.

*   **Pawn moves:** I have pawn moves available on the h, a, and b files. The h-pawn can move to h8, g7, f7, e7, d7, and c7. The a-pawn can move to a6. The b-pawn can move to b6 or b5.
*   **Knight moves:** The knight on d6 has several options: e8, c8, f7, b5, e4, c4.
*   **Bishop moves:** The bishop on e5 has several options: h8, g7, f6, f4, d4, c3, b2.
*   **Rook moves:** The rook on b7 has no moves.

Considering the position, I want to develop my pieces and control the center. The knight on d6 is well-placed. I'll consider the following:

*   **d6-f7:** This move develops the knight to a more active square and potentially attacks the pawn on g5.
*   **d6-e4:** This move attacks the pawn on f2 and opens the diagonal for the bishop.
*   **b7-b5:** This move challenges white's control of the center.

I think **d6-e4** is the most promising move. It immediately creates a threat and opens lines for my pieces.

Alright, I have a few options. White's queen is a threat, and I need to address that. Moving the pawn on e5 seems like a good idea to defend the king. Let's consider the possibilities:

*   **e5f6**: This blocks the queen's attack on the king, but it also opens up the f-file.
*   **e5d6**: This also blocks the queen, but it doesn't seem as strong.
*   **e5f4**: This attacks the knight, but it doesn't directly address the immediate threat.
*   **e5d4**: This also attacks the knight.

I think **e5f6** is the best move. It directly defends the king and doesn't give up any material.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Okay, I've got the legal moves. Let's analyze them.

*   **Pawn moves:** h7h8, h7g7, h7f7, h7e7, h7d7, h7c7, b7b6, a7a6, b7b5. The pawn on h7 can promote to a queen, rook, bishop, or knight. The pawn on b7 can advance. The pawn on a7 can advance.
*   **Knight moves:** f6h8, f6d8, f6g7, f6e7, f6g5, f6e5, f6h4, f6d4, f6c3, f6b2. The knight on f6 has a lot of options.
*   **Queen moves:** d3e2. The queen on c3 has a lot of options.

The most pressing issue is the threat to the black king. The white rook on b6 is attacking the king. I need to address this immediately. The knight on f6 can move to d8, e7, g7, h4, d4, c3, b2. The pawn on h7 can promote to a queen.

I think the best move is to move the knight to d4 to defend the king.

I think I'll play **b7b5**. This challenges white's control of the center and prepares for further development.

Okay, I see the board. Black's king is exposed, and white has a queen actively positioned. I need to find a move that addresses the immediate threats and develops my pieces. Let's see what moves are available.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, I've got a list of legal moves. The most pressing issue is the threat to my king. I need to consider moves that defend against the queen and develop my pieces.

*   **h7h8**: This promotes the pawn to a queen, which could be useful, but doesn't immediately address the threat to the king.
*   **e4f6**: This attacks the queen, which is a good idea.
*   **d4f6**: This also attacks the queen.
*   **d3e2**: This moves the pawn, but doesn't seem to help much.
*   **b8c7, b8b7**: These moves develop the rook, but don't address the immediate threat.
*   **a7a6, b5b4**: These are pawn moves that don't seem to help.

Between e4f6 and d4f6, I prefer **e4f6** because it develops a piece and attacks the queen.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, I've got the legal moves. Let's analyze them.

*   **Pawn moves:** I have a lot of pawn moves available. `h7h8` is a promotion, but it's not immediately useful. `a7a6` and `b5b4` are standard pawn moves. `d4e5` and `d4c5` attack the center. `d3d2` is a pawn move.
*   **Knight moves:** The knight on f6 has several options: `f6g8`, `f6e8`, `f6d7`, `f6h5`, `f6d5`, `f6g4`, `f6e4`.
*   **Other moves:** I have a rook on a8 and a rook on h8.

The position is complex. I need to consider a few things:

*   **White's Queen:** The queen on e5 is a threat.
*   **My King:** My king is relatively safe.
*   **Development:** I need to develop my pieces.

I think the most active move is to develop the knight and attack the queen.

*   **Pawn moves:** `h7h8`, `h7g7`, `h7f7`, `h7e7`, `a7a6`, `b5b4`, `d3d2` - These are mostly defensive or developing moves. `h7h8` is a promotion, but it's not immediately clear what to promote to.
*   **Knight moves:** `d5e7`, `d5c7`, `d5f6`, `d5b6`, `d5f4`, `d5b4`, `d5e3`, `d5c3` - The knight on d5 has many options.
*   **Bishop moves:** `d4h8`, `d4g7`, `d4f6`, `d4e5`, `d4c5`, `d4e3`, `d4c3`, `d4b2` - The bishop on d4 also has many options.
*   **Rook moves:** `b8c8` - This is a rook move.

The immediate threat is the white queen. I need to address that.

*   **`d5f6`** - This looks interesting. The knight attacks the queen and develops a piece.

Let's go with that.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Okay, I've got the list of legal moves. The most pressing concern is the queen's attack on the h-file. I need to consider how to defend against that.

*   **h7h8**: This promotes the pawn to a queen, but it doesn't immediately address the threat and might even worsen the position.
*   **h7g7, h7f7, h7e7**: These are pawn moves that don't help.
*   **f6g8, f6e8, f6d7, f6h5, f6d5, f6g4, f6e4**: These are knight moves. The knight on f6 is currently defending the king. Moving it away would be very risky.
*   **d4e5, d4c5, d4e3, d4c3, d4b2**: These are pawn moves.
*   **a7a6, b5b4**: These are pawn moves.
*   **d3d2**: This is a pawn move.

The most promising move seems to be to move the pawn on d4 to d3, blocking the queen's attack and potentially opening up a line for the bishop.

Okay, I see the legal moves again. I made a mistake in my initial assessment. The pawn on d4 is not on d3. My previous move was invalid. Let's re-evaluate.

The queen on e7 is a major threat. I need to find a way to address it. The knight on f6 is defending the king, but it's also somewhat passive.

*   **h7h8**: Promote the pawn. Not helpful.
*   **f6g8, f6e8, f6d7, f6h5, f6d5, f6g4, f6e4**: Knight moves. Moving the knight away from the defense of the king is risky.
*   **d4e5, d4c5, d4e3, d4c3, d4b2**: Pawn moves. These don't directly address the threat.
*   **a7a6, b5b4**: Pawn moves.
*   **d3d2**: This pawn move seems like the best option. It blocks the queen's attack on the h-file and opens up a line for the bishop on c8.

*   **Develop the rook:** Moving the rook on a8 to a more active square seems like a good idea.
*   **Pawn moves:** Pushing the pawn on b5 can open the position.
*   **Knight moves:** The knight on f6 has a few options.
*   **Queen promotion:** The pawn on d2 can promote to a queen, rook, bishop or knight.

Given the position, I think developing the rook to h8 is a good start. It defends the back rank and potentially opens a line for the rook to attack.

Okay, I see the legal moves. The rook on h8 has many options, but it's blocked by the king. The pawn on c7 can move to c6 or c8. The knight on f6 has some interesting moves. The pawn on d4 can move. The pawn on b5 can move. The pawn on d2 can promote.

The immediate threat is the rook on h8. I can move the king out of check.

Let's move the king to g8.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, I've got the legal moves. The most pressing issue is the exposed king. White has a rook on h8 and another on a8, and the king is somewhat trapped. I need to find a move that improves the king's safety and develops a piece.

Looking at the moves, I see a few options. Moving the rook on g8 doesn't seem to help much immediately. The pawn moves don't seem to address the king safety directly. The knight on f6 has a few interesting options. I think the best move here is to move the knight to d7. This defends the king from a potential check by the rook on h8 and also develops the knight to a more active square.

Alright, I've got a lot of options. Let's analyze them.

*   **Rook moves (g8):** Moving the rook on g8 doesn't seem to immediately improve the position.
*   **Pawn moves (h7):** h7-h8 is a promotion, but it doesn't seem to help much right now.
*   **Knight moves (d7):** The knight on d7 has some interesting options. Nf6 attacks the pawn on e4 and defends the king. Nb6 attacks the pawn on c4. Ne5 attacks the pawn on f3.
*   **Pawn moves (c7):** c7-c6 is a solid developing move.
*   **Bishop moves (d4):** The bishop on d4 has some interesting options. Bf6 attacks the pawn on e4 and defends the king. Be5 attacks the pawn on f3. Bc3 attacks the pawn on b2.
*   **Pawn moves (d2):** This is a pawn promotion.

The most pressing issue is the king's safety. Nf6 looks like a good move to defend the king and attack the pawn on e4.

Alright, I've got a lot of options. Let's break this down.

*   **Pawn moves:** I have pawns on g7, c7, and d4. The g7 pawn has a lot of promotion options, but it's blocked by the king. The c7 pawn can promote. The d4 pawn can move forward or capture.
*   **Knight moves:** The knight on f6 has a few options.
*   **Queen moves:** No queen on the board.
*   **Bishop moves:** No bishop on the board.
*   **Rook moves:** No rook on the board.
*   **King moves:** The king is on c8.

The most pressing issue is the pawn on g7. It's about to promote. I should promote it to a queen.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, I have a lot of options. The immediate threats are the rooks on the back rank. I need to address the king's safety. Moving the rook on g8 seems like the most pressing concern. I can move it to g7, which defends the king and potentially opens up a line for the rook. Let's try that.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, I've got a lot of options. Let's break this down.

*   **Pawn moves:** g7 can promote, and there are a lot of pawn moves.
*   **Knight moves:** The knight on f6 has several options.
*   **Bishop moves:** The bishop on e3 has some diagonal moves.
*   **Queen moves:** The queen on d2 has a lot of moves.

The most pressing issue is the checkmate threat. White's rook on h8 is a serious problem. I need to address this immediately.

The best move here is to promote the pawn on g7 to a queen. This will block the checkmate threat and also give me a powerful piece.

Alright, I've got a list of legal moves. Let's analyze them. The rook on h8 has a lot of options, but moving it doesn't seem immediately helpful. The pawn on c7 can promote, but that's not the best option right now. The knight on f6 has some interesting possibilities. The pawn on g6 has a lot of moves. The bishop on e3 has a few options.

I think the best move here is to develop the knight on f6. I'll move it to h5, attacking the pawn on g7 and potentially opening up lines for my pieces.

Okay, I see the board. White has a strong attack developing, and my king is a little exposed. I need to be careful. Let's get a list of my legal moves.

h7h8,h7g7,h7f7,h7e7,h7d7,c7d8,c7c8,c7b8,c7d6,c7b6,g6g8,g6g7,g6f6,g6e6,g6d6,g6c6,g6g5,g6g4,g6g3,g6g2,g6g1,h5g7,h5f6,h5f4,h5g3,e3b6,e3c5,e3f4,e3d4,e3f2,e3d2,e3g1,e3c1,d1d8,d1d7,d1d6,d1d5,d1g4,d1d4,d1a4,d1f3,d1d3,d1b3,d1e2,d1d2,d1c2,d1h1,d1g1,d1f1,d1e1,d1c1,d1b1,d1a1

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Okay, that's a lot of moves. Let's analyze them.

*   **Pawn moves:** I have several pawn moves. `h7h8` is a promotion, but it doesn't seem immediately helpful. `c7d8` is also a promotion. `g6` pawns have a lot of options.

*   **Knight moves:** The knight on h5 has several options.

*   **Bishop moves:** The bishop on e3 has a lot of options.

*   **Queen moves:** The queen on d1 has a lot of options.

I need to prioritize defending my king and developing my pieces. The immediate threat seems to be from the white queen and rooks.

Let's consider a few options:

*   **...Qg4:** This attacks the white rook on h1, and potentially opens up lines for my queen. This looks like a good developing move.

I will make the move Qg4.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Okay, I have a lot of options. The most pressing issue is the threat to f7. I can move my pawn on h7 to h8 and promote it to a queen, which would be a good defensive move. I can also move my pawn on g6. Let's see...

*   **h7h8=Q:** This seems like the most solid move. It creates a queen to defend.
*   **g6g5:** This doesn't immediately address the threat.
*   **Other pawn moves:** They don't help.
*   **Knight moves:** The knight moves don't help defend f7.
*   **Bishop moves:** The bishop moves don't help defend f7.

I'm going to promote the pawn to a queen to defend.

Looking at the moves, `g6g5` seems interesting. It attacks the white queen. This might force White to react and give me a little breathing room. It also opens the g-file, potentially for a rook to join the defense.

Let's try `g6g5`.

Alright, I've got a lot of options. The most pressing concern is the attack on my king. I need to find a move that addresses this. Let's analyze some of the moves.

*   **h7h8=Q/R/B/N:** Promoting the pawn to a queen, rook, bishop, or knight. This is a tempting option, but it doesn't immediately solve the king safety issue.
*   **c6d7, c6b6, c6d5, c6c5, c6b5:** These pawn moves don't seem to help much.
*   **h5g7, h5f6, h5f4, h5g3:** These knight moves are interesting, but they don't directly address the threat.
*   **g5g8=Q/R/B/N, g5g7, g5g6:** Promoting the pawn on g5 is a possibility.
*   **g4h4, g4f4, g4h3, g4g3, g4f3, g4g2, g4e2, g4g1, g4d1:** These pawn moves don't seem to help.
*   **e3b6, e3c5, e3f4, e3d4, e3f2, e3d2, e3g1, e3c1:** These bishop moves are interesting.

The most promising move seems to be to try and create some counterplay. Promoting the g pawn to a queen looks like the best option to create some counterplay.

Okay, I see the board. Black's king is exposed. White has a strong attack. I need to find a move that addresses the immediate threats and tries to develop a counterplay. Let's see the legal moves.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Okay, I see the legal moves. The most pressing threat is the potential checkmate. I need to find a move that defends against the immediate threats and develops a counterplay.

*   **c6d7**: This move moves the pawn, but doesn't seem to help much.
*   **c6b6**: This move moves the pawn, but doesn't seem to help much.
*   **c6c5**: This move moves the pawn, but doesn't seem to help much.
*   **c6b5**: This move moves the pawn, but doesn't seem to help much.
*   **f5e4**: This move attacks the bishop and opens a line for the queen. This seems like the best move.

I will play f5e4.

The pawn moves don't seem immediately impactful. The rook moves look interesting. Let's consider the rook moves.

I will move the pawn.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Okay, I've got the legal moves. The most pressing issue is the threat to my king. White's queen on g4 is a major problem. I need to find a way to address that.

Let's analyze the options:

*   **h7h8=Q/R/B/N:** Promoting the pawn doesn't immediately help.
*   **g7g8=Q/R/B/N:** Promoting the pawn doesn't immediately help.
*   **g7f7, g7e7, g7d7, g7c7, g7b7, g7a7:** These pawn moves don't address the immediate threat.
*   **g7g6, g7g5:** These pawn moves don't address the immediate threat.
*   **h5f6, h5f4, h5g3:** The knight moves don't help.
*   **c5b6, c5c4, c5b4:** These pawn moves don't address the immediate threat.
*   **g4c8, g4d7, g4g6, g4e6, g4g5, g4f5, g4h4, g4f4, g4h3, g4g3, g4f3, g4g2, g4e2, g4g1, g4d1:** These are all the queen's moves.
*   **e3f4, e3d4, e3f2, e3d2, e3g1, e3c1:** These are the bishop's moves.

The only move that seems to offer any immediate defense is to move the bishop to block the queen's attack.

I'll move the bishop to f4, blocking the queen's attack on the king.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, I have the list of legal moves. Let's analyze them. Black has a lot of options here.

*   **Pawn moves:** The pawn moves are the most numerous. Pushing the pawns on the g, f, d, c, b, and a files one or two squares is possible.
*   **Knight moves:** The knight on g8 can move to e7, h6, or f6. The knight on b8 can move to c6 or a6.
*   **Bishop moves:** The bishop on f8 has a wide range of diagonal moves.
*   **Queen moves:** The queen on d8 can move to e7, f6, g5, or h4.
*   **King moves:** The king on e8 can move to e7.

Considering the position, I want to develop a piece and control the center. Pushing the e-pawn is a good idea, but it's not available. I think I'll develop the knight to f6. This controls important central squares and prepares for further development.

That's a lot of options! Let's analyze. The most immediate threats seem to be the potential for white to develop their queen and attack my king. I need to develop my pieces and control the center.

I'll start by developing my knight to c6, controlling a central square and preparing to challenge white's control of the center.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, I have a lot of options. Let's break this down. White has pushed their e-pawn, and I need to react to that. I see a few possibilities:

*   **Developing my Queen's Bishop:** Moves like ...Bf8-e7, ...Bf8-d6, or ...Bf8-c5 look interesting, aiming to control the center.
*   **Developing my Queen:** ...Qd8-e7 or ...Qd8-d7 are also possible.
*   **Pawn moves:** ...h7-h6, ...g7-g6, ...b7-b6, ...a7-a6 are all standard pawn moves, but don't immediately address the central tension.
*   **Knight moves:** ...Nf6-g8, ...Nf6-d7, ...Nf6-h5, ...Nf6-g4, ...Nf6-e4. Some of these look a bit passive.

I like the idea of developing my Queen's Bishop to control the center. ...Bf8-e7 seems like a solid developing move, preparing to challenge White's control of the center.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, I have a lot of options. White's queen is a threat, so I need to be careful. Let's consider some of the more active moves.

*   **...e8d7**: This develops the queen and gets it off the back rank. It also potentially opens the diagonal for the bishop on c8.
*   **...h7h6**: This prevents a potential white pawn push to h5, which could be annoying.
*   **...g7g6**: Similar to h7h6, this prepares to control the center.
*   **...d8d7**: This develops the queen and gets it off the back rank.

I think developing the queen is a good idea. I'll choose ...Qd7 to develop the queen and open up the diagonal for my light-squared bishop.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, that's a lot of moves to consider. White is threatening the black king, so I need to prioritize defense. Let's analyze the options:

*   **Defensive Moves:**
    *   `h7h6` and `h7h5`: These pawn moves don't seem to help much against the immediate threats.
    *   `g7g6` and `g7g5`: Same as above.
    *   `b7b6` and `b7b5`: These pawn moves don't seem to help much against the immediate threats.
    *   `e7d6`, `e7c5`, `e7b4`, `e7a3`: These bishop moves look interesting, but they don't directly address the threat.
    *   `d7e6`, `d7d6`: These pawn moves don't seem to help much against the immediate threats.
    *   `f6g8`, `f6e8`, `f6h5`, `f6g4`, `f6e4`: These knight moves don't seem to help much against the immediate threats.
    *   `c6b8`, `c6a7`, `c6a5`, `c6d4`, `c6b4`: These knight moves don't seem to help much against the immediate threats.
    *   `d8g8`, `d8f8`, `d8e8`: These queen moves don't seem to help much against the immediate threats.
    *   `a8b8`, `a8a7`: These rook moves don't seem to help much against the immediate threats.
    *   `h8g8`, `h8f8`, `h8e8`: These rook moves don't seem to help much against the immediate threats.
    *   `e5e4`, `d5d4`: These pawn moves don't seem to help much against the immediate threats.
    *   `e7f8`: This bishop move looks interesting, but it doesn't directly address the threat.

*   **Prioritizing Defense:**

The most pressing threat seems to be the white queen. I need to find a move that either blocks the queen's attack or develops a piece to defend.

Looking at the board, I think the best move is to develop the bishop to defend the king.

I will move the bishop from e7 to f8.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, I have a lot of options. White's queen is a threat, and I need to be careful.

*   **Developing the Bishop:** `f8e7` looks like a solid developing move, getting the bishop off the back rank and potentially eyeing the kingside.
*   **Pawn Moves:** Pushing pawns like `h7h6` or `g7g6` can help solidify the kingside, but might also weaken it in the long run.
*   **Knight Moves:** `f6e8` or `f6g8` don't seem particularly helpful right now.
*   **Queen Moves:** `d8e7` seems like a reasonable move to develop the queen and protect the king.

Considering the position, I think developing the bishop to e7 is a good, solid move. It develops a piece, doesn't weaken my position, and prepares for potential kingside defense.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, I've got a lot of options. Let's analyze them.

*   **Pawn moves:** `h7h6`, `g7g6`, `b7b6`, `h7h5`, `g7g5`, `b7b5` These are mostly defensive and don't immediately improve my position. Pushing the h-pawn might be useful later for a kingside defense.
*   **Knight moves:** `f6g8`, `f6e8`, `f6h5`, `f6g4`, `f6e4`, `c6b8`, `c6a7`, `c6a5`, `c6d4`, `c6b4` The knight on f6 is well-placed. `f6h5` looks interesting, attacking the white knight and potentially opening lines. `c6d4` could be a good developing move, challenging the center.
*   **Bishop moves:** `d8g8`, `d8f8`, `d8e8` These are passive moves, and I don't want to block my own pieces.
*   **Rook moves:** `a8b8`, `a8a7` These are passive moves, and I don't want to block my own pieces.
*   **Queen moves:** `e7f8`, `e7d6`, `e7c5`, `e7b4` These are passive moves, and I don't want to block my own pieces.
*   **Pawn moves:** `d5d4`, `e5e4` These are passive moves, and I don't want to block my own pieces.

Considering the position, I think the best move is to develop my knight to h5, attacking the white knight and potentially opening the h-file for a future attack.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, I've got a lot of options. White's queen and bishop are eyeing my king. I need to develop my pieces and try to create some counterplay.

*   **h7h6**: This seems like a reasonable move to protect the h-file and potentially develop the rook later.
*   **g7g6**: This supports the f5 advance and prepares to develop the bishop.
*   **f7f6**: This blocks the diagonal of the white bishop, which is currently attacking my king.
*   **d7d6**: This seems like a good move to support the e5 pawn and prepare to develop the bishop.
*   **e7f6**: This seems like a good move to block the diagonal of the white bishop, which is currently attacking my king.

Considering the threats and the need to develop, I think **f7f6** is the best move. It blocks the bishop's diagonal, and it prepares to develop the bishop.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, I have a few options. White's queen is a major threat. I need to address that. Moving the rook on h8 doesn't seem to help much. The bishop on e7 has some interesting diagonal options, but they don't immediately address the threat. The pawn moves are mostly defensive.

I see a few possibilities:

*   **...Bg8** This develops my bishop and potentially defends the h-file.
*   **...Qf8** This develops my queen and defends the king.
*   **...h7** This prevents a potential rook lift.

Given the immediate threat, I think developing the queen is the most prudent move.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, I have a good list of moves. Let's analyze a bit. The most pressing issue is the exposed king. I need to develop a piece to defend it and also consider counterplay.

*   **h8g8, h8h7, a8b8, a8a7:** These rook moves don't seem to immediately improve the position.
*   **f8g8, f8e8, f8d8, f8f7:** Bishop moves. Developing the bishop is good, but the squares don't seem ideal.
*   **e7d8, e7d6, e7c5, e7b4, e7a3:** Queen moves. The queen is currently defending the king. Moving it away is risky.
*   **d7e8, d7d8, d7e6, d7d6:** Pawn moves. These don't seem to help the immediate situation.
*   **c6d8, c6b8, c6a7, c6a5, c6d4, c6b4:** Knight moves. The knight on c6 is well-placed. Moving it could be useful. c6d4 looks interesting, attacking the pawn on e2.
*   **h5f4, h5g3:** Knight moves. These moves don't seem to help.
*   **c7b6:** Pawn move. Doesn't seem to help.
*   **g7g6, g7g5:** Pawn moves. These don't seem to help.
*   **f6f5:** Pawn move. Doesn't seem to help.
*   **e5e4:** Pawn move. Doesn't seem to help.
*   **d5d4:** Pawn move. Doesn't seem to help.

I think the best move is to develop the knight to d4, attacking the pawn on e2. This opens up lines for the queen and bishop to defend the king.

Okay, I have a lot of options. Let's analyze.

*   **Pawn moves:** `h8g8, h8h7, g7g6, c7b6, c7c6, f6f5, g7g5, c7c5, e5e4` - These are mostly defensive or aiming to control the center. `h7` looks passive. `g6` and `c6` are standard. `f5` could weaken my kingside. `g5` and `c5` are more aggressive. `e4` is interesting, but might open the position too much.
*   **Bishop moves:** `f8g8, f8e8, f8d8, f8f7` - These are mostly about developing the bishop. `f7` is a good developing move.
*   **Rook moves:** `a8b8, a8a7` - These are about developing the rook. `a7` is a good developing move.
*   **Queen moves:** `e7d8, e7d6, e7c5, e7b4, e7a3` - These are about developing the queen. `d6` looks like a good developing move.
*   **Pawn moves:** `d7e8, d7d8, d7e6, d7d6, d7c6` - These are about developing the pawn.
*   **Knight moves:** `h5f4, h5g3, d4e6, d4c6, d4f5, d4b5, d4f3, d4b3, d4e2, d4c2` - These are about developing the knight.

I think I want to develop my pieces and control the center. The move `e7d6` looks good to develop the queen.

*   **...h5f4, ...h5g3:** Moving the knight is interesting. ...h5f4 attacks a pawn and develops the knight.

Okay, I see the board. White has a strong attack developing, and my king is somewhat exposed. I need to be careful. Let's get a list of my legal moves to see what options I have.

h8g8,h8h7,f8g8,f8e8,f8d8,f8f7,f8e7,d7e8,d7d8,d7e7,d7e6,d7c6,d6e7,d6c5,d6b4,d6a3,d4e6,d4c6,d4f5,d4b5,d4f3,d4b3,d4e2,d4c2,c7b6,e5f4,g7g6,c7c6,h6h5,f6f5,e5e4,g7g5,c7c5

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, I've got a lot of options. Let's analyze them:

*   **King moves:** h8g8, h8h7 - Moving the king is usually a last resort, but in this case, it might be necessary to get him to safety. h8h7 looks slightly better as it keeps the king closer to the action.
*   **Queen moves:** f8g8, f8e8, f8d8, f8f7, f8e7 - The queen is a powerful piece, but moving it now might expose it.
*   **Pawn moves:** d7e8, d7d8, d7e7, d7e6, d7c6, d6e7, d6c5, d6b4, d6a3, d4e6, d4c6, d4f5, d4b5, d4f3, d4b3, d4e2, d4c2, c7b6, e5f4, g7g6, c7c6, h6h5, f6f5, e5e4, g7g5, c7c5 - Many pawn moves. Some of these are defensive, some are trying to open lines.
*   **Bishop moves:** None.
*   **Knight moves:** None.

Considering the position, I think the most important thing is to protect my king and develop a counterattack. The pawn on d6 is a bit of a liability. I think I will move my pawn on d6 to c5, challenging white's control of the center and opening a line for my queen and bishop.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Okay, I have a lot of options. Let's analyze them.

*   **h8g8, h8h7, f8g8, f8e8, f8d8:** These are moves with the rook and the bishop. They don't seem immediately impactful.
*   **f8f7, f8e7, f8d6:** Bishop moves. These could potentially develop the bishop and control some squares.
*   **d7e8, d7d8, d7e7, d7e6, d7d6, d7c6:** Queen moves. The queen is currently blocked.
*   **c5e7, c5d6, c5b6, c5b4, c5a3:** Bishop moves. These could develop the bishop and control some squares.
*   **d4e6, d4c6, d4f5, d4b5, d4f3, d4b3, d4e2, d4c2:** Knight moves. The knight is well-placed, but these moves don't seem to immediately improve the position.
*   **c7b6:** Pawn move. Doesn't seem to do much.
*   **e5f4, g7g6, c7c6, h6h5, f6f5, e5e4, g7g5:** Pawn moves. Pushing g7 or h6 could open lines for the rook.

I think developing the bishop on f8 is a good idea. Let's try **f8e7**. This develops the bishop to a more active square and controls some important diagonals.

*   **h8h7:** This is a standard rook move, but it doesn't seem to accomplish much immediately.
*   **e7e6:** This pawn move controls some central squares and opens a diagonal for the bishop. This looks like a solid developing move.
*   **d7d6:** Similar to e7e6, this pawn move also controls central squares.
*   **c7c6:** This pawn move supports the pawn on d7 and prepares to develop the bishop.
*   **g7g6:** This pawn move supports the pawn on f6.
*   **f6f5:** This pawn move attacks the pawn on g5.
*   **e5e4:** This pawn move attacks the pawn on f3.
*   **g7g5:** This pawn move attacks the pawn on h6.

I like the idea of developing my pawns in the center. I think I'll go with **e7e6**. It opens the diagonal for my bishop and helps control the center.

*   **...e6e7:** This move looks interesting, potentially opening the diagonal for the queen.
*   **...c7c6:** This move supports the pawn on d7.

Considering the position, I think **...h7h5** is the most active and promising move. It challenges white's control of the h-file and creates a potential threat.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, I've got a lot of options. Let's analyze them.

*   **h8...**: The rook on h8 has several moves, but none seem immediately impactful.
*   **d7...**: The king on d7 has a few options, but moving it seems premature.
*   **e6...**: The bishop on e6 has a wide range of moves.
*   **c5...**: The bishop on c5 has a wide range of moves.
*   **c7...**: The pawn on c7 can move one or two squares. c7c6 seems reasonable.
*   **f6f5**: The pawn on f6 can move one square.
*   **e5...**: The pawn on e5 can move one or two squares.
*   **g7...**: The pawn on g7 can move one or two squares. g7g6 seems reasonable.

The most interesting moves seem to be those involving the bishops. Let's look at the bishop on e6. e6f7 attacks the pawn on f6. e6d6 attacks the pawn on e5. e6c6 attacks the pawn on b6.

The bishop on c5 has a similar range of options. c5d6 attacks the pawn on e5. c5b6 attacks the pawn on b6.

I think the most active move is to attack the pawn on e5. I'll move the bishop on e6 to d6.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, I have the list of legal moves. Let's analyze them.

*   **h8g8, h8f8, h8e8, h8d8, h8h7, h8h6:** These are rook moves. The rook on h8 has a lot of potential movement.
*   **d7e8, d7d8, d7e7, d7e6, d7c6:** These are king moves. The king on d7 has limited options.
*   **d6f8, d6e7, d6e6, d6c6, d6b6:** These are bishop moves. The bishop on d6 has a good diagonal.
*   **c5b6, c5d4, c5b4, c5a3:** These are bishop moves. The bishop on c5 has a good diagonal.
*   **c7b6:** This is a pawn move.
*   **e5f4, e5d4:** These are pawn moves.
*   **g7g6, g7g5:** These are pawn moves.
*   **c7c6:** This is a pawn move.
*   **f6f5:** This is a pawn move.
*   **e5e4:** This is a pawn move.

The position is complex. White has a strong attack, and my king is somewhat exposed. I need to develop my pieces and try to create counterplay.

I think the best move here is to develop the bishop on c5 to a more active square. I'll move it to b4, attacking the white knight on b1.

Alright, I have a lot of options. White's queen and rook are eyeing my king, so I need to be careful.

*   **h8g8, h8f8, h8e8, h8d8:** Moving the rook doesn't seem to help much immediately.
*   **h8h7, h8h6:** These moves don't seem to improve my position and might even weaken it.
*   **d7e8, d7d8:** Moving the pawn to promote it is not possible.
*   **d7e7, d7e6, d7c6, d6f8, d6e7, d6e6, d6c6, d6b6, d6c5:** These pawn moves don't seem to help with the immediate threats.
*   **b4c5, b4a5, b4c3, b4a3, b4d2:** These bishop moves don't seem to address the immediate threats.
*   **c7b6:** This pawn move doesn't seem to help.
*   **e5f4, e5d4, e5e4:** These pawn moves don't seem to help.
*   **g7g6, g7g5:** These pawn moves don't seem to help.
*   **c7c6, c7c5:** These pawn moves don't seem to help.
*   **f6f5:** This pawn move doesn't seem to help.

After reviewing the moves, I think the best move is to develop my bishop and protect the king.

Alright, I've got the legal moves. Let's analyze them.

*   **Rook moves (h8):** h8g8, h8f8, h8e8, h8d8, h8h7, h8h6. These are all possible rook moves. Moving the rook to h7 or h6 doesn't seem to achieve much immediately. Moving it to other files might be useful later.
*   **Pawn moves (d7):** d7e8, d7d8, d7e7, d7e6, d7c6. Promoting the pawn is not possible. Moving to e7 or c6 doesn't seem to help. Moving to e6 seems to be a good option to control the center.
*   **Pawn moves (d6):** d6f8, d6e7, d6e6, d6c6, d6b6, d6c5, d6b4, d6a3. This pawn is pinned, so it can't move.
*   **Pawn moves (c7):** c7b6, c7c6, c7c5. Moving the pawn to c6 or c5 doesn't seem to be useful.
*   **Pawn moves (e5):** e5f4, e5d4, e5e4. Moving the pawn to e4 seems to be a good option to control the center.
*   **Pawn moves (g7):** g7g6, g7g5. Moving the pawn to g6 or g5 doesn't seem to be useful.
*   **Pawn moves (f6):** f6f5. Moving the pawn to f5 doesn't seem to be useful.

I think the best moves here are to challenge white's control of the center. I'll play **e5e4**.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*   **h8g8, h8f8, h8e8, h8d8:** Moving the rook doesn't seem to help much immediately.
*   **h8h7, h8h6:** Developing the rook is a possibility, but doesn't address the immediate threats.
*   **d7e8, d7d8:** Moving the pawn to promote is not possible.
*   **d7e7, d7e6, d7c6, d6f8, d6e7, d6e6, d6c6, d6b6, d6e5, d6c5, d6f4, d6b4:** These pawn moves are not good.
*   **c7b6:** This pawn move seems to be the best option.
*   **e4d3:** This pawn move is not possible.
*   **g7g6, c7c6, f6f5, g7g5, c7c5:** These pawn moves are not good.

The most promising move seems to be moving the pawn from c7 to c6. This blocks the white queen's attack on my king and opens a potential escape route for the king.

Therefore, I will make the move c7c6.

Alright, I've got the list of legal moves. Let's analyze them.

*   **h8g8, h8f8, h8e8, h8d8, h8h7, h8h6:** These are moves for the rook on h8. Moving the rook doesn't seem immediately impactful.
*   **d7e8, d7d8, d7e7, d7e6, d6f8, d6b8, d6e7, d6c7, d6e6, d6e5, d6c5, d6f4, d6b4:** These are moves for the queen on d6. The queen is a powerful piece, and I should consider how to best utilize it.
*   **h5g4:** This is a pawn move.
*   **e4d3:** This is a pawn move.
*   **g7g6, f6f5, c6c5, g7g5:** These are pawn moves.

The most interesting options seem to involve the queen. I see a few possibilities:

*   **Qd6e7:** This develops the queen and attacks the pawn on e5.
*   **Qd6e6:** This also develops the queen and attacks the pawn on e5.
*   **Qd6c7:** This develops the queen and prepares to attack the kingside.

I'll choose **Qd6e7** as it develops the queen to a more active square and immediately puts pressure on the e5 pawn.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, I've got the legal moves. The most pressing issue is the attack on the Black King. I need to find a move that addresses this.

Looking at the moves, `h8g8, h8f8, h8e8, h8d8, h8h7, h8h6` are all Rook moves. `c8d7, c8e6, c8f5, c8g4` are Bishop moves. `e7f8, e7e8, e7d8` are King moves. `e7f7, e7d7, e7e6` are King moves. `d6c5, d6b4` are pawn moves. `h5g4` is a pawn move. `e4d3` is a pawn move. `g7g6, f6f5, c6c5, g7g5` are pawn moves.

The Queen on d4 is a major threat. I need to find a way to either block the attack or move the King to safety. Moving the King seems like the most prudent option.

Let's look at the King moves. `e7f8` is a possibility, but it takes the King into the corner. `e7e8` is also a possibility, but it doesn't seem to improve the situation. `e7d8` looks like the best option, as it moves the King away from the immediate threat and opens up a potential escape route.

Therefore, I will move the King to d8.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, I have a few options. The most pressing issue is the threat to my King. White's Queen and Rook are lined up on the h-file. I need to address this. Moving the Bishop on h8 seems like a good start. I can move it to g8, f8, or e8. Moving it to h7 or h6 doesn't seem to help much.

Let's consider the options:

*   **h8g8:** This develops the Bishop and potentially eyes the long diagonal.
*   **h8f8:** This also develops the Bishop and could help defend the h-file.
*   **h8e8:** This doesn't seem to do much.
*   **h8h7/h8h6:** These don't help with the immediate threat and block the rook.

I think **h8g8** is the best move here. It develops the bishop to a good square and prepares for defense.

Alright, I've got the legal moves. White is clearly threatening checkmate. I need to find a way to defend.

*   **g8h8, g8f8, g8e8, d8e8, d8d7, d8e7, c8d7, c8e6, c8f5, c8g4, c8h3:** These moves involve the rook and the bishop. They don't seem to directly address the immediate threat.
*   **d6f8, d6b8, d6e7, d6d7, d6c7, d6e6, d6e5, d6c5, d6f4, d6b4:** These are pawn moves. Some of these could be useful for defense, but the pawn on d6 is pinned.
*   **e4d3:** This is a pawn move.
*   **g7g6, f6f5, c6c5, g7g5:** These are pawn moves.

The most pressing issue is the threat to the king. The queen on d4 is a major threat. I think I need to move the queen to defend. Moving the queen to e7 seems like the best option. It defends the king and potentially opens up lines for counterplay.

*   **g8h8, g8f8, g8e8, g8d8, g8c8, g8b8:** These are all queen moves. Moving the queen along the back rank doesn't seem to help much in the current situation.
*   **g8g7:** Moving the queen to g7 seems passive and doesn't address the immediate threats.
*   **e7f7:** This is a pawn move. It doesn't seem to improve the position.
*   **e7e6:** This pawn move blocks the diagonal of the white bishop on f1. This seems like a good defensive move.
*   **d7e8, d7c8:** These are bishop moves. Moving the bishop doesn't seem to help much in the current situation.
*   **d7e6, d7f5, d7g4, d7h3:** These are bishop moves. The bishop on d7 is currently blocked.
*   **d6c5, d6b4:** These are pawn moves. These moves don't seem to improve the position.
*   **e4d3:** This is a pawn move. This move doesn't seem to improve the position.
*   **g6g5:** This is a pawn move. This move doesn't seem to improve the position.
*   **f6f5:** This is a pawn move. This move doesn't seem to improve the position.
*   **c6c5:** This is a pawn move. This move doesn't seem to improve the position.

The most promising move seems to be **e7e6**. It blocks the diagonal of the white bishop and helps to consolidate my position.

*   **g8h8, g8f8, g8e8, g8d8:** These are queen moves, but none immediately address the threat.
*   **g8g7:** This is a queen move, but it doesn't help.
*   **e7f8, e7e8, e7d8:** These are pawn moves, but they don't help.
*   **e7h7, e7g7, e7f7, e7d6, e7c5, e7b4:** These are pawn moves, but they don't help.
*   **d7e8, d7c8:** These are pawn moves, but they don't help.
*   **e6f7, e6f5:** These are pawn moves, but they don't help.
*   **e4d3:** This is a pawn move, but it doesn't help.
*   **g6g5:** This pawn move doesn't help.
*   **f6f5:** This pawn move doesn't help.
*   **c6c5:** This pawn move doesn't help.

It appears I have no immediate way to directly block the queen's attack. I need to move my king to safety. The best move appears to be to move the king to e7.

You are a professional chess player and you play as black. Now is your turn to make a move. Before making a move you can pick one of the following actions:
- 'get_current_board' to get the schema and current status of the board
- 'get_legal_moves' to get a UCI formatted list of available moves
- 'make_move <UCI formatted move>' when you are ready to complete your turn (e.g., 'make_move e2e4')

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Okay, I've reviewed the legal moves. White's queen and rook on the h-file are a concern. I need to be careful.

*   **g8h8, g8f8, g8g7, g8g6:** These are moves with my rook. Moving the rook to g7 seems like a reasonable developing move, defending the g-file and potentially preparing for a counterattack.
*   **e8f8, e8d8, e8f7, e8e7, e8g6:** These are king moves. My king is a bit exposed, but moving it now doesn't seem to improve the situation significantly.
*   **d7c8:** This is a bishop move. Not particularly useful at the moment.
*   **e6f7, e6f5:** These are pawn moves. f5 looks interesting, challenging the center.
*   **e4d3:** This is a pawn move.
*   **c6c5:** This is a pawn move.

I think the best move here is to develop my rook and challenge the g-file.

Okay, I've got a good list of moves. Let's analyze them.

*   **e8h8, e8g8, e8f8, e8d8, e8f7, e8e7, e8g6:** These are all king moves. Moving the king around is not a priority right now.
*   **g7g8:** This is a pawn promotion. Not useful.
*   **g7h7, g7f7, g7e7, g7g6:** These are pawn moves. Not useful.
*   **d7c8:** This is a pawn move. Not useful.
*   **e6f7, e6f5:** These are pawn moves. Not useful.
*   **e4d3:** This is a pawn move. Not useful.
*   **c6c5:** This pawn move looks interesting. It challenges the center and opens the diagonal for my bishop.

I think **c6c5** is the best move here. It develops a pawn, controls a key square, and prepares for further development.

*   **King moves (e8h8, e8g8, e8f8, e8d8, e8f7, e8e7, e8g6):** Moving the king right now doesn't seem ideal. It's better to keep the king relatively safe for now.
*   **Pawn moves (g7g8, g7h7, g7f7, g7e7, g7g6):** Pushing the g-pawn is not a priority.
*   **Pawn moves (d7c8, d7c6, d7b5, d7a4):** The pawn on d7 is pinned by the white queen.
*   **Pawn moves (e6f7, e6d6, e6f5):** Pushing the pawn on e6 is not a priority.
*   **Pawn moves (c5d4, c5b4, c5c4):** Pushing the c-pawn to c4 looks like a good developing move, attacking the center and opening the c-file.
*   **Pawn moves (e4d3):** This pawn is pinned by the white bishop.

The move **c5c4** seems like the best move. It develops a pawn, attacks the center, and opens the c-file for my rook.

*   **e8f7, e8e7, e8g6:** Queen moves. Similar to above, these don't seem to address the immediate threats.
*   **g7g8:** Pawn promotion. This is interesting, but I don't want to promote to a queen just yet.
*   **g7h7, g7f7, g7e7, g7g6:** Pawn moves. These don't seem to help.
*   **d7c8, d7c6, d7b5, d7a4:** Bishop moves. The bishop is blocked.
*   **e6f7, e6f5:** Pawn moves. These don't seem to help.
*   **e4d3, c4d3, c4c3:** Pawn moves. These don't seem to help.

The most pressing issue is the potential threat to my king. I need to find a move that improves the king's safety. The move **e8e7** seems to be the best option here. It moves the queen to a safer square and opens up a potential escape route for the king.

Alright, I have a few options. The pawn on g7 can promote, but that doesn't seem immediately helpful. The pawn on d7 has some interesting possibilities. The pawn on e6 can move. The pawn on c4 can move.

Let's analyze a bit. White's queen is a threat. I think I need to try and develop a counterattack or at least consolidate my position. The pawn on d7 could be interesting, but I don't want to give up the pawn for nothing. The pawn on e6 looks like it could be useful.

I think I'll move the pawn on e6 to f5. This challenges the center and opens up a line for my bishop.

Promoting the g7 pawn to a queen (g7g8) seems tempting, but it might be too aggressive right now. I think I need to consolidate my position first. The pawn on d7 has a few options. I could move it to d6, but that doesn't seem to accomplish much. Moving it to d5 could be interesting, but it opens up the position too much.

Let's try moving the pawn on g7 to g6. This defends the h7 square and prepares to support a knight on f6.

Alright, I have a few options here. The pawn on g6 has a lot of potential moves, but I don't want to weaken my kingside too much. The pawn on f5 can move, but it doesn't seem to immediately improve my position. The pawn on d7 has a lot of options, but none of them seem particularly strong. The pawn on e4 can move, but it doesn't seem to do much. The pawn on c4 can move, but it doesn't seem to do much.

I think I'll develop my pawn on d7 to d6. This supports my pawn structure and potentially opens up a diagonal for my bishop.

*   **d7e8:** This moves the pawn to promote to a queen, but it doesn't immediately address the threat.
*   **d7c8:** This moves the pawn to promote to a queen, but it doesn't immediately address the threat.
*   **d7e6, d7c6, d7b5, d7a4:** These are pawn moves that don't help.

It seems there's no immediate way to save the game. I will promote the pawn to a queen.

Alright, I've got the legal moves. Let's analyze them.

*   **...Qf7:** This seems like a reasonable developing move, getting the queen off the back rank and potentially eyeing some squares.
*   **...Qd7:** This also develops the queen, but it might be a bit passive.
*   **...Qg6, ...Qc6, ...Qb5, ...Qa4:** These are all aggressive queen moves, but they could leave the queen exposed.
*   **...g8:** This is a pawn move, and it doesn't seem to help much.
*   **...g7, ...g6, ...g4, ...g3, ...g2, ...g1:** These are all pawn moves, and they don't seem to help much.
*   **...fxg6, ...fxe6, ...fxg4:** These are pawn moves, and they don't seem to help much.
*   **...dxc4:** This is a pawn move, and it doesn't seem to help much.

Considering the position, I think developing the queen to f7 is the most sensible move. It gets the queen active and out of the way of any potential attacks.

*   **f5g6:** This moves the pawn forward one square. It doesn't immediately address the threat from the queen, but it does open up a diagonal for the bishop on f8.

*   **f7e6:** This moves the pawn forward one square. It doesn't immediately address the threat from the queen, but it does open up a diagonal for the bishop on f8.

Both moves seem to have similar characteristics. Given the position, I think moving the pawn to f7e6 is slightly better as it provides a bit more protection to the king.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Okay, I have the legal moves. Let's analyze them.

*   **e6g8, e6c8, e6f7, e6d7:** These are all possible moves for the black bishop.
*   **g5g8, g5g7, g5g6, g5g4, g5g3, g5g2, g5g1:** These are all possible moves for the black pawn on g5.
*   **f5g6, f5g4:** These are possible moves for the black pawn on f5.
*   **d5c4:** This is a possible move for the black pawn on d5.

The most interesting moves seem to be the bishop moves and the pawn moves. Let's consider the pawn moves first. The pawn on g5 can advance, but it doesn't seem to immediately threaten anything. The pawn on f5 can also advance, but it doesn't seem to create any immediate threats either. The pawn on d5 could capture on c4, but it doesn't seem to be a good move.

Now, let's consider the bishop moves. The bishop on e6 can move to g8, c8, f7, or d7. Moving to g8 would be a very aggressive move, but it doesn't seem to be a good move. Moving to c8 would be a passive move. Moving to f7 would attack the white pawn on g5. Moving to d7 would be a passive move.

I think the best move is to move the bishop to f7, attacking the white pawn on g5. This forces white to respond and opens up the position.

Okay, I have the legal moves. Let's analyze them.

*   **f7g8, f7e8:** These promote the pawn to a Queen or Rook. Not immediately relevant.
*   **f7g6, f7e6:** These are pawn pushes.
*   **g5g8, g5g7, g5g6, g5g4, g5g3, g5g2, g5g1:** These are pawn moves.
*   **f5g6, f5e6, f5g4:** These are pawn moves.
*   **d5c4:** This is a pawn move.

The most pressing issue is the threat to my King. I need to consider how to develop and defend.

*   **...g6** seems like a reasonable developing move, preventing a potential white knight jump to f5.

Therefore, I'll play ...g6.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Okay, I've got a few options. Let's analyze them:

*   **f7g8=Q/R/B/N:** Promoting the pawn to a queen is tempting, but it might lead to a quick exchange. Rook or Bishop are not good. A knight could be interesting, but it doesn't immediately help.
*   **f7e8=Q/R/B/N:** Similar to the above, promoting to a queen is tempting, but it might lead to a quick exchange. Rook or Bishop are not good. A knight could be interesting, but it doesn't immediately help.
*   **f7e6:** This opens the diagonal for the bishop, but it doesn't address the immediate threats.
*   **g6g8=Q/R/B/N:** Promoting the pawn to a queen is tempting, but it might lead to a quick exchange. Rook or Bishop are not good. A knight could be interesting, but it doesn't immediately help.
*   **g6g7:** This doesn't seem to do much.
*   **g6h6:** This doesn't seem to do much.
*   **g6g5:** This doesn't seem to do much.
*   **g6g4:** This doesn't seem to do much.
*   **g6g3:** This doesn't seem to do much.
*   **g6g2:** This doesn't seem to do much.
*   **g6g1=Q/R/B/N:** Promoting the pawn to a queen is tempting, but it might lead to a quick exchange. Rook or Bishop are not good. A knight could be interesting, but it doesn't immediately help.
*   **f5e6:** This opens the diagonal for the bishop, but it doesn't address the immediate threats.
*   **f5g4:** This attacks the bishop and opens the diagonal for the queen.
*   **d5c4:** This attacks the bishop.

**Decision:**

I think the best move here is to attack the bishop with the pawn. This forces white to react and opens up the diagonal for my queen.

Okay, I have a few options. The pawn on f7 can promote to a queen, rook, bishop, or knight. The pawn on g6 can move one or two squares. The pawn on g4 can move one square. The pawn on f6 can move one square.

Promoting the f7 pawn to a queen seems like the most aggressive and potentially the best move. It immediately puts pressure on the white king and creates a powerful attacking piece.

Therefore, I will promote the f7 pawn to a queen.

*   **h7g8**: This promotes the pawn to a queen. However, it doesn't address the immediate threat from White's queen and could lead to a quick checkmate.
*   **g6g8**: This promotes the pawn to a queen. Similar to the above, it doesn't address the immediate threat.
*   **g6g7**: This moves the pawn forward, but doesn't really help.
*   **g6h6**: This moves the pawn forward, but doesn't really help.
*   **g6g5**: This moves the pawn forward, but doesn't really help.
*   **g4f5**: This attacks the pawn, but doesn't address the threat.
*   **g4h4**: This attacks the pawn, but doesn't address the threat.
*   **f6f5**: This attacks the pawn, but doesn't address the threat.

The best move here is to promote the pawn to a queen and hope to survive.

I think the best move here is to develop the rook.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Okay, I have the legal moves. The pawn on g5 is a bit of a target. I also need to consider the bishop on h8. Let's see...

*   **h7g6:** This seems like a reasonable developing move, bringing the pawn closer to the center.
*   **g5g6:** This defends the pawn on g5.
*   **f6f5:** This challenges white's control of the center and opens the diagonal for the bishop.

I think I like **f6f5**. It's active and forces White to react.

*   **h7g8:** This promotes the pawn to a queen. This seems like a strong move.
*   **h7g6:** This moves the pawn one square. This is a developing move.
*   **g4h4:** This moves the pawn one square. This is a developing move.
*   **f5f4:** This moves the pawn one square. This is a developing move.

I think promoting the pawn to a queen is the most aggressive and potentially winning move.

Okay, I have a few options.

*   **g8h7, g8f7, g8e6, g8d5, g8c4:** These are all moves for the bishop. Developing the bishop is a priority.
*   **g4h4:** This is a pawn move.
*   **f5f4:** This is a pawn move.

Developing the bishop seems like the most important thing to do right now. Let's consider the options for the bishop:

*   **g8h7:** This develops the bishop, but it doesn't immediately control any key squares.
*   **g8f7:** This develops the bishop, and it eyes the weak pawn on h2.
*   **g8e6:** This develops the bishop and controls the important d5 square, potentially putting pressure on the center.
*   **g8d5:** This develops the bishop, but it's blocked by the pawn on e5.
*   **g8c4:** This develops the bishop and attacks the knight on b1.

I like the look of **g8e6** the best. It develops the bishop to a strong square, controls the center, and prepares for further development.

You are a professional chess player and you play as black. Now is your turn to make a move. Before making a move you can pick one of the following actions:
- 'get_current_board' to get the schema and current status of the board
- 'get_legal_moves' to get a UCI formatted list of available moves
- 'make_move <UCI formatted move>' when you are ready to complete your turn (e.g., 'make_move e2e4')

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, I have a few options. The pawn on f6 has several moves. The bishop on e6 also has some possibilities. I also have a pawn on f4.

The pawn moves f6g7 and f6e7 are not good. f6g6 and f6f5 look more interesting. The bishop moves e6g8, e6c8, e6f7, e6d7, e6f5, e6d5, e6g4, e6c4, e6h3 are all worth considering. The pawn moves f4e3 and f4f3 are also possible.

Let's think about the strategic implications. White's king is somewhat exposed. I could try to put pressure on the kingside.

I think I'll try to develop my bishop and put some pressure on the kingside. I will move my bishop from e6 to g4.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Okay, I have a few options. The bishop on g4 has some interesting diagonals. Let's consider the pawn moves first.

*   **f6g7, f6e7, f6g6, f6e6, f6f5:** These pawn moves don't seem to improve my position significantly.
*   **g4c8, g4d7, g4e6, g4f5, g4h3, g4f3, g4e2:** The bishop moves are more interesting.
    *   **g4c8:** This is a capture, but it doesn't seem to gain much.
    *   **g4d7:** This develops the bishop and attacks the pawn on f5. This looks promising.
    *   **g4e6:** This is a strong move, attacking the pawn on f5 and potentially opening the diagonal for the bishop.
    *   **g4f5:** This is a capture, but it doesn't seem to gain much.
    *   **g4h3:** This doesn't seem to do much.
    *   **g4f3:** This is a capture, but it doesn't seem to gain much.
    *   **g4e2:** This doesn't seem to do much.
*   **f4e3, f4f3:** These pawn moves don't seem to improve my position significantly.

I think the best move is to develop the bishop to d7, attacking the pawn on f5 and controlling a key diagonal.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Okay, I have the legal moves. Let's analyze them.

*   **d7e8, d7c8, d7e6, d7c6, d7f5, d7b5, d7g4, d7a4, d7h3:** These are all pawn moves. The pawn on d7 has a lot of options, but none of them seem immediately advantageous.
*   **f6g7, f6e7, f6g6, f6e6, f6f5:** These are the king moves. The king is currently in a vulnerable position. Moving the king seems risky, but it might be necessary to escape the potential attack.
*   **e4e3:** This is a pawn move.

Considering the board state, I think the best move is to move the king to a safer square.

*   **e7f8, e7e8, e7d8:** These are pawn promotions. Promoting to a queen is usually best, but I need to consider the resulting position.
*   **e7f6, e7e6, e7d6:** These are pawn moves.
*   **d7e8, d7c8, d7e6, d7c6, d7f5, d7b5, d7g4, d7a4, d7h3:** These are bishop moves.
*   **e4e3:** This is a pawn move.

After careful consideration, I'll promote the pawn to a queen. This seems to be the most active move and puts immediate pressure on the white king.

Now, let's see what legal moves I have.

Okay, I see the legal moves for the black bishop are: g4c8, g4d7, g4e6, g4f5, g4h3, g4f3, g4e2, g4d1. The legal moves for the black king are: e8f8, e8d8, e8e7, e8d7.

The most pressing issue seems to be the white pawns on c5 and d5. I need to find a way to challenge them. The bishop on g5 is currently pinned by the white bishop on d7.

Let's consider the king moves. Moving the king doesn't seem to help the situation.

Let's look at the bishop moves. Moving the bishop to f3 seems interesting, as it attacks the white pawn on d5.

Therefore, I will move the bishop to f3.

You are a professional chess player and you play as black. Now is your turn to make a move. Before making a move you can pick one of the following actions:
- 'get_current_board' to get the schema and current status of the board
- 'get_legal_moves' to get a UCI formatted list of available moves
- 'make_move <UCI formatted move>' when you are ready to complete your turn (e.g., 'make_move e2e4')

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, I have a few options. Let's analyze them:

*   **e8f8, e8d8, e8e7, e8d7:** These moves involve the black king. The king is currently in a vulnerable position. Moving the king is generally not a good idea unless absolutely necessary.

*   **f3g4, f3g2, f3e2, f3h1, f3d1:** These moves involve the black bishop.

Considering the position, I think the best move is to develop the bishop to a more active square.

I will move the bishop to g4.

Okay, I have the legal moves. Let's analyze them. The king has several moves, but they don't seem to improve the position. The bishop on g4 has a lot of options, but none immediately threaten anything significant. The pawn on e4 can move to d3.

I think the best move here is to develop the bishop and put some pressure on the white position. I'll move the bishop to e6.

The most pressing issue seems to be the exposed king. Moving the king to e7 seems like a reasonable defensive move. It gets the king out of the direct line of fire and potentially opens up the diagonal for the bishop on f8. Let's try that.

Okay, I have the legal moves. The king is in a precarious position. I see several pawn moves that could help. Let's consider the pawn on d7. Moving the pawn to d7e6 seems like a reasonable defensive move, blocking the potential attack from the white bishop on b2.

Alright, I have my legal moves. The pawn on f6 has several options. The bishop on d5 has some interesting diagonals. The pawn on e4 also has a few options.

Let's analyze. Moving the pawn on f6 to f5 seems like a good developing move, challenging the center and potentially opening the f-file for an attack. The bishop on d5 could target the weak pawn on g2. However, the pawn on f5 seems more immediately impactful.

Therefore, I will move the pawn on f6 to f5.

Okay, I have a few options. The pawn on f5 has several moves. I could push it forward to challenge the center, or I could develop my bishop. Let's consider the pawn moves.

*   **f5f6:** This seems like a reasonable developing move, pushing the pawn forward.
*   **f5e6:** This opens the diagonal for my bishop, but it might weaken my pawn structure.
*   **f5f4:** This is a more aggressive move, but it might leave my king exposed.

I think f5f6 is the most solid move. It develops a pawn and challenges white's center.

The most pressing issue is the exposed king. I need to develop a piece to defend it. The bishop on d5 looks like the best option. Moving the bishop to c6 seems like a good developing move, attacking the white pawn on b7 and potentially opening lines for my queen.

Okay, I have the legal moves. Let's analyze them.

*   **f6g7, f6e7, f6g6, f6e6, f6f5:** These are pawn moves. f6f5 looks like a reasonable developing move, attacking the pawn on e4.
*   **c6e8, c6d7, c6d5, c6b5, c6a4:** These are bishop moves. The bishop on c6 is currently blocked. Moving it to e8 is not very active. d7 and d5 are also not very helpful. b5 and a4 look like they could potentially put pressure on the white pieces.
*   **e4f3, e4e3:** These are pawn moves. e4f3 and e4e3 are not legal moves.

Considering the position, I think **f6f5** is the best move. It challenges the center, develops a pawn, and opens the diagonal for my bishop.

You are a professional chess player and you play as black. Now is your turn to make a move. Before making a move you can pick one of the following actions:
- 'get_current_board' to get the schema and current status of the board
- 'get_legal_moves' to get a UCI formatted list of available moves
- 'make_move <UCI formatted move>' when you are ready to complete your turn (e.g., 'make_move e2e4')

Okay, I see the board. White has a strong pawn structure in the center, and their king is a bit exposed. Black's king is also somewhat vulnerable. I need to assess the immediate threats and develop my pieces. I'll get a list of legal moves to help me decide.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, I've got the legal moves. Let's analyze them.

*   **f6g7, f6e7, f6g6, f6e6, f6f5:** These are pawn moves. Pushing the f-pawn seems premature and doesn't immediately improve my position.
*   **d5g8, d5f7, d5e6, d5c6, d5c4:** These are moves with the bishop on d5. Capturing the knight on g8 with the bishop (d5g8) looks interesting, as it opens up the g-file and potentially weakens White's kingside. However, it also allows White to recapture with the pawn, and the resulting position needs careful evaluation. Other bishop moves don't seem to offer immediate advantages.
*   **e4f3, e4e3:** These are pawn moves. Pushing the e-pawn doesn't seem to help much.

Considering the position, I think the most promising move is to develop the bishop and open the g-file.

Okay, I see the board. Black's king is currently in a precarious position. White has a rook on e8 and a knight that could potentially attack the king. I need to find a move that addresses this threat. Let's get the legal moves.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Okay, I have the legal moves. Let's analyze them.

*   **g8h7, g8f7, g8e6, g8d5, g8c4:** These are all moves for the black bishop. Moving the bishop doesn't seem to directly address the immediate threat to the king.
*   **f6g7, f6e7, f6g6, f6e6, f6f5:** These are pawn moves. Moving the f-pawn doesn't seem to help.
*   **e4f3, e4e3:** These are pawn moves. Moving the e-pawn doesn't seem to help.

The most pressing issue is the potential attack on the king. I need to find a move that either blocks the attack or moves the king to safety. Looking at the board again, the knight on g8 is the only piece that can directly defend the king. Moving the bishop doesn't seem to help.

Let's try to move the pawn in front of the king.

I'll go with g8e6. It develops the bishop, attacks a pawn, and puts pressure on the white king.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Okay, I have a few options. The most pressing issue is the potential threat to my king. I see the rook on e8. I need to consider how to defend against it.

*   **g6h7, g6g7, g6f7, g6h6, g6f6, g6f5:** These are pawn moves. While developing pawns is good, none of these directly address the threat from the rook.
*   **e6g8, e6c8, e6f7, e6d7, e6f5, e6d5, e6g4, e6c4, e6h3, e6b3:** These are bishop moves. The bishop on e6 is currently blocking the king's escape route. Moving the bishop is a possibility.
*   **e4f3, e4e3:** These are pawn moves.

Considering the position, I think the best move is to move the bishop to a square where it can defend the king. I'll move the bishop to f7. This defends against the potential checkmate threat and also develops the bishop.

*   **f7e8**: This moves the bishop to e8, potentially attacking the rook.
*   **f7e6**: This moves the bishop to e6, controlling important squares.
*   **f7d5**: This moves the bishop to d5, attacking the knight on b5.
*   **f7c4**: This moves the bishop to c4, attacking the pawn on c4.
*   **f7b3**: This moves the bishop to b3, attacking the pawn on a4.
*   **g6h7**: This moves the knight to h7.
*   **g6g7**: This moves the knight to g7.
*   **g6h6**: This moves the knight to h6.
*   **g6f6**: This moves the knight to f6.

**My plan:** I want to develop my pieces and put pressure on white's king. I think the best move here is to develop the bishop to e6, controlling the important squares.

Okay, I see the board. White has a slight material advantage, but the position is still quite open. My king is a little exposed. Let's get the legal moves to see what options I have.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Okay, I have a few options. The pawn on g6 can move, the bishop on e6 has several diagonals to consider. Let's look a little closer.

*   **g6-h7, g6-g7, g6-f7, g6-h6, g6-f6:** These are all pawn moves. Pushing the g-pawn doesn't seem particularly useful right now.
*   **e6-g8, e6-c8, e6-f7, e6-d7, e6-f5, e6-d5, e6-g4, e6-c4, e6-h3, e6-b3, e6-a2:** These are bishop moves. The bishop on e6 is a key piece.

I think the best move here is to develop the bishop to a more active square. Moving the bishop to f7 seems like a good developing move, putting pressure on the white kingside.

You are a professional chess player and you play as black. Now is your turn to make a move. Before making a move you can pick one of the following actions:
- 'get_current_board' to get the schema and current status of the board
- 'get_legal_moves' to get a UCI formatted list of available moves
- 'make_move <UCI formatted move>' when you are ready to complete your turn (e.g., 'make_move e2e4')

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Okay, I have a few options. The pawn on f7 has a lot of potential moves. Let's consider them:

*   **f7g8=Q/R/B/N:** Promoting the pawn to a queen, rook, bishop, or knight. This is a powerful option, but it's not immediately clear which promotion is best.
*   **f7e8=Q/R/B/N:** Same as above, but promoting to a piece on e8.
*   **f7e6:** This opens the diagonal for the bishop on f8, but it might also weaken the pawn structure.
*   **f7d5:** This attacks the center, but it might also be a bit premature.
*   **f7c4:** This is too far advanced and doesn't seem to help.
*   **f7b3:** This is too far advanced and doesn't seem to help.
*   **f7a2:** This is too far advanced and doesn't seem to help.
*   **g6h7:** This is a pawn move, but it doesn't seem to accomplish much.
*   **g6g7:** This is a pawn move, but it doesn't seem to accomplish much.
*   **g6h6:** This is a pawn move, but it doesn't seem to accomplish much.
*   **g6f6:** This is a pawn move, but it doesn't seem to accomplish much.

I think the most promising move is to develop the bishop and open the diagonal.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Okay, I have a few options. The most pressing issue is the threat to my king. Let's analyze the moves.

*   **g6h7, g6g7, g6f7, g6h6, g6f6:** These are pawn moves. They don't directly address the immediate threat to my king.
*   **e6g8, e6c8, e6f7, e6d7, e6f5, e6d5, e6g4, e6c4, e6h3, e6b3, e6a2:** These are bishop moves.

The bishop on e6 is the key piece here. I need to move it to a square where it attacks the white king and/or defends against any immediate threats.

*   **e6g8:** This seems like a good move. It puts the bishop on a diagonal that attacks the white king and also opens up a potential attack.

I'll make that move.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Okay, I have a few options. The bishop on g8 has a lot of potential moves. I could develop it to h7, f7, e6, d5, c4, b3, or a2. The pawn on g6 can move to g7, h7, f7, h6, or f5.

Let's consider the options.

*   **g8h7:** Develops the bishop, but doesn't immediately impact the center.
*   **g8f7:** Develops the bishop, but blocks the pawn on g6.
*   **g8e6:** Develops the bishop to a more active square, potentially eyeing the white king.
*   **g8d5:** A more aggressive move, attacking the pawn on c4.
*   **g8c4:** Attacks the pawn on b3, but leaves the bishop somewhat exposed.
*   **g8b3:** A very aggressive move, attacking the pawn on a2.
*   **g8a2:** Doesn't seem to achieve much.
*   **g6h7:** Doesn't seem to achieve much.
*   **g6g7:** Doesn't seem to achieve much.
*   **g6f7:** Doesn't seem to achieve much.
*   **g6h6:** Doesn't seem to achieve much.
*   **g6f5:** Opens the diagonal for the bishop, and attacks the pawn on e4.

I think the best move is to develop the bishop and open the diagonal with the pawn. I'll play g6f5.

Let's analyze these moves:

*   **h7g8:** This promotes the pawn to a queen. This seems like a good move, as it immediately improves the material balance.
*   **h7g6:** This moves the pawn one square. This doesn't seem to achieve much.
*   **f5g6:** This captures a pawn with the pawn. This doesn't seem to achieve much.
*   **f5f4:** This moves the pawn one square. This doesn't seem to achieve much.

Promoting the pawn to a queen seems like the best option.

Okay, I have a few options. The bishop on g8 has a lot of potential moves, but I need to be careful about developing it too early. The pawn on f5 can advance, but that might weaken my kingside. The pawn on b7 can move to c6.

I think the best move here is to develop the bishop to f7. This gets the bishop off the back rank and potentially eyes the weak f2 square.

You are a professional chess player and you play as black. Now is your turn to make a move. Before making a move you can pick one of the following actions:
- 'get_current_board' to get the schema and current status of the board
- 'get_legal_moves' to get a UCI formatted list of available moves
- 'make_move <UCI formatted move>' when you are ready to complete your turn (e.g., 'make_move e2e4')

Okay, I'm ready to analyze the position and make a move. First, I need to see the current board.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Okay, I have a few options. The bishop on f7 has a lot of potential diagonals. Let's consider them:

*   **f7g6:** This attacks the knight, but it can move.
*   **f7e6:** This also attacks the knight and develops the bishop further.
*   **f7d5:** This attacks the pawn on e4 and opens up the diagonal for the bishop.
*   **f7c4:** This attacks the pawn on b2 and puts pressure on the kingside.
*   **f7b3:** This attacks the pawn on a2.
*   **f7a2:** This is a long-range attack, but doesn't seem immediately impactful.

The pawn moves are less interesting.

I think **f7e6** is the best move. It develops the bishop to a strong square, attacks the knight, and prepares for further attacks on the kingside.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Okay, I have the legal moves. Let's analyze them.

*   **e6g8, e6c8, e6f7, e6d7, e6d5, e6c4, e6b3, e6a2:** These are all moves of the bishop on e6. The bishop on e6 is currently attacking the white king. Moving the bishop away from the king would be a mistake.
*   **f5g6, f5g4:** These are pawn moves.
*   **b7c6:** This is a pawn move.

The most forcing move seems to be to continue the attack on the king. Moving the bishop on e6 to g8 would be a check.
