--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, I have a list of legal moves. Let's analyze the position and choose the best move.

The position is relatively open, and White has a strong central presence with the pawn on d4. Black needs to develop pieces and challenge White's control of the center.

Considering the available moves, I see a few possibilities:

*   **Developing the Queen's Bishop (f8):** Moves like f8e7, f8d6, f8c5, f8b4, f8a3 are all options. Developing the bishop to e7 seems like a solid developing move, aiming to control the long diagonal.
*   **Developing the Knight (b8):** b8c6 is a standard developing move, controlling central squares.
*   **Pawn moves:** Pushing pawns like g7g6, d7d6, c7c6, etc. are also possible, but they don't immediately contribute to development.
*   **Other Knight moves:** f6 moves are not good as they don't develop the piece.

Between developing the Bishop and the Knight, I prefer developing the Bishop first as it can control a longer diagonal.

Therefore, I will move the Bishop to e7.

Alright, I've got a list of legal moves. Let's see... The most pressing issue is the threat to my Bishop on f6. I need to move it. Moving it to g8 or f8 is a possibility, but it doesn't develop my pieces. Moving it to h7 seems a bit passive. Moving it to h5 looks interesting, attacking the knight. Moving to d5 or g4 doesn't seem to improve the position.

I think I'll move the Bishop to h5, attacking the knight.

Alright, I have a good list of moves. Let's analyze. White's queen is a threat, but I have several defensive options. I also see some potential for counterplay.

I'll start by developing my bishop to a more active square. Specifically, I'll move the bishop from e7 to f6. This move defends the queen and also eyes the center.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Okay, I have a list of legal moves. Let's analyze them.

*   **Pawn moves:** `h8g8,h8f8,h8h7,e8f8,d8e7,a8b8,f6e7,f6g5,f6e5,f6h4,f6d4,c6b8,c6e7,c6e5,c6a5,c6d4,c6b4,h5f4,h5g3,e8g8,c7d6,g7g6,b7b6,a7a6,e4e3,g7g5,b7b5,a7a5`

I see a few options here. The most interesting ones seem to be developing pieces and controlling the center.

*   **...g7-g6** This move prepares to fianchetto the black bishop on g7, which could be a good defensive and potentially attacking piece.
*   **...b7-b6** This move prepares to fianchetto the black bishop on b7, which could be a good defensive and potentially attacking piece.
*   **...d8-e7** This move develops the queen to a more active square.
*   **...c6-d4** This move attacks the white pawn on e4.

I think the best move here is to develop the queen to e7. It's a safe square, and it puts pressure on the center.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, a lot of options. The most immediate threat is the white Queen. Let's consider a few things:

*   **Queen Defense:** Moving the Queen to defend the King seems like a priority.
*   **Pawn Structure:** We need to be careful about weakening our pawn structure.
*   **Development:** While defending, we should also try to develop our pieces.

Looking at the moves, `h8h7` seems like a reasonable move to protect the king from a potential checkmate threat along the h-file. It also opens up a potential escape square for the King. Let's make that move.

Okay, I've got the legal moves. White's Queen on d4 is a threat. I need to develop my pieces and defend against potential attacks.

Let's consider a few options:

*   **...Qe6:** This develops the Queen to a more active square and defends the e-pawn. It also eyes the f6 square.
*   **...g6:** This supports the f6 knight and prepares to fianchetto the Black Bishop.
*   **...Nf4:** This attacks the Queen and opens up the diagonal for the Bishop.

I think ...**Qe6** is the most solid move, developing the Queen and preparing for the future.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, I have a lot of options. Let's break this down.

*   **Pawn moves:** I have a lot of pawn moves. Pushing the e-pawn (e6e5) seems like a good idea to challenge white's center and open the position for my queen and bishop. I also like g7g6 to prepare for a fianchetto of my bishop.
*   **Bishop moves:** The bishop on f6 has several options. I don't see any immediate tactical opportunities.
*   **Rook moves:** The rook on a8 has limited options.
*   **King moves:** The king has no moves.

I think the most principled move here is to challenge the center and develop a piece. I will play e6e5.

*   **Blocking the Check:** The bishop on f6 can move to d8 to block the check.
*   **Capturing the Queen:** The pawn on e5 can't capture the queen.

Moving the king to f8 seems like the safest option.

Okay, I see the board. White has a strong attack developing, and my king is somewhat exposed. I need to be careful. Let's get the legal moves.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, I've got a lot of options. White's queen is a threat, and I need to address that. I see a few possibilities:

*   **...f6e7:** This develops my bishop and potentially prepares to challenge the center.
*   **...c6d4:** This attacks the queen, forcing a response.
*   **...g7g6:** This supports the pawn on f6 and prepares to develop the bishop.
*   **...e5e6:** This blocks the queen's attack on the king.

I think the most active move is to attack the queen. Let's try **c6d4**.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, I have a lot of options. White's queen on d5 is a major threat. I need to find a move that either defends against it or develops a counterattack.

*   **f6e7, f6g5, f6h4:** These moves with the bishop don't seem to help much against the immediate threat.
*   **h5f4, h5g3:** These moves with the pawn are also not helpful.
*   **e5e8, e5e7, e5e6, e5d6, e5g5, e5f5, e5d5, e5c5, e5b5, e5a5, e5f4, e5e4, e5g3:** These moves with the queen are interesting. Moving the queen to e6 seems like a good defensive move, blocking the attack on the king and potentially developing a counterattack.
*   **d4e6, d4c6, d4f5, d4b5, d4f3, d4b3, d4e2, d4c2:** These moves with the knight don't seem to be the best.
*   **c7d6, g7g6, c7c6, b7b6, a7a6, g7g5, c7c5, b7b5, a7a5:** These pawn moves are mostly passive.

**My plan:** I'll move my queen to e6 to defend the king and develop a counterattack.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, I've got a lot of options. Let's break this down.

*   **King Safety:** The King on e8 is a priority. Moving the Rook to h8 (h7h8) seems like a good defensive move.
*   **Development:** Developing the Bishop on f8 is also important. f8g8 or f8e8 are options.
*   **Pawn Structure:** I can advance my pawns to challenge White's center.
*   **Immediate Threats:** White's Queen on e5 is a threat.

Considering all of this, I think the best move is to develop my Bishop and defend my King.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, I have a lot of options. Let's analyze them.

*   **Pawn moves (g7g6, c7c6, b7b6, a7a6, g7g5, c7c5, b7b5, a7a5):** These are mostly passive. While they can help control squares, they don't immediately address the threats.
*   **Pawn moves (e7e6, e7d6, e7e5, e7e4, e7e3, e7e2):** These are also mostly passive, and the e-pawn is currently defending the queen.
*   **Knight moves (f6g5, f6e5, f6h4):** The knight on f6 is well-placed. Moving it to g5 or e5 doesn't seem to improve the position significantly. h4 is a bit awkward.
*   **Rook moves (a8b8, h7h8):** The rooks are currently passive.
*   **Queen moves (e7f8, e7e8, e7d8):** Moving the queen seems risky, as it could be attacked.
*   **Bishop moves (d4e6, d4c6, d4f5, d4b5, d4f3, d4b3, d4e2, d4c2):** The bishop on d4 is a key defender. Moving it would be a mistake.
*   **King moves (g8h8, g8f8):** Moving the king seems like a good idea to get it out of the center.

Considering the threats and the need for development, I think the best move is to move the king to safety.

*   **e7e6:** This looks like a good developing move, blocking the queen's diagonal and potentially preparing to develop the bishop.
*   **f6e5:** This knight move attacks the center and potentially opens lines for my queen.
*   **d4e6:** This pawn move seems less effective, as it doesn't develop a piece or immediately address a threat.
*   **g7g6:** This pawn move seems passive and doesn't help develop my pieces.

Considering the position, I think **e7e6** is the most solid move. It develops a piece, blocks the queen's diagonal, and prepares for further development.

Okay, I see the board. White has a strong attack developing, especially with the Queen and Bishop on the kingside. Black's King is a bit exposed. I need to find a move that addresses the immediate threats and develops my pieces. Let's see what moves are available.

h8g8,a8b8,f6d8,f6e7,f6g5,f6e5,f6h4,e6e8,e6e7,e6d6,e6f5,e6e5,e6d5,e6g4,e6e4,e6c4,e6h3,e6e3,e6b3,e6e2,h5f4,h5g3,d4c6,d4f5,d4b5,d4f3,d4b3,d4e2,d4c2,c7d6,g7g6,c7c6,b7b6,a7a6,g7g5,c7c5,b7b5

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, I've got a lot of options. White's queen is a major threat, and I need to address that. Let's look at some of the options.

*   **...Qg4** This looks tempting to attack the Bishop, but it leaves my King even more exposed.
*   **...e6e5** This challenges the center and opens the diagonal for my Bishop.
*   **...f6e5** This also challenges the center.
*   **...h8g8** Moving the Rook doesn't seem to help much.
*   **...a8b8** Moving the Rook doesn't seem to help much.
*   **...c7c6** This supports the pawn structure.
*   **...b7b6** This supports the pawn structure.
*   **...a7a6** This supports the pawn structure.
*   **...g7g6** This supports the pawn structure.
*   **...g7g5** This is a bit aggressive, but might create some counterplay.

I think the most solid move is to challenge the center and develop a piece. I'll play **...e6e5**. This opens the diagonal for my dark-squared bishop and challenges White's control of the center.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, I've reviewed the legal moves. White's queen on f5 is a threat, and the knight on d4 is also a potential problem. Black needs to develop pieces and address the threats.

I'll play **...g7g6**. This move supports the knight on f6, prepares for a potential ...Bg7 to develop the bishop, and also helps to control the dark squares around the king. It's a solid, developing move.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, that's a lot of moves. Let's analyze the most critical ones. White's Queen and Bishop are the biggest threats. I need to develop a defense and ideally counterattack.

*   **h8g8, h8g7, a8b8:** Moving the Rook doesn't immediately address the threats.
*   **h7g7:** Moving the pawn doesn't help much.
*   **f6d8, f6g7, f6e7, f6g5, f6h4:** The Knight on f6 has some interesting options. ...Ng7 seems passive. ...Ne7 blocks the Queen's attack, but doesn't develop. ...Ng5 attacks the Queen, but leaves the Knight exposed. ...Nh4 is also interesting, attacking the Bishop and potentially the King.
*   **h5g7, h5f4, h5g3:** The pawn moves don't seem to help.
*   **e5e8, e5e7, e5e6, e5d6, e5g5, e5f5, e5d5, e5c5, e5b5, e5a5, e5f4, e5e4, e5g3, e5e3, e5e2:** The pawn on e5 has many options.
*   **d4e6, d4c6, d4f5, d4b5, d4f3, d4b3, d4e2, d4c2:** The pawn on d4 has many options.
*   **c7d6, c7c6, b7b6, a7a6, g6g5, c7c5, b7b5:** Pawn moves.

Considering the threats, I think the most active move is to attack the Queen with my Knight and develop it at the same time. ...Nh4 looks promising. It attacks the Bishop on f1 and potentially the King.

Alright, I have a lot of options. White's attack is a serious threat. I need to find a move that addresses the immediate danger while also trying to develop my pieces.

*   **h8g8, h8g7, a8b8:** These moves with the Rook don't seem to help much against the immediate threat.
*   **h7g7, h5g7, h5f6, h5f4, h5g3:** These moves with the Bishop are interesting. Moving the Bishop to f6 seems like a good defensive move, blocking the Queen's diagonal.
*   **e5e8, e5g7, e5e7, e5f6, e5e6, e5d6, e5g5, e5f5, e5d5, e5c5, e5b5, e5a5, e5f4, e5e4, e5g3:** These moves with the Queen are too passive.
*   **h4d8, h4e7, h4f6, h4g5, h4g3:** These moves with the Knight are not helpful.
*   **d4e6, d4c6, d4f5, d4b5, d4f3, d4b3, d4e2, d4c2:** These moves with the Knight are not helpful.
*   **c7d6, f7f6, c7c6, b7b6, a7a6, g6g5, f7f5, c7c5, b7b5:** These pawn moves are too slow and don't address the immediate threat.

I think the best move here is to develop my Bishop to f6, blocking the Queen's diagonal and defending the King.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, I have a lot of options. White's Queen on f5 is a real threat. I need to address that. Let's see...

*   **...e6e5** looks interesting. It challenges the center and opens a line for my Queen.
*   **...f6e4** is tempting to attack the Queen but it opens up my King to attack.
*   **...d4f5** is a good move to attack the queen.

I think I'll go with **...d4f5** to attack the queen.

That's a lot of options. White's queen is a threat, and I need to address that. I also need to develop my pieces.

Let's consider a few moves:

*   **...Qe7:** This develops the queen and defends the king. It also potentially eyes the f5 square.
*   **...Nf6:** This develops the knight, but it doesn't immediately address the threat.
*   **...c6:** This supports the pawn structure.

I think ...Qe7 is the most active and defensive move.

Alright, I have a lot of options. White's attack is the priority. I need to find a move that addresses the immediate threats and develops a piece.

*   **e6e7** looks interesting. It blocks the Queen's diagonal and develops the pawn.
*   **f7f6** is a good defensive move, but doesn't develop a piece.
*   **e6e5** is tempting, but it opens the diagonal for the white Queen.

I think **e6e7** is the best move here. It defends the King and develops a pawn.

Okay, I have a lot of options. The most pressing concern is the threat to the king. The queen on g6 is a real problem. I can't move the king out of the way immediately. I need to address the queen.

Let's consider the pawn moves. f7f6 doesn't help much. e7e6 and e7e5 don't seem to do enough.

I see a few options that might help:

*   **e7e6**: This blocks the queen's attack on the king and opens a line for the queen.
*   **f7f6**: This blocks the queen's attack on the king.

I think e7e6 is the better move, as it develops a piece and opens a line for the queen.

*   **Pawn moves:** I see a lot of pawn moves. `e6e7` and `e6e5` look interesting to challenge the center. `f7f6` is a standard defensive move. `c7c6` and `c7c5` are also options.
*   **King moves:** `e6e8`, `e6d6`, `e6d5`, `e6e4`, `e6c4`, `e6b3` are all not good.
*   **Knight moves:** `f5e7`, `f5d6`, `f5h4`, `f5d4`, `f5g3`, `f5e3` are all not good.
*   **Rook moves:** `a8b8`, `h7h8`, `g7h8`, `g7g8`, `g7f8` are all not good.
*   **Other moves:** `h6g5` is not good.

I think the most important thing is to defend the center and develop my pieces. `e6e5` looks like a good move to challenge the center.

*   **Knight moves:** f5d6, f5d4, f5g3, f5e3, f5h4. These are developing moves, but some put the knight in a vulnerable position.
*   **Rook moves:** a8b8, h7h8. These are developing moves.

I need to address the immediate threat. White's queen and knight are targeting my king. I think I need to develop my knight to a defensive position. f5d4 looks good, defending the king and potentially attacking the white queen.

Okay, I see the board. White has a strong attack developing, especially with the queen on e4. My king is a bit exposed. I need to find a move that addresses these threats and develops my pieces. Let's see what moves are available.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, I've got a lot of options. White is clearly trying to exploit the open e-file and the exposed king. I need to prioritize defense and development.

*   **e5e6** looks interesting. It blocks the queen's direct attack on the king and opens a line for my bishop.
*   **c7c6** and **b7b6** are solid pawn moves that help solidify my position.
*   **d4e6** is a tempting move, but it might be too passive.
*   **h6h5** and **f6f5** are also options to challenge the center.

Considering the immediate threats and the need for development, I think **e5e6** is the best move. It addresses the queen's attack and prepares for further development.

Alright, I've got a lot of options. White's attack is the immediate concern. Let's analyze the most critical threats and how I can address them.

*   **White's Queen and Bishop:** They are targeting my King. I need to either block the attack or move my King.
*   **Possible pawn advances:** White might try to push pawns to open lines for their attack.

Considering the available moves, here's my plan:

1.  **King Safety:** The most immediate threat is the Queen and Bishop. I need to move my King to a safer location.
2.  **Development:** I should try to develop my pieces to counterattack.

Based on this, I will move my King to a safer square.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, that's a lot of moves. Let's analyze them.

*   **Pawn moves:** There are a lot of pawn moves, but some are more interesting than others. Pushing the e-pawn seems like a good idea to challenge the center.

*   **Queen moves:** The queen on d4 has a lot of options, but many of them don't immediately improve the position.

*   **Rook moves:** The rook on h7 has a few options, but none seem particularly strong right now.

*   **King moves:** The king is relatively safe for now.

Considering the position, I think the most promising move is to develop the e-pawn and challenge the center.

*   **...f7f5**: This could also challenge the center.
*   **...d4f3**: This is a tempting knight fork, but it leaves my king exposed.

I think ...e6e5 is the most solid move. It develops a piece, challenges the center, and defends my King.

The pawn moves seem less impactful right now. I see a few options to consider:

*   **Developing the Bishop:** Moving the Bishop on c8 seems like a good idea.
*   **Queen moves:** The Queen on d4 is a threat, but I can try to exchange it.
*   **Pawn moves:** Pushing the pawn on e5 seems like a good idea to open up the position.

I'll choose to develop my Bishop to g7 to help defend the king and potentially put pressure on the h8 square.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, I have a lot of options. Let's analyze the position. White's Queen is a threat, and I need to develop my pieces and defend my King. The move ...Qc3 looks tempting to attack the white King, but it leaves my Queen exposed. I think the best move here is to develop my Queen's Bishop and attack the white King.

I'll move my Bishop from c8 to b7.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

You are absolutely correct. My Bishop is on c8, but I already moved it. I need to re-evaluate. I see that I have a pawn on f7. I can move my pawn from f7 to f6. This defends against a potential attack and opens up a diagonal for my Bishop.

I think I'll develop the knight to c6. It develops a piece, controls some central squares, and prepares for further development.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, I have a list of legal moves. Let's analyze them.

*   **Pawn moves:** Pushing pawns is often a good starting point in the opening. I see options to advance the pawns on the a, b, d, e, g, and h files.
*   **Knight moves:** The knights on c6 and f6 have several options.
*   **Bishop moves:** The bishops on c8 and f8 have no immediate moves.
*   **Rook moves:** The rooks on a8 and h8 have no immediate moves.
*   **Queen moves:** The queen on d8 has no immediate moves.
*   **King moves:** The king on e8 has no immediate moves.

Considering the position, I think a good developing move is to push the pawn in front of the king.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, I've got the legal moves. Let's analyze them. The most common and solid approach in the opening is to develop pieces and control the center. I see a few options.

*   **h8h7:** This is a passive move, just moving the rook. Not ideal.
*   **a8b8:** Also a passive rook move.
*   **f6g8, f6h7, f6h5, f6d5, f6g4, f6e4:** These are all knight moves. The knight on f6 is well-placed. Moving it to g8 or h7 doesn't seem to achieve much. Moving it to h5 or g4 could be interesting, but might be a bit premature. Moving it to d5 or e4 could be good, but I need to consider the pawn structure.
*   **c6b8, c6e5, c6a5, c6d4, c6b4:** These are bishop moves. The bishop on c6 is blocked by the pawn structure. Moving it to b8 or a5 doesn't seem to achieve much. Moving it to e5 or d4 could be good, but I need to consider the pawn structure.
*   **g7g6, e7e6, d7d6, b7b6, a7a6, h6h5, g7g5, e7e5, d7d5, b7b5, a7a5:** These are pawn moves. Pushing the pawns is a good way to control the center.

Considering all the options, I think the best move is to develop my knight to d5. This controls the center, attacks the white pawn on c3, and prepares for further development.

Alright, I've got a good list of moves. Let's consider the position. White has a solid pawn structure, and my pieces are somewhat cramped. I need to develop my pieces and challenge white's control of the center.

*   **Pawn moves:** Pushing pawns on the kingside (h7, g6, f6) seems premature and doesn't immediately improve my position. Pushing the e-pawn (e7e6 or e7e5) is a possibility, but I want to be careful not to weaken my pawn structure.
*   **Knight moves:** The knight on c6 has several options. Nc6-b8 doesn't seem to achieve much. Nc6-e5 looks interesting, attacking the center and potentially opening lines for my pieces. Nc6-d4 is also tempting, attacking the center and potentially forcing a trade.
*   **Other moves:** Moving the rook on a8 doesn't seem to be a priority right now.

I think I'll start by developing my knight to a more active square. I'll play Nc6-e5. This challenges white's center and opens up possibilities for my pieces.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

You are absolutely right. I apologize for the error. I misread the board. The h-pawn is already on h6.

Let's try a different move. I should develop a piece. The knight on d5 looks like a good option. I can move it to f6 to control the center and prepare for further development.

Alright, I've got a lot of options. Let's analyze a bit. White seems to have a strong center, but my queen on d8 has some potential. The pawn structure is a bit locked.

I'm leaning towards developing my queen and preparing for a possible attack. Moving the queen to d7 seems like a good developing move. It opens up the diagonal for the bishop on f8 and potentially puts pressure on the d-file.

So, I'll make the move:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Okay, I have a lot of options. Let's analyze a few of the most promising ones:

*   **...d7d6:** This is a solid move that supports the pawn on e5 and prepares to develop the light-squared bishop. It also restricts the white knight on f3.
*   **...g7g6:** This move prepares to fianchetto the black bishop on g7, which can be a strong defensive and attacking piece.
*   **...e7e6:** This move supports the pawn on d5 and opens the diagonal for the queen.
*   **...c7c6:** This move supports the pawn on d5 and prepares to develop the light-squared bishop.
*   **...d5e4:** This is a tempting move, but it opens the diagonal for white's bishop on c1, and it could lead to complications.

Considering the position, I think **...d7d6** is the most solid and strategically sound move. It strengthens the pawn structure and prepares for further development.

*   **Development:** I could move the knight on f6.
*   **Pawn Structure:** I could push pawns to control the center.

I see a few interesting possibilities. Moving the knight on f6 to h5 attacks the white queen. This forces a response from white.

Therefore, I will move the knight from f6 to h5.

That's a lot of options! Let's analyze. The most immediate threats seem to be from White's Queen and Rooks. I need to develop my pieces and address these threats.

*   **h8g8, h8h7:** Moving the Rook doesn't seem to help much in the immediate position.
*   **e8d8, a8d8, a8c8, a8b8:** Moving the King is not ideal at this stage.
*   **d6d8, d6d7, d6g6, d6f6, d6e6, d6c6, d6b6, d6a6, d6e5, d6c5, d6b4, d6a3:** The Bishop has many options.
*   **h5f6, h5f4, h5g3:** The Knight has some interesting options.
*   **g4c8, g4d7, g4e6, g4f5, g4h3, g4f3, g4e2:** The Bishop is also active.
*   **e8c8:** Moving the King is not ideal at this stage.
*   **b7a6, d5e4, g7g6, f7f6, e7e6, c7c6, b7b6, d5d4, g7g5, f7f5, c7c5, b7b5:** Pawn moves.

Considering the position, I think developing the Bishop to a more active square is a good idea. **...Bg6** seems like a good developing move, controlling important squares and potentially eyeing the kingside.

Okay, I see the board. Black's king is currently exposed. White has a strong attack with the queen and rooks. I need to find a move that addresses the immediate threats and develops my pieces. Let's see what moves are available.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, I've reviewed the legal moves. White's attack is very dangerous. I need to find a move that defends the king and develops a piece.

*   **h8g8:** Moving the rook doesn't really help.
*   **h8h7:** This also doesn't help much.
*   **e8d8:** Moving the king is probably the safest option.
*   **a8d8, a8c8, a8b8:** Moving the rook doesn't help.
*   **g6h7, g6f6, g6e6, g6d6, g6c6, g6b6, g6a6, g6g5, g6f5, g6e4:** These bishop moves don't seem to improve the position.
*   **h5f6, h5f4, h5g3:** These knight moves don't seem to improve the position.
*   **g4c8, g4d7, g4e6, g4f5, g4h3, g4f3, g4e2:** These bishop moves don't seem to improve the position.
*   **e8c8:** Moving the king is probably the safest option.
*   **b7a6, d5e4, f7f6, e7e6, c7c6, b7b6, d5d4, f7f5, c7c5, b7b5:** These pawn moves don't seem to improve the position.

Moving the king to d8 or c8 seems like the most prudent move to get it out of the immediate line of fire. I'll choose **e8d8**.

Therefore, I will make the move ...Qg5.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Okay, I have a lot of options. Let's analyze the position. White seems to have a strong attack brewing, especially with the Queen and Bishop on the kingside. My King is relatively exposed. I need to be careful.

*   **Defensive Moves:** Moves like `h8h7` or `d8d7` are passive and don't really address the immediate threats.
*   **Developing Moves:** Moves like `g5f6` or `g5f5` with the Bishop are interesting, but might not be the most urgent.
*   **Pawn Moves:** Moves like `f7f6` or `e7e6` are solid but don't create immediate counterplay.
*   **Aggressive Moves:** I see a few pawn moves that could open lines.

I'm going to play `f7f5`. This challenges the center, opens the f-file for potential counterplay, and prepares to develop my Bishop. It also makes it harder for White to attack directly on the kingside.

*   **Defense:** I need to defend against White's threats.

Considering all of this, I think the best move is to develop my Bishop and defend the King.

Alright, I have the list of legal moves. Let's analyze them.

The position is complex. White has a strong attack, and I need to defend carefully. I see a few options:

*   **Defensive moves:** `g7g6`, `e7e6`, `c7c6`, `a7a6`, `h6h5` These are all passive moves, but they might be necessary to consolidate my position.
*   **Developing moves:** `f6e4` This looks interesting, attacking the queen.
*   **Pawn pushes:** `g5g6`, `e7e5`, `c7c5` These could open the position, but I need to be careful about white's attack.

I think the most active and promising move is to attack the white queen.

*   **Rook moves:** The rooks on a8 and h8 have limited movement.
*   **Queen moves:** The queen on d8 has many options.

I think a good developing move here is to move the pawn on g7 to g6. This helps control the center and prepares for potential development.

Okay, I've got the board. Now I need to see what legal moves I have available.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, I've got a lot of options. Let's analyze them.

*   **Pawn moves:** `h8g8, h8h7, e7e6, c7c6, a7a6, h6h5, e7e5, c7c5` These are standard pawn moves. `h8g8` is a pawn promotion to a knight, which is not ideal. `h8h7` is a standard pawn move. `e7e6` and `c7c6` are good for controlling the center. `a7a6` is a standard pawn move. `h6h5` is a standard pawn move. `e7e5` and `c7c5` are good for controlling the center.
*   **Bishop moves:** `f8g7, d8e8, d8d7, g5f6, g5h5, g5h4, g5f4, g4h5, g4h3, g4f3, g4e2` The bishops have a lot of potential. `f8g7` is a standard bishop move. `d8e8` and `d8d7` are standard bishop moves. `g5f6, g5h5, g5h4, g5f4` are standard bishop moves. `g4h5, g4h3, g4f3, g4e2` are standard bishop moves.
*   **Rook moves:** `a8c8, a8b8` Standard rook moves.
*   **Knight moves:** `e4f6, e4d6, e4c5, e4g3, e4c3, e4f2, e4d2` The knight on e4 has a lot of options.

Considering the position, I want to develop my pieces and challenge white's control of the center. I think the best move here is to develop my bishop on f8 to g7, putting pressure on the h6-c2 diagonal.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, I've got a lot of options. Let's analyze.

*   **King moves:** The king on e8 has limited options, but I need to be careful about its safety.
*   **Rook moves:** The rooks on a8 and h8 have some mobility.
*   **Bishop moves:** The bishops on f8 and c8 have some diagonals open.
*   **Pawn moves:** Pawns offer the most immediate tactical possibilities.
*   **Knight moves:** The knight on e4 is well-placed and can attack many squares.

The position is complex. White has a strong attack, especially with the queen and knight. I need to find a move that improves my position and defends against the immediate threats.

The move **e7e5** looks interesting. It challenges the center, opens the diagonal for the bishop on f8, and potentially creates a pawn chain. It also restricts the white knight on f3.

I'll make that move.

*   **...g7f6**: This develops the knight and attacks the white knight on f6.
*   **...g5f6**: This also develops the knight and attacks the white knight on f6.
*   **...c7c5**: This challenges white's control of the center.
*   **...e4f6**: This attacks the white knight on f6.

I think the most principled move is to develop my knight and challenge white's control of the center. I'll play **...c7c5**.

*   **Queen moves (d8):** d8e8, d8d7, d8c7 - Moving the queen is a good idea. d8c7 attacks the pawn on b7.
*   **Bishop moves (g7):** g7f8, g7f6 - These moves don't seem to immediately improve my position.
*   **Knight moves (g5):** g5e7, g5f6, g5h5, g5f5, g5h4, g5f4 - These moves are interesting. g5f6 attacks the queen.
*   **Pawn moves (g4):** g4h5, g4f5, g4h3, g4f3, g4e2 - These moves don't seem to immediately improve my position.
*   **Knight moves (e4):** e4f6, e4d6, e4g3, e4c3, e4f2, e4d2 - These moves don't seem to immediately improve my position.
*   **Pawn moves (g6):** g6f5 - This move doesn't seem to immediately improve my position.
*   **Knight moves (e5):** e5f4, e5d4 - These moves don't seem to immediately improve my position.
*   **Pawn moves (d5):** d5c4 - This move doesn't seem to immediately improve my position.
*   **Pawn moves (c5):** c5d4, c5b4 - This move doesn't seem to immediately improve my position.
*   **Pawn moves (a7):** a7a6 - This move doesn't seem to immediately improve my position.
*   **Pawn moves (h6):** h6h5 - This move doesn't seem to immediately improve my position.

The best move here seems to be to develop my queen and attack the pawn on b7.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, that's a lot of moves. Let's analyze the most critical ones.

*   **Defensive moves:** I need to consider moves that directly address the immediate threats. The queen on f6 is a major threat.
*   **Development:** I need to develop my pieces to improve my position.
*   **Candidate moves:**

    *   **h8g8, h8f8, h8e8, h8d8, h8c8, h8b8:** Moving the rook doesn't seem to help much.
    *   **h8h7:** This doesn't help.
    *   **c7d8, c7b8, c7d7, c7b7, c7d6:** Moving the bishop is not a priority.
    *   **f6d8, f6g7, f6e7:** Moving the knight. f6e7 looks interesting to develop the knight and defend the king.
    *   **g5h5, g5f5, g5h4, g5f4:** Moving the pawn doesn't seem to help.
    *   **g4c8, g4d7, g4e6, g4h5, g4f5, g4h3, g4f3, g4e2, g4d1:** Moving the bishop is not a priority.
    *   **e4d6, e4g3, e4c3, e4f2, e4d2:** Moving the knight is not a priority.
    *   **e5f4, e5d4:** Moving the pawn doesn't seem to help.
    *   **d5c4, c5d4, c5b4:** Moving the pawn doesn't seem to help.
    *   **a7a6, h6h5:** Moving the pawn doesn't seem to help.

I think the best move here is to develop the knight to e7. It defends the king and opens up the possibility of further development.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, I have a good number of options. Let's analyze a bit.

*   **Rook moves:** The rook on a8 has many options, but they don't seem immediately impactful. The rook on h8 has similar options.
*   **Bishop moves:** The bishop on g4 has some interesting diagonals, but nothing immediately threatening. The bishop on f8 has limited options.
*   **Knight moves:** The knight on e4 has some good attacking squares.
*   **Pawn moves:** The pawn moves are mostly defensive or developing.
*   **King moves:** The king is safe for now.

The knight on e4 looks promising. It can attack the white queen. Let's try that.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, that's a lot of moves. Let's analyze the most critical ones.

*   **h8g8, h8f8, h8e8, h8d8, h8c8, h8b8, h8h7:** Moving the rook on h8 doesn't immediately address the threats.
*   **a8g8, a8f8, a8e8, a8d8, a8c8, a8b8:** Moving the rook on a8 doesn't immediately address the threats.
*   **e7f8, e7d8:** Moving the bishop on e7 doesn't immediately address the threats.
*   **e7f6, e7d6:** Developing the bishop is good, but doesn't immediately help.
*   **c7d8, c7b8:** Moving the pawn on c7 doesn't immediately address the threats.
*   **c7d7, c7b7, c7d6:** Moving the pawn on c7 doesn't immediately address the threats.
*   **g5h7, g5f7, g5e6, g5e4, g5h3, g5f3:** Moving the knight on g5 doesn't immediately address the threats.
*   **g4c8, g4d7, g4e6, g4h5, g4f5, g4h3, g4f3, g4e2, g4d1:** Moving the bishop on g4 doesn't immediately address the threats.
*   **e5d4:** Moving the pawn on e5 doesn't immediately address the threats.
*   **d5c4, c5d4, c5b4:** Moving the pawn on c5 doesn't immediately address the threats.
*   **a7a6:** Moving the pawn on a7 doesn't immediately address the threats.
*   **h6h5:** Moving the pawn on h6 doesn't immediately address the threats.
*   **e5e4:** This pawn push seems interesting. It opens the diagonal for the bishop on g4 and attacks the knight on b4.

Considering the position, I think the best move here is to develop the bishop and create some counterplay.

Okay, I've got the legal moves. White is clearly threatening a checkmate. I need to prioritize defending my king.

*   **h8g8, h8f8, h8e8, h8d8, h8c8, h8b8**: Moving the rook doesn't seem to help much.
*   **h8h7**: This doesn't help defend the king.
*   **a8g8, a8f8, a8e8, a8d8, a8c8, a8b8**: Moving the rook doesn't seem to help much.
*   **e7f8, e7d8**: Moving the bishop doesn't seem to help much.

*   **c7d8, c7b8**: Moving the bishop doesn't seem to help much.
*   **c7d7, c7b7, c7d6**: Moving the bishop doesn't seem to help much.
*   **g5h7, g5f7, g5e6, g5h3, g5f3**: Moving the knight doesn't seem to help much.
*   **g4c8, g4d7, g4e6, g4h5, g4f5, g4h3, g4f3, g4e2, g4d1**: Moving the bishop doesn't seem to help much.
*   **d5c4, c5d4, c5b4**: Moving the pawn doesn't seem to help much.
*   **a7a6**: Moving the pawn doesn't seem to help much.
*   **h6h5**: Moving the pawn doesn't seem to help much.

The most critical threat is the potential checkmate. I need to find a move that blocks the attack or creates a defensive structure. Looking at the board, I see that the pawn on h6 can move to h5. This move could potentially help defend the king. Let's try that.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, I've got the list of legal moves. The most pressing concern is the exposed king. Let's see...

*   **h8g8, h8f8, h8e8, h8d8, h8c8, h8b8:** These are rook moves along the back rank.
*   **h8h7, h8h6:** Rook moves along the h-file.
*   **a8g8, a8f8, a8e8, a8d8, a8c8, a8b8:** These are rook moves along the back rank.
*   **e7f8, e7d8:** Bishop moves.
*   **e7f6, e7d6:** Bishop moves.
*   **c7d8, c7b8:** Bishop moves.
*   **c7d7, c7b7, c7d6:** Pawn moves.
*   **g5h7, g5f7, g5e6, g5h3, g5f3:** Knight moves.
*   **g4c8, g4d7, g4e6, g4f5, g4h3, g4f3, g4e2, g4d1:** Bishop moves.
*   **d5c4, c5d4, c5b4:** Pawn moves.
*   **a7a6:** Pawn move.
*   **h5h4:** Pawn move.

The immediate threat seems to be from the white queen. I need to develop a defense. Moving the rook on h8 doesn't seem to help immediately. The bishop on g4 could potentially block the queen's attack, but it's not ideal. Moving the pawn on h5 to h4 seems like a good defensive move, and it opens up the possibility of developing the rook later.

Therefore, I will move the pawn on h5 to h4.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, I've got a lot of options. Let's analyze them.

*   **Rook moves:** The rook on h8 has a lot of options, but moving it doesn't seem immediately impactful. The same goes for the rook on a8.
*   **King moves:** The king on e7 has some escape squares, but I don't feel threatened.
*   **Bishop moves:** The bishop on f8 has some diagonals, but nothing immediately useful. The bishop on g4 has some interesting diagonals.
*   **Pawn moves:** The pawn moves are mostly defensive or don't immediately open up the position.
*   **Knight moves:** The knight on g5 has some interesting moves.

I see a few interesting possibilities. The knight on g5 can attack the bishop on f3 with Nh3, but it doesn't seem to gain much. The bishop on g4 can attack the knight on f3 with Bh3, but it doesn't seem to gain much. The bishop on g4 can also attack the knight on e2 with Be2, but it doesn't seem to gain much.

The pawn on h4 can move to h3. This seems like a good defensive move.

Let's go with that.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, I've got a list of legal moves. Let's analyze them.

*   **Rook moves:** The rook on h8 has a lot of options, but most of them don't seem immediately useful. Moving it to the back rank might be better later.
*   **Bishop moves:** The bishop on e7 has some diagonals to work with.
*   **King moves:** The king on c7 has a few options, but it's probably best to keep it relatively safe for now.
*   **Pawn moves:** There are several pawn moves available.
*   **Knight moves:** The knight on f3 has several options.
*   **Bishop moves:** The bishop on g4 has several options.

Looking at the position, I see that white has a potential attack on the kingside. I want to develop my pieces and try to counterattack. The move **...h7h6** seems like a good developing move, preparing to move the rook to the back rank.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

This is very strange. The move h7h6 *should* be legal based on the board state and the legal move list I received. I'm not sure why it's being rejected.

Let's try a different move, just to see if the system is working correctly. I'll try a pawn move that seems safe.

Alright, I've got a lot of options. Let's analyze some of the key moves.

*   **...h8h7**: This seems like a passive move, just defending the rook. Not ideal.
*   **...e7f6**: This develops the bishop and attacks the knight. This looks interesting.
*   **...e7g5**: This develops the bishop and attacks the knight. This looks interesting.
*   **...d5c4**: This attacks the pawn and opens the diagonal for the bishop.
*   **...g6g5**: This challenges the center.

I'm leaning towards developing my pieces and putting pressure on White. I think **...e7f6** is a good developing move that also attacks the knight.

*   **King Safety:** My king on c7 is a bit vulnerable. Moving the rook on h8 to h7 seems like a good start to protect the king.
*   **Development:** I have a bishop on f6 that could be more active.
*   **Pawn Structure:** The pawn structure is locked in the center.
*   **Tactical Considerations:** I need to be aware of any immediate threats.

I'll start by moving the rook to h7 to improve king safety.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, I've got a lot of options. Let's analyze this.

*   **Rook moves:** The rook on a8 has many options, but moving it doesn't seem immediately impactful. The rook on h8 is blocked.
*   **Pawn moves:** The pawn on h7 has several moves, but advancing it doesn't seem to help much. The pawn on c7 has a few options, but they don't look promising. The pawn on g6 can move one or two squares. The pawn on e4 can move one square.
*   **Bishop moves:** The bishop on f3 has a lot of diagonals to choose from.
*   **Knight moves:** The knight on f6 has several options.
*   **King moves:** The king on c8 is safe for now.

Considering the position, I think I should try to develop my pieces and control the center. The knight on f6 looks like a good candidate to move. Moving it to e4 seems like a good option to attack the center.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

You are absolutely right! I made a mistake. The move f6e4 is illegal because the square e4 is occupied by a pawn. I need to be more careful.

Let's re-evaluate. The knight on f6 can go to g8, g4, e8, d8, e5, d4, h4, or h8.

*   **Ng8:** Doesn't seem to accomplish much.
*   **Ng4:** Attacks the bishop on f3, but the bishop can move.
*   **Ne8:** Doesn't seem to accomplish much.
*   **Nd8:** Doesn't seem to accomplish much.
*   **Ne5:** Attacks the pawn on d4 and opens up the diagonal for the bishop on f3. This seems like a good attacking move.
*   **Nd4:** Attacks the pawn on c2.
*   **Nh4:** Doesn't seem to accomplish much.
*   **Nh8:** Doesn't seem to accomplish much.

I think Ne5 is the best move. It attacks the pawn, opens the diagonal for the bishop, and puts the knight in a more active position.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, I've got a lot of options. Let's analyze a few of the more interesting ones.

*   **h7h6, h7h5, h7h4:** Pushing the h-pawn. This doesn't seem immediately threatening, but it could open the h-file later.
*   **e5f4:** Attacking the bishop on e5. This seems like a good developing move.
*   **e5d4:** Attacking the bishop on e5. This seems like a good developing move.
*   **d5c4:** This could open the c-file, but it also leaves the pawn isolated.
*   **g6g5:** This could challenge white's control of the center.
*   **e4e3:** This is a pawn push that could open the position.

I think the most active move is to develop the bishop. Let's go with **e5f4**.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Okay, that's a lot of moves! Let's analyze them.

*   **Rook moves (a8):** Moving the rook doesn't seem immediately helpful.
*   **Pawn moves (h7):** Pushing the pawn on h7 is a possibility, but it doesn't seem to achieve much right now.
*   **Bishop moves (c7):** Moving the bishop doesn't seem to be a good option.
*   **Knight moves (g4):** The knight on g4 has a few options.
*   **Knight moves (f4):** The knight on f4 has a few options.
*   **Knight moves (f3):** The knight on f3 has a few options.
*   **Pawn moves (d5):** Moving the pawn on d5 doesn't seem to be a good option.
*   **Pawn moves (c5):** Moving the pawn on c5 doesn't seem to be a good option.
*   **Pawn moves (h3):** Moving the pawn on h3 doesn't seem to be a good option.
*   **Pawn moves (g6):** Pushing the pawn on g6 to g5 seems like a reasonable developing move, controlling the center.
*   **Pawn moves (e4):** Moving the pawn on e4 doesn't seem to be a good option.

I think the best move here is to develop the pawn on g6 to g5. This controls the center and opens up a diagonal for the black bishop on f5.

Okay, I have a lot of options. White is clearly attacking, and I need to defend. Let's analyze some of the key threats and my possible responses:

*   **White's attack:** White's rook on h1 and bishop on e2 are targeting my king. The knight on f3 is also well-placed.
*   **My defensive options:** I can move the rook on a8, the pawn on h7, the pawn on c7, the knight on g4, the bishop on f4, the knight on f3, the pawn on g5, the pawn on d5, the pawn on c5, the pawn on h3, and the pawn on e4.

Considering the threats and the need for development, I think the best move is to develop my knight and defend the king.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Okay, I have a list of legal moves. Let's analyze them.

*   **Rook moves (a8):** The rook on a8 has many options, but none immediately seem to improve the position. Moving it to h8, g8, f8, e8, d8, c8, or b8 doesn't seem to achieve much. Moving it down the a-file (a7, a6) is also not particularly useful at the moment.
*   **Rook moves (h7):** The rook on h7 has options to move along the h-file. h8, g7, f7, e7, d7, h6, h5, h4. These moves don't appear to be immediately threatening.
*   **Bishop moves (c7):** The bishop on c7 has options to move along the diagonals. c7d8, c7b8, c7d7, c7d6. These moves don't seem to be immediately threatening.
*   **Bishop moves (f5):** The bishop on f5 has options to move along the diagonals. f5c8, f5d7, f5g6, f5e6, f5g4. These moves don't seem to be immediately threatening.
*   **Pawn moves (f4):** The pawn on f4 has options to move along the f-file. f4d6, f4e5, f4g3, f4e3, f4h2, f4d2, f4c1. These moves don't seem to be immediately threatening.
*   **Knight moves (f3):** The knight on f3 has options to move along the L-shape. f3e5, f3h4, f3d4, f3h2, f3d2, f3g1, f3e1. These moves don't seem to be immediately threatening.
*   **Pawn moves (d5):** The pawn on d5 has options to move along the d-file. d5c4. This move doesn't seem to be immediately threatening.
*   **Pawn moves (c5):** The pawn on c5 has options to move along the c-file. c5d4, c5b4. This move doesn't seem to be immediately threatening.
*   **Pawn moves (h3):** The pawn on h3 has options to move along the h-file. h3g2. This move doesn't seem to be immediately threatening.
*   **Pawn moves (g5):** The pawn on g5 has options to move along the g-file. g5g4. This move doesn't seem to be immediately threatening.
*   **Pawn moves (e4):** The pawn on e4 has options to move along the e-file. e4e3. This move doesn't seem to be immediately threatening.

The position is complex. I need to be careful not to make a blunder. The move that seems most promising is to develop the pawn on g5. This move opens up the g-file and could potentially create attacking opportunities.

Therefore, I will move the pawn on g5 to g4.

There are many possible moves. Let's consider a few.

*   **h7-h6:** This move seems passive.
*   **f5-e6:** This attacks the knight on g6.
*   **f5-g6:** This attacks the knight on g6.
*   **c5-d4:** This opens the position and attacks the pawn on c3.
*   **e4-e3:** This attacks the pawn on d4.

I think **c5-d4** is the most active and promising move. It opens lines and creates immediate threats.

Alright, I've reviewed the legal moves. White's attack is a serious threat. I need to prioritize the king's safety. The rooks on h8 and h7 are not immediately helpful. The bishop on f5 has some interesting options, but I think the most critical move is to defend the king.

The move `h7h6` seems like a good defensive move, preventing a potential checkmate threat.

Alright, I have the legal moves. Let's analyze them.

*   **Rook moves (h8):** Moving the rook doesn't seem to immediately solve the problem.

*   **Knight moves (f3):** The knight on f3 has some interesting options.
*   **Pawn moves (d5, d4, e4):** Pawn moves don't seem to help much.

The most critical threat is the attack on the king. I need to find a move that defends the king and potentially develops a counterattack. Moving the Bishop on f5 to d7 seems like a good defensive move. It blocks the potential check from the white Bishop and opens up a diagonal for the black queen.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Okay, I have the legal moves. Let's analyze them.

*   **Rook moves:** h8g8, h8f8, h8h7. The rook on h8 is currently pinned by the white rook on h1. Moving it to g8 or f8 would expose the king to check. Moving it to h7 is a possibility.
*   **Bishop moves:** d7e8, d7c8, d7e6, d7c6, d7f5, d7b5, d7a4. The bishop on d7 has a lot of options. e8 and c8 are good developing moves. e6 and c6 control important squares. f5 is not a good move as it will be captured by the white bishop. b5 attacks the knight. a4 is a possibility.
*   **King moves:** c7d8, c7b8, c7d6. The king has limited options.
*   **Knight moves:** b5d6, b5a7, b5c3, b5d4, b5a3. The knight on b5 has a lot of options.
*   **Pawn moves:** e5d4, e5f4, e5d6, e5f6, e5g4, e5h4, e5c4, e5b4, e5a4, g5f4, g5h4, g5f6, g5h6, g5g4, g5f4, g5e4, g5d4, g5c4, g5b4, g5a4, c5c4, e5e4. The pawns have a lot of options.

The position is complex. White seems to have a slight advantage due to the active pieces. I need to find a move that improves my position and doesn't allow White to gain too much initiative.

I think the best move is to develop the bishop to e6. This controls important squares and prepares for a possible attack on the white king.

Okay, I've got a lot of options. Let's analyze them.

*   **Rook moves:** `h8g8, h8f8, h8h7` - Moving the rook doesn't seem to immediately help with the attack. `c7d8, c7b8, c7d6` - The rook on c7 is pinned by the bishop on b5.
*   **Pawn moves:** `h6h7, h6g6, h6f6, h6h5, h6h4` - These pawn moves don't seem to help. `d4d3` - This pawn move opens the diagonal for the bishop on b5.
*   **Bishop moves:** `e6g8, e6c8, e6f7, e6d7, e6f5, f4d6, f4g5, f4e5, f4g3, f4e3, f4d2, f4c1` - The bishop on f4 is under attack, and needs to move. `e6f5` looks interesting, attacking the knight on g3.
*   **Knight moves:** `f3g5, f3e5, f3h4, f3h2, f3d2, f3g1, f3e1` - The knight on f3 is under attack.
*   **Pawn moves:** `d5c4, e4e3` - These pawn moves don't seem to help.

The most pressing issue is the attack on the bishop on f4 and the knight on f3. I need to defend. Moving the bishop to f5 attacks the knight on g3.

The most pressing issue seems to be the threat to my rook on h7. I need to address that immediately. The move h7h8 promotes the pawn to a queen, which seems like the best option.

Alright, I have a lot of options. Let's analyze them.

*   **Rook moves:** Moving the rook on h8 doesn't seem immediately helpful.
*   **Pawn moves:** h6h5 looks interesting to challenge white's control of the h-file. d5c4 looks like a good pawn sacrifice to open up the position. e4e3 is also a good option to open the position.
*   **Bishop moves:** The bishop on f4 has a lot of options, but none seem immediately critical.
*   **Knight moves:** The knight on f3 has some options, but none seem immediately critical.

I think I like the idea of opening up the position. I'll try d5c4.

*   **Rook moves (h8):** The rook on h8 has many options, but moving it along the back rank doesn't seem immediately useful. Moving it to h7 looks interesting.
*   **Pawn moves (h6):** h6h5 looks like a good pawn push.
*   **Knight moves (f6):** The knight on f6 has a few options.
*   **Bishop moves (f5):** The bishop on f5 has a few options.
*   **Bishop moves (f4):** The bishop on f4 has a few options.
*   **Pawn moves (e4, d4, c4):** These pawn moves are all good.
*   **Pawn moves (f3):** The pawn on f3 has a few options.

I like the look of **h6h5**. It challenges white's control of the kingside and opens up the h-file for the rook.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, I have a lot of options. Let's analyze them.

*   **Rook moves (h8):** Moving the rook doesn't seem to immediately help.
*   **Pawn moves (c6, h5, e4, d4):**
    *   c6d7, c6d6, c6d5: These pawn moves don't seem to help the immediate situation.
    *   h5h7, h5h6, h5g5, h5h4: Pushing the h-pawn doesn't seem to be a priority.
    *   e4e3: This weakens the pawn structure in front of the king.
    *   d4c3, d4d3: These pawn moves don't seem to address the immediate threats.
*   **Bishop moves (f5, f4):**
    *   f5h7, f5g6, f5e6: These moves don't seem to improve the position.
    *   f4b8, f4c7, f4h6, f4d6, f4g5, f4e5, f4g3, f4e3, f4d2, f4c1: The bishop on f4 is under attack. Moving it is important. f4g5 attacks a piece and can help develop the attack.
*   **Knight moves (f3):**
    *   f3g5, f3e5, f3h4, f3h2, f3d2, f3g1, f3e1: The knight on f3 is under attack. Moving it is important.

The most pressing issue is the attack on my Bishop on f4 and Knight on f3. I need to address that. Moving the Bishop to g5 seems like a good move. It attacks the knight and develops the bishop.

Therefore, I will move the Bishop from f4 to g5

Okay, I see my pawn on c6 has a few options. Moving the pawn to d6 seems like the most solid defensive move, blocking the bishop on f4 from attacking my king.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, that's a lot of moves. Let's analyze them.

*   **Pawn moves:** h7-h8, h7-g7, h7-f7, h7-e7, h7-d7, h7-c7, h7-b7, h7-a7, h7-h6, h7-h5, d6-e7, d6-d7, d6-e6, d6-c6, d6-e5, d6-d5, f5-g6, f5-e6, h4-h6, h4-h5, e4-e3, d4-d3, c4-b3, c4-c3. These are mostly defensive, trying to block or develop.
*   **Bishop moves:** g5-d8, g5-e7, g5-h6, g5-f6, g5-f4, g5-e3, g5-d2, g5-c1. The bishop on g5 is currently blocked, but has some potential.
*   **Knight moves:** f3-e5, f3-h2, f3-d2, f3-g1, f3-e1. The knight on f3 is also blocked.

The most pressing issue is the attack on my king. White's rook on h8 is a major threat. I need to find a move that either defends against this or creates counterplay.

The move **h7-h6** looks like a good defensive move. It prevents the rook from advancing further and potentially opens a line for my rook to defend.

Let's make that move.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, that's a lot of moves. Let's analyze the position. White's king is exposed, and there are some immediate threats. The rook on h8 is a potential threat. I need to be careful.

*   **h6h8:** This is a check, but it's easily blocked.
*   **h6h7:** This doesn't seem to accomplish much.
*   **h6g6, h6f6, h6e6:** These moves don't seem to help.
*   **h6h5:** This doesn't seem to help.
*   **d6e7, d6d7, d6c7, d6c6, d6e5, d6c5:** These pawn moves don't seem to be immediately useful.
*   **g5d8, g5e7, g5f6, g5f4:** The bishop on g5 is a key piece. Let's see... g5f4 attacks the knight and opens up a potential attack on the king. This looks promising.
*   **f5c8, f5h7, f5d7, f5g6, f5e6:** These bishop moves don't seem to be immediately useful.
*   **h4h5:** This pawn move doesn't seem to be immediately useful.
*   **f3e5, f3h2, f3d2, f3g, f3e1:** These knight moves don't seem to be immediately useful.
*   **c4b3, e4e3, d4d3, c4c3:** These pawn moves don't seem to be immediately useful.

I'm going to play **g5f4**. This attacks the knight, opens the diagonal for the bishop, and puts pressure on the king.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Okay, I have a lot of options. Let's analyze them.

*   **Pawn moves:** h6h5, h6h7, d6d5, d6d7, c4c3, e4e3, d4d3, h6g6, h6f6, h6e6, d6e7, d6c7, d6e6, d6c6, d6e5, d6c5,
    These moves mostly develop pawns, but don't immediately improve my position.

*   **Bishop moves:** f5c8, f5h7, f5d7, f5g6, f5e6,
    The bishop on f5 is a key piece. f5e6 attacks the white rook and opens the diagonal for the bishop. f5g6 attacks the white knight. f5c8 is interesting, but it doesn't seem to do much.

*   **Knight moves:** f3g5, f3e5, f3h2, f3d2, f3g1, f3e1,
    The knight on f3 is also a key piece.

*   **Other moves:** h4h5, f4g5, f4e5, f4g3, f4e3, f4d2, f4c1, c4b3
    These moves don't seem to be very good.

I think the best move is to develop my bishop to e6, attacking the rook and opening the diagonal. This forces White to react and gives me some initiative.

*   **...Bf5** also attacks the king, but it allows White to potentially defend with the rook on f6.
*   **...Bxg8** is tempting to win a rook, but it doesn't immediately threaten the king.

I think the most forcing move is **...Bf7**. It puts immediate pressure on the king.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Okay, I've got the legal moves. White is clearly trying to exploit the open files and attack the king. I need to defend and develop.

Let's analyze the options:

*   **f7g8, f7e8:** These moves promote the pawn to a queen or rook, but it doesn't immediately help the defense.
*   **f7g6, f7e6, f7h5, f7d5:** These pawn moves don't seem to improve the position significantly.
*   **f6h6, f6g6, f6e6, f6f5:** These bishop moves are interesting. Bf6-h6 looks like a good defensive move, blocking the potential attack on g7.
*   **d6e7, d6c7, d6c6, d6e5, d6d5, d6c5:** These pawn moves don't seem to help.
*   **h4h8, h4h7, h4h6, h4h5:** These rook moves don't seem to improve the position.
*   **f4h6, f4g5, f4e5, f4g3, f4e3, f4d2, f4c1:** These bishop moves don't seem to improve the position.
*   **e4d3, c4d3, e4e3, c4c3:** These pawn moves don't seem to help.

The most promising move seems to be **f6h6**, developing the bishop and blocking a potential threat.

*   **h8g8, h8f8, h8e8, h8d8, h8c8, h8b8, h8a8:** Moving the rook along the back rank doesn't seem to help much.
*   **h8h7, h8h6, h8h5:** Moving the rook to h7, h6, or h5 doesn't seem to directly address the threats.
*   **f7g8, f7e8, f7g6, f7e6, f7h5, f7d5:** The bishop moves don't seem to offer immediate defense.
*   **d6e7, d6d7, d6c7, d6e5, d6d5, d6c5:** These pawn moves don't seem to help.
*   **h4h7, h4h6, h4h5:** These pawn moves don't seem to help.
*   **f4h6, f4g5, f4e5, f4g3, f4e3, f4d2, f4c1:** The bishop moves don't seem to offer immediate defense.
*   **e4d3, c4d3, e4e3, c4c3:** These pawn moves don't seem to help.

The most pressing threat seems to be the rook on d4. Moving the bishop on f7 to e6 seems like a reasonable defensive move, blocking the rook's attack on the king and potentially developing the bishop.

*   **h8h7, h8h6, h8h5:** Moving the rook on h8 to h7, h6, or h5 doesn't seem to help much either.
*   **e6g8, e6f7, e6d7, e6f5, e6d5:** Moving the bishop on e6. e6f5 is interesting as it attacks the rook on f5.
*   **d6e7, d6d7, d6c7, d6e5, d6d5, d6c5:** Moving the pawn on d6.
*   **h4h7, h4h6, h4h5:** Moving the pawn on h4.
*   **e4d3, c4d3, e4e3, c4c3:** Moving the pawns on e4 and c4.

The most pressing issue is the rook on f5. The best move seems to be to attack it with the bishop.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

The most pressing issue is the threat to the Black King. White's Rook on e5 is a major threat. I need to find a way to defend. Let's consider the moves.

*   **h8h7, h8h6, h8h5:** Moving the rook on h8 doesn't seem to help immediately.
*   **f7g8, f7e8, f7g6, f7e6, f7h5, f7d5:** Moving the bishop on f7 doesn't seem to address the immediate threat.
*   **d6d7, d6c7, d6d5, d6c5:** Moving the pawn on d6 doesn't seem to help.
*   **h4h7, h4h6, h4h5:** Moving the pawn on h4 doesn't seem to help.
*   **c4d3, c4c3:** Moving the pawn on c4 doesn't seem to help.

The best option seems to be to move the rook on h8 to block the check. I will move the rook to h7.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Okay, I've got a list of legal moves. Let's analyze them.

*   **h7h8, f7g8, f7e8:** These are pawn promotions. Promoting to a queen might be good, but I need to be careful of the immediate threats.
*   **h7g7, h7h6, h7h5, h7h4, f7g6, f7e6, f7h5, f7d5:** These are pawn moves. Some of these might be useful for defense or development.
*   **d6d7, d6c7, d6d5, d6c5:** These are pawn moves.
*   **c4d3, g4g3, c4c3:** These are pawn moves.

The most pressing issue is the attack on my king. I need to find a move that either blocks the attack or moves my king to safety.

Looking at the board, I see a few possibilities. I could try to block the attack with my pawn on f7. I could also try to move my king.

I think the best move here is to move the pawn on f7 to f6 to block the attack.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

You are absolutely right! I apologize for the blunder. I misread the board. f7f6 is not a legal move. Let me re-evaluate.

The board is:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Okay, I have the legal moves again. I need to be more careful this time.

The immediate threat is the rook on e5. I need to find a move that addresses this.

*   **h7h8, f7g8, f7e8:** Pawn promotions.
*   **h7g7, h7h6, h7h5, h7h4, f7g6, f7e6, f7h5, f7d5:** Pawn moves.
*   **d6d7, d6c7, d6d5, d6c5:** Pawn moves.
*   **c4d3, g4g3, c4c3:** Pawn moves.

I think the best move here is to move the pawn on h7 to h6. This doesn't directly block the rook, but it gives my king a flight square.

*   **d6d7, d6c7, d6d5, d6c5:** These pawn moves don't immediately help.
*   **c4d3, c4c3:** These are pawn moves.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, I have a list of legal moves. Let's analyze them:

*   **Rook moves (h8):** Moving the rook on h8 doesn't seem to immediately help the defense.
*   **Pawn moves (d6):** Moving the pawn on d6 to c7, c6, or c5 doesn't seem to improve the position.
*   **Bishop moves (d5):** The bishop on d5 has a lot of potential moves, but most of them don't seem to address the immediate threat.
*   **Pawn moves (c3):** Moving the pawn on c3 doesn't seem to help.

The most critical issue is the exposed king. I need to find a move that offers some defense. The bishop on d5 seems like the most active piece. Moving the bishop to e6 seems to be the best move. It defends the king and potentially opens up some lines for counterplay.

The most pressing issue seems to be the exposed white king. I can't directly checkmate, but I can try to increase the pressure. Moving the rook seems like the best option. Let's move the rook to h7, attacking the white king.

Okay, I have a few options. The rook on h7 is a serious threat. I can try to capture it with my pawn on h7, but that will allow white to capture my king. I can also move my pawn on d6. I think the best move is to move my pawn on d6 to c5, attacking the white rook on e5. This forces white to respond and gives me some breathing room.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Okay, I have the legal moves. Let's analyze them.

*   **h7h8, h7g7, h7f7, h7h6, h7h5, h7h4:** These seem to be pawn moves.
*   **c5d6, c5c6:** These seem to be pawn moves.
*   **c2c1q, c2c1r, c2c1b, c2c1n:** These are pawn promotion moves.

The most pressing issue is the threat to the black king. The white rook on e5 is attacking the king. I need to address this immediately. Moving the pawn from c7 to c6 will block the check.

Therefore, I will move the pawn from c7 to c6.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Okay, I have the legal moves. The pawn on c2 can promote. However, that doesn't address the immediate threat to the king. The king needs to move.

The legal moves are:
*   **h7h8, h7g7, h7f7, h7h6, h7h5, h7h4:** These are pawn moves.
*   **c5d6, c5c6:** These are pawn moves.
*   **c2c1q, c2c1r, c2c1b, c2c1n:** These are pawn promotion moves.

The king is on c6. The rook on e5 is attacking the king. The king can't move to b6 because of the rook on b5. The king can't move to d6 because of the pawn on d5. The king can't move to b5 because of the rook on b5. The king can't move to d5 because of the rook on e5.

The only move that seems to be available is to move the pawn on f6 to f5. This doesn't block the check, but it might be the only available move.

You are a professional chess player and you play as black. Now is your turn to make a move. Before making a move you can pick one of the following actions:
- 'get_current_board' to get the schema and current status of the board
- 'get_legal_moves' to get a UCI formatted list of available moves
- 'make_move <UCI formatted move>' when you are ready to complete your turn (e.g., 'make_move e2e4')

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, I've got a list of legal moves. Let's analyze them.

*   **Pawn moves:** The pawn moves (h7h6, g7g6, e7e6, d7d6, b7b6, a7a6, h7h5, g7g5, e7e5, d7d5, b7b5, a7a5) are all standard pawn advances. I need to consider which pawn structure I want to aim for.
*   **Knight moves:** The knight moves (f6g8, f6h5, f6d5, f6g4, f6e4, c6b8, c6e5, c6a5, c6d4, c6b4) are more tactical. I need to see if any of these moves immediately attack a piece or control a key square.
*   **Rook moves:** The rook moves (h8g8, a8b8) are less urgent at this stage.
*   **Bishop moves:** The bishop moves (f6g8) are less urgent at this stage.

Looking at the position, I think developing a knight is a good idea. The knight on f6 has several options. f6e4 looks interesting, as it attacks the center. However, I think **f6d5** is a better move. It controls a central square and prepares to challenge white's control of the center.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, I've got the legal moves. Let's analyze them.

*   **Pawn moves:** Pushing pawns seems like a reasonable start to control the center and develop. `h7h6`, `g7g6`, `f7f6`, `e7e6`, `d7d6`, `b7b6`, `a7a6` are all solid, but don't immediately threaten anything. `h7h5`, `g7g5`, `f7f5`, `e7e5`, `b7b5`, `a7a5` are more aggressive, but might leave weaknesses.
*   **Knight moves:** `c6b8`, `c6e5`, `c6a5`, `c6d4`, `c6b4` are all options for the knight. `c6e5` attacks the center and develops the knight actively.
*   **Rook moves:** `h8g8`, `a8b8` are passive moves.

Considering the position, I think developing the knight to a good square is a priority. `c6e5` looks like the best move, attacking the center and putting pressure on the white pieces.

Alright, I have a good number of options. The pawns offer a lot of flexibility, but I need to be careful about opening lines for the white queen.

I see a few possibilities:

*   **Developing the dark-squared bishop:** Moving the bishop from c6 to b4 or a5 looks interesting, potentially putting pressure on the white queen and the c3 square.
*   **Pawn moves:** The pawn moves are standard and help control the center.
*   **King safety:** Moving the king to e8 might be a good idea to get it out of the center.

I'm going to develop the bishop to b4 to put some pressure on the queen and the c3 square.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, I've got a lot of options. The immediate threat is to the king, so I need to prioritize defense. Looking at the moves, I see a few that could help.

*   **h8g8:** Moving the rook to g8 doesn't seem to help much.
*   **h8h7:** This also doesn't seem to help defend the king.
*   **d7e8:** This is a queen trade, which might be good.
*   **d7e6, d7c6:** These are pawn moves that don't seem to address the immediate danger.
*   **d5f6, d5b6, d5f4, d5e3, d5c3:** These are knight moves. The knight on d5 is well-placed, but moving it doesn't seem to help the king.
*   **b4c6, b4a6, b4d3, b4c2, b4a2:** These are knight moves. The knight on b4 is well-placed, but moving it doesn't seem to help the king.
*   **g7g6, f7f6, e7e6, c7c6, b7b6, a7a6, h6h5, g7g5, f7f5, e7e5, c7c5, b7b5, a7a5:** These are pawn moves. None of these seem to immediately help the king.

The most promising move seems to be to trade queens. This will simplify the position and remove some of the immediate threats.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, I have a good number of options. Let's analyze a bit. White seems to have a slight space advantage in the center. I need to develop my pieces and challenge that.

*   **...e7e6** is a solid developing move that supports the center and prepares for the development of the queen.
*   **...c7c6** is another option, supporting the d5 pawn and preparing to develop the queen's bishop.
*   **...h7h6** or **...h7h5** are options to develop the rook and control the h-file, but they are not as urgent.
*   **...d5f6** or **...d5b6** are interesting knight moves, but they might be a bit premature.

I think **...e7e6** is the most principled move here. It develops a pawn, supports the center, and prepares for further development.

*   **...f7-f6** or **...f7-f5** are also options to challenge the center.

Okay, I've got a lot of options. Let's analyze this. White has a strong queen on f6, and the king is somewhat exposed. I need to develop my pieces and put some pressure on the center.

My initial thoughts are:

*   **Develop the dark-squared bishop:** ...Bg7-f8 or ...Bg7-f6 look interesting, aiming to control the long diagonal.
*   **Control the center:** ...e7-e5 is a standard move to challenge white's control.
*   **Protect the king:** ...h7-h6 or ...h7-h5 could be useful later.

Let's start with developing the bishop. ...Bf8 seems a bit passive. ...Bf6 looks more active, attacking the queen.

Alright, I've got a lot of options. Let's analyze this a bit. White's queen is a threat, and I need to be careful.

*   **h8g8, h8f8, h8h7, e8f8, e8d8, e8e7, e8d7, a8b8, c8d7:** These are all king and rook moves. I don't want to move my king into danger, and the rooks don't seem to have immediate targets.
*   **g7f8:** This is a bishop move.
*   **f6d8, f6e7, f6g5, f6f5, f6e5, f6h4, f6f4, f6d4, f6f3:** These are knight moves. The knight on f6 is under attack. Moving it is probably a priority. f6e7 looks like a good option, developing the knight and getting it out of the way of the queen.
*   **d5e7, d5b6, d5f4, d5e3, d5c3:** These are pawn moves.
*   **b4c6, b4a6, b4d3, b4c2, b4a2:** These are pawn moves.
*   **c7c6, b7b6, a7a6, h6h5, g6g5, e6e5, c7c5, b7b5, a7a5:** These are pawn moves.

I think the best move here is to develop the knight and get it out of the way of the queen.

Alright, I have a lot of options. White's queen is a serious threat, so I need to address that. Moving the King seems too passive at this point. Developing the Bishop on c8 to d7 looks like a good developing move and potentially defends against some threats. Let's try that.

Alright, that's a lot of moves. Let's analyze them.

*   **Rook moves:** `h8g8, h8f8, h8h7, a8d8, a8c8, a8b8` - These are generally safe moves, developing the rooks. `h8h7` seems a bit passive.
*   **King moves:** `e8f8, e8d8` - The king is relatively safe where it is.
*   **Bishop moves:** `g7f8, g7f6, g7e5, g7d4, d7c8, d7c6, d7b5, d7a4` - The bishop on g7 has some interesting diagonal options. `g7f6` looks like a good developing move. `d7c6` and `d7b5` are also decent.
*   **Queen moves:** `e7f8, e7d8, e7f6, e7g5, e7h4` - The queen has a lot of options. `e7f6` attacks the knight, and `e7g5` could be interesting.
*   **Pawn moves:** `d5f6, d5b6, d5f4, d5e3, d5c3, b4c6, b4a6, b4d3, b4c2, b4a2, g6h5, f7f6, c7c6, b7b6, a7a6, g6g5, e6e5, f7f5, c7c5, b7b5` - Many pawn moves. `f7f6` is a standard pawn move. `c7c6` and `b7b6` are also good for pawn structure.
*   **Knight moves:** `b4c6, b4a6, b4d3, b4c2, b4a2` - the knight on b4 has some interesting options.

Considering the position, I think developing the bishop on g7 is a good idea. `g7f6` attacks the knight on f3 and opens up the diagonal for the queen.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Okay, I've got the list of legal moves. Let's analyze a bit. White's queen is a threat, but there are many things to consider.

*   **Queen moves:** The queen on e7 has several options, but moving it to f8 or d8 doesn't seem immediately helpful.
*   **Pawn moves:** Pushing the pawns could open up lines for the queen or other pieces.
*   **Bishop moves:** The bishop on d7 has some interesting diagonal options.
*   **Knight moves:** The knight on b4 has several options, but none seem immediately impactful.
*   **Rook moves:** The rooks on a8 and h8 have limited options.

I think I'll develop the bishop on d7 to a more active square. The move d7c6 looks good, as it attacks the white knight on f3 and prepares to control the center.

*   **e7d7:** This move looks interesting. It develops the queen and potentially opens the diagonal for the bishop.
*   **g6g5:** This move attacks the pawn on f4, but it also weakens the kingside.

Considering the position, I think developing the queen is the most important thing to do right now.

*   **...Nf6:** This develops the knight and controls important central squares.
*   **...b6:** This supports the pawn structure and prepares to develop the bishop.
*   **...e5:** This challenges white's control of the center.

Alright, I've got a lot of options. Let's think this through.

*   **King Safety:** My king is currently safe.
*   **Piece Activity:** My pieces are somewhat developed, but I need to improve their activity.
*   **Pawn Structure:** The pawn structure is relatively closed, but there are some potential weaknesses.
*   **Threats:** White doesn't seem to have any immediate threats.

Considering the position, I think a good developing move is to move the queen to a more active square. The move `d8e7` looks promising, as it develops the queen and potentially eyes the kingside.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Okay, I have a lot of options. Let's analyze them.

*   **King moves:** The king has limited options. Moving the king is usually not ideal early in the game.
*   **Rook moves:** The rooks on a8 and h8 have some movement possibilities, but they are not immediately threatening.
*   **Queen moves:** The queen on d8 has a lot of potential, but I need to be careful about where I place it.
*   **Bishop moves:** The bishops on c6 and f6 have some diagonals open.
*   **Knight moves:** The knight on b4 has several options.
*   **Pawn moves:** There are many pawn moves available.

Considering the position, I think I should develop my pieces and control the center. The knight on b4 looks like a good candidate for development. I'll move it to d3, attacking the pawn on c1 and controlling a central square.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, I have a good list of possible moves. Let's analyze them.

*   **King moves:** e8d8, e8d7, e8f8 - These don't seem immediately helpful. The king is relatively safe where it is for now.
*   **Rook moves:** h8g8, h8f8, h8h7, a8d8, a8c8, a8b8 - Developing the rooks is generally good, but the h-file rook is blocked. Moving the a-file rook might be a good idea to connect the rooks later.
*   **Queen moves:** e7f8, e7d8, e7d7 - The queen is well-placed, but moving it now doesn't seem to achieve much.
*   **Bishop moves:** c6d7, c6b7, c6b5, c6a4 - The bishop on c6 is somewhat passive. Moving it could open up some lines.
*   **Knight moves:** f6g7, f6g5, f6e5, f6h4, f6d4, b8d7, b8a6 - The knight on f6 is well-placed. Moving it could be useful.
*   **Pawn moves:** d5b6, d5f4, d5b4, d5e3, d5c3, g6h5, d6c5, a7a6, g6g5, e6e5, a7a5 - Pawn moves are important for controlling the center and supporting pieces.

Considering the position, I think developing the rook on a8 is a good idea. It opens up the a-file and could potentially connect with the other rook later. I'll move the rook to b8.

*   **...e8f8, ...e8d8, ...e8d7:** King moves are generally not ideal unless forced. d7 looks like the best of these, but still passive.
*   **...b8d8, ...b8c8, ...b8a8, ...b8b7:** These Queen moves don't seem to improve the position.
*   **...e7f8, ...e7d8, ...e7d7:** These pawn moves are not helpful.
*   **...f6g7, ...f6g5, ...f6e5, ...f6h4, ...f6d4:** Knight moves. ...Nf6d4 would be a good move, but it's not available. ...Nf6e5 looks interesting, attacking the Queen.
*   **...c6d7, ...c6b7, ...c6b5, ...c6a4:** These bishop moves are not helpful.
*   **...d5b6, ...d5f4, ...d5b4, ...d5e3, ...d5c3:** These pawn moves are not helpful.
*   **...g6h5:** This pawn move doesn't seem to help.
*   **...d6c5:** This pawn move is not helpful.
*   **...a7a6, ...g6g5, ...e6e5, ...a7a5:** These pawn moves are not helpful.

...Nf6e5 looks like the best move here. It attacks the White Queen and develops the Knight to a good square.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, that's a lot of options. Let's break this down. White's Queen on d4 is a major threat. I need to consider moves that either defend against it, or develop a counter-attack.

*   **Defensive Moves:** Moving the King (e8f8, e8d8, e8d7) is tempting, but it doesn't develop anything and might just lead to further pressure. Moving the Rook (h8g8, h8f8, h8h7) is also not ideal as it doesn't help with the immediate threat.
*   **Developing Moves:** Moving the Bishop (c6d7, c6b7, c6b5, c6a4) could be useful, but doesn't directly address the Queen.
*   **Pawn Moves:** Pushing pawns (f7f6, a7a6, g6g5, f7f5, a7a5) are generally not the best as they don't develop pieces and can weaken the position.
*   **Knight Moves:** The Knight on b8 has several options (b8d8, b8c8, b8a8, b8b7).
*   **Bishop Moves:** The Bishop on e7 has several options (e7f8, e7d8, e7d7, e7f6, e7g5, e7h4).
*   **Pawn Moves:** The pawn on d5 has several options (d5f6, d5b6, d5f4, d5b4, d5e3, d5c3).

The most promising move seems to be developing the Knight to d7 (b8d7) to defend against the Queen and potentially prepare for a counter-attack. It also opens up the diagonal for the Bishop on c8.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

You are absolutely right! My apologies. I misread the board. The Knight on b8 is blocked by the pawn on b7. I need to re-evaluate.

Let's look at the options again, focusing on immediate threats and development. The Queen on d4 is still the biggest problem.

*   **Bishop Moves:** The Bishop on e7 has several options (e7f8, e7d8, e7d7, e7f6, e7g5, e7h4). Moving the Bishop to f6 (e7f6) directly attacks the Queen and develops the piece. This seems like the best option.

Okay, I've reviewed the board and the legal moves. White has a strong attack developing, and I need to be careful. My queen on d6 is under pressure, and I need to find a safe square for it. I also need to develop my pieces and try to create some counterplay.

I think the best move here is to move the queen to a safer square while also potentially eyeing an attack on the kingside.

Therefore, I will move my queen to d7.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, I've got a lot of options. White's queen is a threat, and I need to address that. I see several defensive moves and some developing moves.

*   **h8h7:** This is a simple pawn move to protect the back rank.
*   **e7f6:** This develops the pawn and challenges the center.
*   **e7g5:** This is an interesting move, attacking the knight and potentially opening lines for my queen.
*   **d6c5:** This attacks the center and opens the diagonal for my bishop.
*   **f7f6:** This supports the pawn structure.
*   **a7a6/a7a5:** These are pawn moves that don't seem to do much immediately.
*   **g6h5/g6g5:** These are pawn moves that don't seem to do much immediately.
*   **f7f5:** This is a pawn move that doesn't seem to do much immediately.

I think the most active move is to develop my pawn and attack the center. I'll play **e7f6**.

Okay, I have a lot of options. Let's analyze.

*   **Queen moves:** The queen on g7 has many options, but I should be careful not to leave it exposed.
*   **Pawn moves:** I see pawn moves on the a, f, and h files.
*   **Bishop moves:** The bishop on c6 has some interesting diagonal options.
*   **King moves:** The king has a few moves, but I don't want to move it into danger.
*   **Other moves:** I also have some pawn moves available.

I see that the white queen on f1 is a potential threat. I need to develop my pieces and control the center. I think I'll develop my bishop to control the long diagonal and put some pressure on white's position.

I'll move my bishop from c6 to b5.

Okay, I've reviewed the legal moves. My queen on d8 is a powerful piece. I see a few interesting possibilities.

*   **Qxh8**: This wins the rook, but it allows White to recapture with their queen, and the resulting position might not be as advantageous as it seems.
*   **Qh4**: This attacks the king directly, and forces a response.
*   **...g5**: This weakens White's kingside pawn structure and opens lines for my rook.

I think the most forcing move is Qh4. It immediately puts pressure on White and forces them to react.

My apologies, I made a mistake. I need to be more careful. I'll try again, this time making sure the move is legal. Let me re-evaluate. The queen on d8 can't move to h4 because it's blocked by my own pawn on g7.

*   **d5f6, d5b6, d5f4, d5b4, d5e3, d5c3**: The bishop moves are interesting. They could potentially create some counterplay.
*   **b5c6, b5a6, b5c4, b5a4, b5d3, b5e2, b5f1**: The bishop moves are interesting. They could potentially create some counterplay.
*   **f7f6, c7c6, a7a6, f7f5, a7a5**: These pawn moves don't seem to address the immediate threats.

The most promising seems to be to develop the bishop to try and create some counterplay. I'll try **Bf6**.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, I've got a lot of options. White's queen on f2 is a threat, and I need to address that. My knight on f6 is well-placed, but I need to be careful about how I use it. Let's consider a few moves:

*   **...Qf8:** This defends the king and develops the queen. It also opens up the possibility of a counterattack.
*   **...Nf6-d7:** This develops the knight and prepares to challenge the center.
*   **...c7-c6:** This supports the pawn on d6 and prepares to develop the queen's bishop.

I think the most pressing issue is the threat to my king. Moving the queen to f8 seems like the most solid response.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, I've got a lot of options. Let's analyze them.

*   **King moves:** `f8g8`, `f8e8`, `f8e7` - Moving the King doesn't seem to help much, and exposes it further.
*   **Rook moves:** `b8e8`, `b8d8`, `b8c8`, `b8a8`, `b8b7` - These moves don't immediately address the threat.
*   **Pawn moves:** `h7h8`, `h7h6`, `g7h6`, `c7c6`, `a7a6`, `d6d5`, `a7a5` - Pushing the h-pawn to h6 or the g-pawn to h6 seems like a reasonable defensive move. `c7c6` and `a7a6` are passive. `d6d5` is interesting, but might open up the position too much.
*   **Knight moves:** `f6g8`, `f6e8`, `f6d7`, `f6h5`, `f6d5`, `f6g4`, `f6e4` - The knight is well-placed, but moving it doesn't seem to improve the situation immediately.
*   **Queen moves:** `b5e8`, `b5d7`, `b5c6`, `b5a6`, `b5c4`, `b5a4`, `b5d3`, `b5e2`, `b5f1` - Moving the Queen is interesting. `b5d7` attacks the white Queen, but it might be a trap.
*   **Pawn moves:** `e5f4`, `e5d4`, `e5g3` - These moves don't seem to help.

Considering the immediate threats, I think I should try to defend the h-file and develop a piece. Pushing the h-pawn to h6 seems like a good start.

Alright, I've got a list of legal moves. Let's analyze them. Black's king is currently under some pressure, and the queen is also a threat. I need to consider both defense and counterplay.

*   **Defensive Considerations:** The most immediate threat seems to be the white queen. I need to make sure my king is safe.
*   **Candidate Moves:**
    *   `f8g8`: Moving the rook to defend the king. This seems like a reasonable defensive move.
    *   `f8e7`: Another rook move to defend the king.
    *   `g7h8`: Moving the pawn to protect the king.
    *   `g7g6`: Moving the pawn to protect the king.
    *   `h6h7`: Moving the knight.
    *   `d6c5`: Moving the pawn.
    *   `c7c6`: Moving the pawn.
    *   `d6d5`: Moving the pawn.

Considering the position, I think the best move is to move the rook to defend the king and develop a piece.

*   **g7g6:** This move blocks the h-file, but it doesn't develop a piece.
*   **f6h7:** This develops the knight, but it doesn't immediately address the threats.
*   **d6c5:** This challenges the center and opens lines for the Queen.

I'm leaning towards **g8h7** to develop the rook and defend the h-file. Let's make that move.

*   **Defensive Considerations:** I need to defend against the immediate threats. Moving the queen is a priority.

*   **Candidate Moves:**
    *   `b8h8`: This move seems to block the rook's attack on the king and develop the rook.
    *   `g7g6`: This move defends the pawn on g7.
    *   `d6c5`: This move attacks the pawn on b4.

After considering the options, I think the best move is to develop the rook and block the check.

Okay, I see the board. It's a complex position with a lot of pieces still on the board. White has a strong attack brewing, and I need to be careful. I'll get a list of my legal moves.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, I have a good number of options. Let's analyze a bit. White's queen and rook on the h-file are a threat. I need to consider how to defend against that. My king is relatively safe for now. I also need to think about developing my pieces and potentially counterattacking.

The move ...Qg7 looks interesting, as it develops the queen and defends the h7 square. However, it might be a bit passive.

...Nf8 doesn't seem to do much.

...Bh6 is a possibility, but it might block my own rook.

...d5 looks like a good centralizing move, challenging white's control of the center.

...c6 is a solid move, supporting the pawn structure.

...g6 might be useful to prevent a white knight from jumping to f5.

I think I'll go with **...d5**. It challenges the center and opens up lines for my pieces.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, I've got a lot of options. White's queen is a major threat. Let's analyze a few of the more promising moves:

*   **...Qg7:** This seems like a reasonable move. It develops the queen, defends the king, and potentially eyes the kingside.
*   **...Bf8:** This develops the bishop and could help defend the king.
*   **...h6g6:** This is a pawn move that could help to defend the king.

I think developing the queen is the best move here.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, I have a lot of options. White's queen and rook on the e-file are a major threat. My immediate concern is the potential for a quick checkmate. I need to consider moves that defend against this.

*   **h6h5:** This pawn move doesn't seem to help much defensively.
*   **g5g4:** This pawn move opens the g-file, which could be dangerous.
*   **c7c6:** This pawn move doesn't seem to address the immediate threats.
*   **b5 moves:** These bishop moves are interesting. Developing the bishop could be helpful.
*   **e5 moves:** These bishop moves could also be useful.
*   **f6 moves:** These knight moves are also interesting.
*   **h8 moves:** These rook moves are also interesting.

I'm leaning towards developing my bishop to try and create some counterplay and defend against the immediate threats. Specifically, I like the idea of developing my bishop to f8 to defend the back rank.

Therefore, I will make the move h8f8.

Okay, that's a lot of moves. Let's analyze them.

*   **King moves:** No safe king moves.
*   **Rook moves:** The rook on h7 can move to h8 or g7, but those don't seem to help much.
*   **Bishop moves:** The bishop on f8 has several moves, but none immediately address the threats. The bishop on b5 has many moves, but none seem to be a good defense.
*   **Knight moves:** The knight on g6 has several moves.
*   **Queen moves:** The queen on g8 has several moves.
*   **Pawn moves:** The pawn on h6 can move to h5, but it doesn't help. The pawn on c7 can move to c6. The pawn on g5 can move to g4. The pawn on e5 has several moves.

The most pressing issue is the attack on my king. I need to find a move that develops a piece and defends. The knight on g6 looks like a good option. Moving it to e4 attacks the white bishop on f1 and defends against a potential attack.

*   **...Bf1** looks interesting, but it doesn't immediately address the threat.
*   **...g5g4** seems like a good pawn push to challenge the center.
*   **...c7c6** is a solid move, supporting the pawn structure.

Alright, I've got a lot of options. Let's analyze.

*   **Rook moves:** The rook on h7 has several options, but none seem particularly strong immediately.
*   **Bishop moves:** The bishop on f8 has a lot of potential, but needs to develop. The bishop on b5 has some interesting diagonals.
*   **Knight moves:** The knight on f6 has some decent options, but nothing immediately threatening.
*   **Pawn moves:** c7-c6 looks like a solid developing move. e5-d6 or e5-d4 could open lines.
*   **Queen moves:** The queen on e4 has a lot of options, but is currently under attack.
*   **King moves:** The king is safe for now.

The queen on e4 is a problem. I need to address that. I think the best move here is to move the queen to safety.

Okay, I see the board. White has a strong attack developing, and my king is a bit exposed. Let's get a list of my legal moves.

f8h8,f8g8,f8e8,f8d8,f8c8,f8b8,h7h8,h7g8,h7g7,h6g6,h6h5,f6g8,f6e8,f6d7,f6h5,f6e4,e5d6,e5f4,e5d4,e5g3,b5d7,b5c6,b5a6,b5c4,b5a4,b5d3,e3g5,e3f4,e3e4,e3d4,e3g3,e3f3,e3d3,e3f2,e3e2,e3d2,e3e1,e3c1,g4h3,c7c6

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, that's a lot of moves. Let's analyze them. White's queen is a major threat. I need to address that.

*   **f8h8, f8g8, f8e8, f8d8, f8c8, f8b8:** Moving the bishop doesn't seem to help much immediately.
*   **h7h8, h7g8, h7g7:** Moving the pawn doesn't seem to help much immediately.
*   **h6g6, h6h5:** Moving the knight doesn't seem to help much immediately.
*   **f6g8, f6e8, f6d7, f6h5, f6e4:** Moving the knight doesn't seem to help much immediately.
*   **e5d6, e5f4, e5d4, e5g3:** Moving the pawn doesn't seem to help much immediately.
*   **b5d7, b5c6, b5a6, b5c4, b5a4, b5d3:** Moving the bishop doesn't seem to help much immediately.
*   **e3g5, e3f4, e3e4, e3d4, e3g3, e3f3, e3d3, e3f2, e3e2, e3d2, e3e1, e3c1:** Moving the bishop doesn't seem to help much immediately.
*   **g4h3:** Moving the pawn doesn't seem to help much immediately.
*   **c7c6:** This seems like a reasonable move to protect the pawn on d5 and prepare to develop the queen.

I think c7c6 is the most solid move here. It doesn't immediately solve all my problems, but it strengthens my position and prepares for future development.

f8h8,f8g8,f8e8,f8d8,f8c8,f8b8,h7h8,h7g8,h7g7,h6g6,h6h5,f6g8,f6e8,f6d7,f6h5,f6e4,e5b8,e5c7,e5d6,e5f4,e5d4,e5g3,b5a6,b5c4,b5a4,b5d3,e3g5,e3f4,e3e4,e3d4,e3g3,e3f3,e3d3,e3f2,e3e2,e3d2,e3e1,e3c1,g4h3

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, that's a lot of moves to consider. Let's break it down and analyze the most promising options.

*   **Developing the Bishop on f8:** Moves like f8h8, f8g8, f8e8, f8d8, f8c8, f8b8 don't seem to immediately address the threats.
*   **Pawn moves:** h7h8, h7g8, h7g7, h6g6, h6h5, b5a6, b5c4, b5a4, b5d3, g4h3 are mostly defensive or don't contribute to development.
*   **Knight moves:** f6g8, f6e8, f6d7, f6h5, f6e4, are interesting. f6e4 looks like it could attack the white queen, but it leaves the knight vulnerable. f6d7 could be a good developing move.
*   **Bishop moves:** e5b8, e5c7, e5d6, e5f4, e5d4, e5g3. e5d6 looks like a good developing move, putting pressure on the center.
*   **Pawn moves:** e3g5, e3f4, e3e4, e3d4, e3g3, e3f3, e3d3, e3f2, e3e2, e3d2, e3e1, e3c1 are not relevant.

Considering the position, I think **e5d6** is the best move. It develops the bishop to a good square, controls important squares in the center, and prepares for further development.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, that's a lot of moves to consider. White's queen is a threat, and I need to address that. Let's analyze the options:

*   **King moves:** Moving the king doesn't seem immediately helpful.
*   **Rook moves:** Rook moves are limited and don't seem to directly address the immediate threats.
*   **Bishop moves:** The bishop on f8 has a few options, but none seem to offer immediate defense. The bishop on d6 has more options, but most of them don't seem to help.
*   **Knight moves:** The knight on f6 has some interesting options.
*   **Pawn moves:** Pawn moves are limited.
*   **Queen moves:** The queen is the biggest threat.

I think the most important thing is to develop a counter-attack and try to neutralize the queen. The knight on f6 can attack the queen. Let's move the knight to e4, attacking the queen and opening a line for the bishop on d6.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, that's a lot of moves. Let's analyze them.

*   **Rook moves (h7):** Moving the rook doesn't seem to help much right now.
*   **Bishop moves (d6):** The bishop on d6 has a lot of options. Moving it to e7 or c7 seems passive. Moving it to e5 attacks the knight, but white can recapture. Moving it to c5 looks interesting, putting pressure on the queen.
*   **Pawn moves (f7):** Pushing the f-pawn doesn't seem to accomplish much.
*   **Pawn moves (e4):** The pawn on e4 has some interesting moves.
*   **Pawn moves (b5):** The pawn on b5 has some interesting moves.
*   **Pawn moves (h6):** The pawn on h6 has some interesting moves.
*   **Pawn moves (e3):** The pawn on e3 has some interesting moves.

I think the most active move is to develop the bishop and put pressure on the queen.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, that's a lot of moves. Let's analyze the most critical ones.

*   **f8h8, f8g8, f8e8, f8d8, f8c8, f8b8, f8a8:** Moving the rook on f8. These are mostly passive moves.
*   **h7h8, h7g8, h7g7:** Moving the pawn on h7. This doesn't seem to help much.
*   **h6g6, h6f6, h6e6, h6d6, h6h5:** Moving the pawn on h6. This doesn't seem to help much.
*   **c5a7, c5d6, c5b6, c5d4, c5b4:** Moving the bishop on c5. This bishop is currently blocked.
*   **b5a6, b5c4, b5a4, b5d3:** Moving the bishop on b5. This bishop is currently blocked.
*   **e4f6, e4d6, e4g5, e4g3, e4c3, e4f2, e4d2:** Moving the knight on e4. The knight is under attack and needs to move.
*   **e3g5, e3f4, e3d4, e3g3, e3f3, e3d3, e3f2, e3e2, e3d2, e3e1, e3c1:** Moving the bishop on e3. This bishop is currently blocked.
*   **f7f6, f7f5:** Moving the pawn on f7. This doesn't seem to help much.

The knight on e4 is under attack by the white pawn on f5. I need to move it. Moving it to d6 (e4d6) seems like a reasonable option, defending the pawn on f7 and potentially eyeing the white queen.

*   **Pawn moves:** Pushing the f-pawn seems like a reasonable option to challenge white's control of the center.
*   **Knight moves:** The knight on d6 has several options, but none seem immediately helpful.
*   **Pawn moves:** Pushing the pawn on f7 to f6 or f5. f6 seems more solid.

I'll play f7-f6 to try and solidify the position.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, that's a lot of moves. White's attack is the priority. I need to find a move that addresses the immediate threats.

*   **f8h8, f8g8, f8e8, f8d8, f8c8, f8b8, f8a8, f8f7:** Moving the Rook doesn't seem to help much against the immediate threats.
*   **h7h8, h7g8, h7g7:** Moving the pawn doesn't seem to help much against the immediate threats.
*   **h6g6, h6h5:** Moving the pawn doesn't seem to help much against the immediate threats.
*   **d6e8, d6c8, d6f7, d6b7, d6f5, d6e4, d6c4:** Moving the Knight. Some of these moves could be useful for defense or counterplay.
*   **c5a7, c5b6, c5d4, c5b4:** Moving the Bishop. Doesn't seem to help much.
*   **b5a6, b5c4, b5a4, b5d3, b5e2, b5f1:** Moving the Bishop. Doesn't seem to help much.
*   **e3e8, e3e7, e3e6, e3g5, e3e5, e3f4, e3e4, e3d4, e3g3, e3f3, e3d3, e3c3, e3f2, e3e2, e3d2, e3e1, e3c1:** Moving the Pawn. Doesn't seem to help much.
*   **f6f5:** Moving the pawn. Doesn't seem to help much.

The Knight on d6 seems to be the most flexible piece to defend against the threats. I think **Nd6f5** is a good move. It attacks the Queen and defends the King.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Okay, I've got a lot of options. Let's analyze the most critical ones. White's queen and knight are posing a serious threat.

*   **...Rf8-h8:** This seems like a reasonable defensive move, getting the rook out of the line of fire.
*   **...h7-h5:** This could challenge White's control of the g4 square, but it doesn't immediately address the threats.
*   **...f5-f4:** This could open the f-file, but it also weakens the pawn structure around the king.
*   **...c5-d4:** This could be interesting, attacking the knight and opening the diagonal for the bishop.
*   **...e3-e2:** This looks like a desperate attempt to sacrifice the pawn and try to create some counterplay.

Considering the immediate threats and the need to defend the king, I think the best move is to move the rook to h8.

*   **h8g8, h8f8, h8e8, h8d8, h8c8, h8b8, h8a8:** Moving the Rook doesn't seem to help much in the short term.
*   **h7g8, h7g7, h6g6, h6h5:** Pushing the pawns doesn't seem to help either.
*   **f5g7, f5e7, f5d6, f5h4, f5d4, f5g3:** Moving the Bishop is interesting. f5d6 could be a good defensive move.
*   **c5f8, c5e7, c5a7, c5d6, c5b6, c5d4, c5b4:** Moving the Bishop is interesting. c5d6 could be a good defensive move.
*   **b5a6, b5c4, b5a4, b5d3, b5e2, b5f1:** Moving the Bishop is interesting.
*   **e3e8, e3e7, e3e6, e3e5, e3f4, e3e4, e3d4, e3g3, e3f3, e3d3, e3c3, e3b3, e3a3, e3f2, e3e2, e3d2, e3g1, e3e1, e3c1:** Moving the pawn doesn't seem to help much in the short term.

I think the best move here is to develop my Bishop to d6. This defends against the immediate threats and develops a piece.

*   **Rook moves (h8...):** Moving the rook doesn't seem to immediately help.
*   **Pawn moves (h7g8, h6g6, c6c5):** c6c5 looks interesting, challenging the center. h6h5 and h7g7 are passive.
*   **Bishop moves (d6...):** The bishop on d6 has a lot of potential moves, but none seem to immediately address the threats.
*   **Bishop moves (f5...):** The bishop on f5 has a lot of potential moves, but none seem to immediately address the threats.
*   **Pawn moves (b5...):** b5a4, b5c4, b5d3, b5e2, b5f1 are not good moves.
*   **Queen moves (e3...):** The queen moves are not good.
*   **c6c5:** This challenges the center and opens a line for the bishop on f5. It also restricts white's pawn advances.

I think c6c5 is the best move. It's active and develops a pawn.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Okay, that's a lot of moves. Let's analyze the most promising ones.

*   **Rook moves (h8):** The rook on h8 has many options, but none seem immediately impactful. Moving it along the back rank doesn't improve the position significantly.
*   **Pawn moves (g7, h6):** Pushing the g-pawn to g8 to promote to a queen is an interesting idea, but it would take several moves. h6-h7 is a passive move.
*   **Bishop moves (d6):** The bishop on d6 has some interesting diagonals. Moving it to f8 could put pressure on the white king, but it's a long-term plan.
*   **Pawn moves (f5):** The f5 pawn has some interesting options. f5-e7 is not useful. f5-h4 is a bit of a strange move. f5-d4 and f5-g3 are not good.
*   **Bishop moves (b5):** The bishop on b5 has some interesting diagonals. Moving it to d7 or c6 could put pressure on the white king, but it's a long-term plan.
*   **Queen moves (e3):** The queen on e3 has many options. e3-e8, e3-e7, e3-e6, e3-e5, e3-f4, e3-e4, e3-d4, e3-g3, e3-f3, e3-d3, e3-f2, e3-e2, e3-d2, e3-g1, e3-e1, e3-c1.
*   **Pawn moves (c5):** c5-d4, c5-b4, c5-c4.

Considering the position, I think I should try to activate my queen and put some pressure on the white king. The move **Qe3-e5** looks like a good developing move, attacking the pawn on g5 and opening lines for the queen.

*   **Threats:** White is clearly threatening mate. The most immediate threat seems to be Qh6#. I need to address this.
*   **Defensive Options:**
    *   ...h7 blocks the immediate mate threat.
*   **Counterplay:**
    *   ...e4 looks interesting, attacking the queen and opening the position.
    *   ...c4 looks interesting, attacking the queen and opening the position.

Considering the immediate threat, I'll prioritize defense.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, I have a lot of options. White is threatening my king with the rook on h1 and the queen on d4. I need to defend against these threats.

Let's analyze some candidate moves:

*   **h7h6:** This move defends against the rook on h1.
*   **h7h5:** This move also defends against the rook on h1, and opens up a potential escape square for the king.
*   **e5e6:** This move blocks the queen's attack on the king.
*   **e5e4:** This move attacks the queen, forcing her to move.
*   **c5c4:** This move challenges white's control of the center.

Considering the threats and the need to develop my pieces, I think **h7h6** is a solid defensive move. It prevents the immediate checkmate threat and gives me time to assess the situation further.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, I've got a list of legal moves. The position is quite complex. White's queen is a threat, but I have some active pieces. Let's analyze a bit.

*   **Rook on h8:** Moving the rook seems passive for now.
*   **Pawn on h6:** Moving the pawn to h5 could be interesting, but it doesn't seem to immediately improve my position.
*   **Bishop on d6:** The bishop has some interesting diagonals.
*   **Pawn on g7:** Moving the pawn to g6 or g8 doesn't seem to help.
*   **Queen on e5:** The queen is well-placed, but needs to be protected.
*   **Bishop on b5:** The bishop is a good piece.
*   **Pawn on c5:** This pawn is a target.
*   **Pawn on d5:** This pawn is also a target.
*   **Pawn on f5:** This pawn is also a target.

I think I need to address the threat to my pawns and try to develop my pieces. The move **...Bc6** looks promising. It attacks the white queen, develops the bishop, and potentially opens the diagonal for my queen.

*   **Bishop moves:** The bishop on c6 has a lot of potential moves, but none immediately address the threat.
*   **Pawn moves:** h6-h5 seems like a good move to try and create some space for the king.
*   **Queen moves:** The queen on d6 has a lot of options, but none immediately address the threat.
*   **Pawn moves:** d5-d4 seems like a good move to try and create some space for the king.
*   **Pawn moves:** g4-h3 seems like a good move to try and create some space for the king.
*   **Queen moves:** The queen on e5 has a lot of options, but none immediately address the threat.

I think the most promising move is to try and create some space for the king and develop a piece. I'll move the pawn on h6 to h5.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, that's a lot of moves. Let's analyze the most critical threats and possibilities. White's queen on f5 is a major problem. The immediate threats are to the king. I need to find a move that either deflects the queen or protects the king.

*   **h8g8, h8f8, h8e8, h8h7, h8h6:** Moving the rook doesn't seem to help much, and it might even open up lines for the white queen.
*   **g7g8, g7f8, g7h7, g7h6:** Pawn moves are not helpful.
*   **d6f8, d6b8, d6e7, d6c7, d6c5:** Moving the bishop is not helpful.
*   **c6e8, c6a8, c6d7, c6b7, c6b5, c6a4:** Moving the bishop is not helpful.
*   **h5h7, h5h6, h5g5, h5h4, h5h3:** Pawn moves are not helpful.
*   **f5e7, f5h6, f5h4, f5d4, f5g3, f5e3:** These are all potential captures of the white queen. Capturing the queen with the pawn on e5 seems like the best option.
*   **e5e8, e5e7, e5e6, e5f4, e5e4, e5d4, e5c3, e5b2, e5a1:** Moving the queen is not helpful.
*   **d5e4, g4h3, d5d4:** These are not helpful.

The best move seems to be to capture the white queen with the pawn on e5. This will relieve some of the pressure on the king.

You are a professional chess player and you play as black. Now is your turn to make a move. Before making a move you can pick one of the following actions:
- 'get_current_board' to get the schema and current status of the board
- 'get_legal_moves' to get a UCI formatted list of available moves
- 'make_move <UCI formatted move>' when you are ready to complete your turn (e.g., 'make_move e2e4')

Okay, I see the board. White has a strong attack developing, especially with the Queen and Rook on the open file. Black's King is somewhat exposed. I need to find a move that addresses the immediate threats and improves Black's position. Let's get the legal moves.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Okay, that's a lot of moves. Let's analyze the most critical ones.

*   **h8g8, h8f8, h8e8, h8h7, h8h6:** These are Rook moves. Moving the Rook doesn't seem to immediately address the threats.
*   **g7g8, g7f8, g7h7, g7h6:** Pawn moves. Pushing the pawn doesn't seem to help much.
*   **d6f8, d6b8, d6e7, d6c7, d6e5, d6c5:** Bishop moves. The Bishop on d6 is important. Moving it to f8 or b8 is passive. e7 or c7 are also not great. e5 or c5 might be interesting, but let's look at other options first.
*   **c6e8, c6a8, c6d7, c6b7, c6b5, c6a4:** Bishop moves. The Bishop on c6 is also important. Moving it to e8 or a8 is passive. d7 is also not great. b7, b5, or a4 might be interesting, but let's look at other options first.
*   **h5h7, h5h6, h5g5, h5h4, h5h3:** Pawn moves. Pushing the pawn doesn't seem to help much.
*   **f5e7, f5h6, f5h4, f5d4, f5g3, f5e3:** Queen moves. The Queen is very active. Moving the Queen to e7 is passive. h6 is interesting, but it might be too slow. h4, d4, g3, and e3 are all potentially interesting, and could create some counterplay.
*   **f4h6, f4g5, f4e5, f4e4, f4d4, f4c4, f4b4, f4g3, f4f3, f4e3, f4d2, f4c1:** Pawn moves. Pushing the pawn doesn't seem to help much.
*   **g4h3, g4f3:** Pawn moves. Pushing the pawn doesn't seem to help much.
*   **d5d4:** Pawn move. This opens the diagonal for the Bishop on c6.

Considering the threats, I think the most active and promising move is to develop a counterattack. The Queen on f5 has a lot of potential. I'll move the Queen to h4, attacking the White Rook and potentially creating some tactical complications.

Okay, I've got a lot of options. White's queen is a major threat. Let's analyze the most promising moves.

*   **...h8h7:** This seems like a reasonable defensive move, preventing a potential back-rank mate.
*   **...d5d4:** This pawn push challenges the center and opens lines for my pieces.
*   **...f4f3:** This attacks the rook and opens the f-file.
*   **...h4g2:** This attacks the rook and opens the h-file.

I think the most active and promising move is to challenge the center and open lines with **...d5d4**. This forces White to react and gives me more options.

Okay, I have a lot of options. Let's analyze the most critical threats. White's queen on f6 is a major problem. I need to find a way to defend against it.

*   **h8g8, h8f8, h8e8, h8d8, h8c8, h8b8, h8a8:** Moving the rook doesn't seem to address the immediate threat.
*   **h8h7, h8h6:** These moves don't help either.
*   **g7g8, g7f8, g7h7, g7f7, g7h6, g7g6:** Promoting the pawn to a queen is tempting, but it's likely to be captured immediately.
*   **d6f8, d6b8, d6e7, d6c7, d6e5, d6c5:** The bishop moves don't seem to help.
*   **h5h7, h5h6, h5g5, h5f5, h5e5, h5d5, h5c5:** These pawn moves don't help.
*   **h4g6, h4f5, h4f3, h4g2:** The knight moves don't seem to help.
*   **f4h6, f4g5, f4f5, f4e5, f4e4, f4g3, f4f3, f4e3, f4f2, f4d2, f4c1:** The pawn moves don't seem to help.
*   **g4h3:** This knight move doesn't seem to help.
*   **f6f5:** This pawn move seems to be the best option. It blocks the queen's attack on the king and opens a line for the bishop.
*   **d4d3:** This pawn move doesn't seem to help.

Therefore, the best move is to push the pawn to f5.

Okay, I've reviewed the legal moves. The most pressing issue is the attack on the king. The rook on h8 is currently undefended and under threat. I can move the rook to a safer square, but that doesn't solve the immediate threat.

The queen on d6 has several options, but none seem to immediately alleviate the pressure.

The pawn on d4 can move to d3. This blocks the white queen's attack on the king.

Let's move the pawn to d3.

- 'get_current_board' to get the schema and current status of the board
- 'get_legal_moves' to get a UCI formatted list of available moves
- 'make_move <UCI formatted move>' when you are ready to complete your turn (e.g., 'make_move e2e4')

Okay, I've reviewed the legal moves. White is threatening my pawn on f4 with their queen. I need to address this immediately. The best move seems to be to move the pawn to f3, attacking the queen and forcing a trade or a retreat.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, I have a lot of options. Let's analyze.

*   **Rook moves:** The rook moves on g8 are not immediately helpful. The rook on h8 is also not doing much.
*   **Pawn moves:** h5-h4 looks interesting, potentially opening the h-file for an attack. f5-f4 is also a possibility, but it weakens my pawn structure.
*   **Bishop moves:** The bishop on d6 has a lot of options, but none of them seem to immediately improve my position.
*   **Knight moves:** The knight on f3 is under attack. Moving it to e4 looks like a good option to defend the pawn on f5.
*   **King moves:** The king is in a dangerous position, but there are no safe squares to move to.

I think the best move here is to defend my pawn on f5 and develop my knight.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, that's a lot of moves. Let's analyze them.

*   **Rook moves:** The rook moves don't seem to help much in the immediate situation.
*   **Bishop moves:** The bishop on d6 has some interesting options. Capturing the pawn on e5 with the bishop (d6e5) seems tempting, but it allows white to recapture with the queen and continue the attack.
*   **Pawn moves:** The pawn moves are mostly defensive, but don't seem to solve the immediate threats.
*   **Queen moves:** The queen has many moves, but none of them seem to be helpful.

The most critical threat is the white Queen on e5. I need to find a way to defend against it. The bishop on d6 can attack the queen.

I'll move the Bishop on d6 to e5, attacking the white Queen.

*   **Rook moves (g7h8, g7f8, g7h7, g7f7, g7g6, g7f6):** These moves are also not immediately helpful.
*   **Pawn moves (h5h8, h5h7, h5h6, h5g5, h5h4):** Pushing the h-pawn doesn't seem to help.
*   **Bishop moves (e5b8, e5c7, e5f6, e5d6, e5f4, e5d4, e5c3, e5b2):** The bishop on e5 is important. Moving it to b8, c7, f6, or d6 doesn't seem to improve the position. Moving it to f4 attacks the white queen, which is interesting.
*   **Queen moves (e4a8, e4b7, e4c6, e4d5, e4f4, e4d4, e4c4, e4b4, e4a4, e4f3, e4e3, e4g2, e4e2, e4h1):** The queen is currently under attack. Moving it to f4 is a good option.
*   **Pawn moves (d3e2, d3d2):** These moves are not good.

The best move seems to be to move the queen to f4, attacking the white queen and developing a threat.

Alright, I've got a lot of options. Let's analyze them.

*   **Rook moves:** The rook on g8 has a lot of moves, but none of them seem to immediately help. Moving it to h8, f8, or e8 doesn't improve the situation. Moving it to g7 doesn't seem to help either.
*   **Pawn moves:** The pawn on g6 has a few moves. g6g7 is not a good move. g6h7, g6f7, g6h6, g6f6, g6g5 are all bad moves.
*   **Bishop moves:** The bishop on e5 has a lot of moves. e5h8, e5b8, e5g7, e5c7, e5f6, e5d6, e5d4, e5c3, e5b2 are all bad moves.
*   **Pawn moves:** The pawn on f4 has a lot of moves. f4h6, f4g5, f4e4, f4d4, f4c4, f4b4, f4a4, f4g3, f4f3, f4e3, f4f2, f4d2, f4f1, f4c1 are all bad moves.

The position is very difficult. I need to find a move that doesn't immediately lose material or allow a checkmate. The only move that seems to offer any chance of survival is to move the rook to g7. This doesn't solve the problem, but it might delay the inevitable.

You are a professional chess player and you play as black. Now is your turn to make a move. Before making a move you can pick one of the following actions:

Okay, I see the board. Black's king is in a precarious position. White has a strong attack, especially with the Queen eyeing the kingside. I need to find a move that addresses the immediate threats and tries to develop a counterplay. Let's see what moves are available.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Okay, I've got the legal moves. The most pressing issue is the threat to the king. The white queen is a major threat. I need to find a move that defends the king and ideally develops a piece or creates some counterplay.

Let's analyze the options:

*   **g7g8=Q/R/B/N:** Promoting the pawn on g7 is tempting, but it doesn't immediately solve the king safety issue.
*   **g7h7, g7f7, g7e7, g7d7:** These pawn moves don't help the king.
*   **g6f7, g6f6, g6h5:** These pawn moves don't help either.
*   **e5b8, e5c7, e5f6, e5d6, e5d4, e5c3, e5b2:** The queen moves are interesting, but they don't address the immediate threat.
*   **f4h6, f4g5, f4e4, f4d4, f4c4, f4b4, f4a4, f4g3, f4f3, f4e3, f4f2, f4d2, f4f1, f4c1:** These bishop moves are also not helpful.

The best move here seems to be to move the pawn to defend the king.

Alright, I have a few options.

*   **g7g8=Q/R/B/N:** Promoting the pawn on g7 is tempting, but the immediate threats are too pressing to spend a tempo on that.
*   **g7h7, g7g6, g7g5:** These pawn moves don't help much.
*   **f7g8=Q/R/B/N, f7f8=Q/R/B/N, f7e7, f7g6, f7f6:** Similar to the g-pawn, these don't address the immediate danger.
*   **e5b8, e5c7, e5f6, e5d6, e5d4, e5c3, e5b2:** The Bishop on e5 has some interesting diagonal options, but none of them seem to immediately solve the problem.
*   **f4h6, f4g5, f4e4, f4d4, f4c4, f4b4, f4a4, f4g3, f4f3, f4e3, f4f2, f4d2, f4f1, f4c1:** The Bishop on f4 has many options, but none of them seem to be a good move.

The most pressing threat is the Queen and Rook on the open file. I need to find a way to defend the King. The most promising move seems to be to move the pawn on g7 to g6, to try to block the attack.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Okay, I have the legal moves. Let's analyze them.

*   **g8f8, g8h7:** King moves. Not ideal, as the king is relatively safe.
*   **g6g7, g6h6, g6f6, g6e6, g6d6, g6c6, g6b6, g6a6:** Rook moves. The rook on g7 is currently pinned by the white bishop. Moving it doesn't seem to help.
*   **g6g5:** This is not a legal move.
*   **e5h8, e5b8, e5g7, e5c7, e5f6, e5d6, e5f4, e5d4, e5c3, e5b2:** Bishop moves. The bishop on e4 has a lot of options. Capturing the knight on f6 with the bishop (Bxf6) looks interesting.
*   **g4g3:** Pawn move.

The most promising move appears to be **Bxf6**. This attacks the white knight and opens up the g-file for the rook.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, I have a few options. My bishop on g7 has a lot of potential diagonals. The most interesting moves seem to be the ones that attack the king or develop my pieces.

*   **g7h6** or **g7f6** look like reasonable developing moves, preparing to put pressure on the kingside.
*   **g7e5** directly attacks the king, but it's likely White will have a way to defend.
*   **g7d4** and **g7c3** are also interesting, potentially opening lines and putting pressure on the center.

I'll choose the move that immediately puts pressure on the king and forces a response.

Now I need to see my legal moves.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Okay, I have a list of legal moves. Let's analyze them.

*   **King moves:** g8h8, g8f8, g8h7, g8g7, g8f7. These are all safe squares for the king.
*   **Rook moves:** g6g7, g6h6, g6f6, g6e6, g6d6, g6c6, g6g5. Moving the rook to g7 seems like a good defensive move, protecting the g-pawn.
*   **Bishop moves:** e4h8, e4b8, e4g7, e4c7, e4f6, e4d6, e4f4, e4d4, e4c3, e4b2, e4a1. The bishop is currently attacking the white pawn on f6. Moving the bishop to f6 would be a capture, but it would also open up the g-file for the rook.
*   **Pawn moves:** g4g3. This is not a legal move.

Considering the position, I think the best move is to capture the pawn on f6 with the bishop. This opens the g-file for the rook and forces white to respond.

Alright, I've got the legal moves. The most immediate threat seems to be the rook on g7. However, I need to be careful not to blunder. Let's analyze the options.

*   **g8h8, g8f8, g8h7, g8g7, g8f7:** These are rook moves. g7 looks tempting, but it's blocked by the pawn. h8 and f8 don't seem to achieve much immediately. g7 is a check, but it can be blocked by the bishop.
*   **g6g7, g6h6, g6g5:** Pawn moves. g7 is a check, but it's blocked. g5 doesn't seem to help.
*   **f6h8, f6d8, f6g7, f6e7, f6g5, f6e5, f6h4, f6d4, f6c3, f6b2, f6a1:** Bishop moves. f6g7 is a check, but it's blocked. f6e7 seems to be a good developing move, putting pressure on the position.
*   **g4g3:** Pawn move. Doesn't seem to do much.

Considering the position, I think the best move is to develop the bishop and put pressure on the kingside.

*   **h7h8**: This is a pawn promotion. Not relevant.
*   **h7g7, h7h6, h7g6**: These are king moves. Not relevant.
*   **e7f8, e7d8, e7f6, e7d6, e7c5, e7b4, e7a3**: These are bishop moves. The bishop on e7 has a lot of potential.
*   **g5g8, g5g7, g5g6, g5h5**: These are pawn moves. Not relevant.
*   **g4g3**: This is a rook move.

The most interesting options seem to be the bishop moves. Let's consider a few:

*   **e7f6**: This attacks the white knight on f6. This looks promising.
*   **e7d6**: This controls a key square.
*   **e7c5**: This attacks the pawn on b4.

I think attacking the knight is the most active move.

Okay, I see the legal moves. I have a few options here. The pawn on f6 is under pressure. I could move the pawn on f6 to protect it. I could also move the pawn on g4. Let's consider the pawn on f6. Moving it to f5 seems like a reasonable defensive move.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Okay, I have the legal moves. I see a few options. The pawn on f5 can move to f4. The bishop on a8 has several diagonal moves. The king can move to g7 or g6.

Let's consider the pawn move f5f4. This attacks the white knight on f7. White would likely recapture with the knight, but this opens the f-file for the black rook.

Let's consider the bishop moves. The bishop on a8 could move to g2, which would be a check. However, this would leave the king exposed.

Moving the king doesn't seem like the best option right now.

I think the pawn move f5f4 is the most active and promising. It creates immediate pressure.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, I have the legal moves. Let's analyze them.

*   **h8g7, h8f6, h8e5, h8d4, h8c3, h8b2, h8a1:** These are all moves for the Black Bishop. The Bishop on h8 has a lot of potential diagonals to control.
*   **h7g7, h7g6:** These are moves for the Black King. The King is currently in a vulnerable position.
*   **f4f3:** This is a move for the Black pawn.
*   **g2g1q, g2g1r, g2g1b, g2g1n:** These are pawn promotion moves. The pawn on g2 can promote to a Queen, Rook, Bishop, or Knight.

The most pressing concern is the Black King's safety. The King is exposed. Let's see if we can improve the King's position. Moving the King to g7 seems like a reasonable first step.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, I have a good selection of moves. Let's consider the possibilities.

*   **Pawn moves:** Pushing pawns is often a good starting point. I see several options.
    *   ...f7-f6 or ...f7-f5: These are standard pawn moves, but don't seem to immediately improve my position.
    *   ...e7-e6 or ...e7-e5: These are also standard pawn moves.
    *   ...d7-d6 or ...d7-d5: These are also standard pawn moves.
    *   ...c7-c6 or ...c7-c5: These are also standard pawn moves.
    *   ...b7-b6 or ...b7-b5: These are also standard pawn moves.
    *   ...a7-a6 or ...a7-a5: These are also standard pawn moves.
    *   ...g6-g5: This pawn move seems interesting, as it attacks the white knight on f3.

*   **Knight moves:**
    *   ...h5-g7, ...h5-f6, ...h5-f4, ...h5-g3: These knight moves don't seem to be immediately helpful.
    *   ...e5-c6, ...e5-g4, ...e5-c4, ...e5-f3, ...e5-d3: These knight moves don't seem to be immediately helpful.

*   **Bishop moves:**
    *   ...f8-g7: This bishop move doesn't seem to be immediately helpful.
    *   ...c8-b7: This bishop move doesn't seem to be immediately helpful.

*   **Rook moves:**
    *   ...a8-b8: This rook move doesn't seem to be immediately helpful.
    *   ...h8-g8 or ...h8-h7: This rook move doesn't seem to be immediately helpful.

I like the idea of attacking the knight on f3 with ...g6-g5. This forces White to react, and it opens the h-file for my rook.

So, I will play g6-g5.

Alright, I have a list of legal moves. Let's analyze them.

*   **Pawn moves:** I have a lot of pawn moves available. Pushing pawns is often a good way to control the center and develop pieces.
*   **Bishop moves:** The bishop on f8 has a few options.
*   **Knight moves:** The knight on h5 has a few options.

Considering the position, I think a good developing move is to move the pawn in front of the king to control the center.

I'll move the pawn from e7 to e6.

Alright, I have a list of legal moves. Let's analyze the position. White has a strong central presence with their pawns. I need to develop my pieces and challenge their control of the center.

I see a few options. Pushing the pawn on d7 to d5 looks like a good way to challenge the center. It opens up the diagonal for my queen and bishop. I also see the option of moving the bishop on f8 to g7, which develops the bishop and prepares to put pressure on the kingside.

I think I'll go with the pawn push. It's a more direct challenge.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, I have a lot of options. Let's analyze a bit.

*   **Developing the Bishop:** `f8g7`, `f8e7`, `f8d6`, `f8c5`, `f8b4`, `f8a3` are all options. Developing the bishop is generally good. `f8g7` seems a bit passive. `f8e7` looks okay, but doesn't immediately impact the center. `f8d6` could be interesting, aiming at the center. `f8c5` is a bit more aggressive, but might be a bit exposed.
*   **King Moves:** `e8f7`, `e8e7`, `e8d7` are all options. Moving the king early is usually not a good idea.
*   **Queen Moves:** `d8e7`, `d8d7`, `d8f6`, `d8d6`, `d8g5` are options. The queen is important, but moving it too early can be dangerous. `d8e7` is a bit passive. `d8f6` could put pressure on f2.
*   **Rook Moves:** `a8b8` is a standard rook move.
*   **Knight Moves:** `h5g7`, `h5f6`, `h5f4`, `h5g3`, `e5f7`, `e5d7`, `e5g6`, `e5c6`, `e5g4`, `e5c4`, `e5f3`, `e5d3` are options. The knight on e5 is well-placed.
*   **Pawn Moves:** `h6g5`, `f5e4`, `d5e4`, `c7c6`, `b7b6`, `a7a6`, `f5f4`, `d5d4`, `c7c5`, `b7b5`, `a7a5` are options. Pawn moves can control the center or support pieces.

I'm leaning towards developing my bishop and trying to control the center. `f8d6` looks like a solid developing move, putting pressure on the center.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Okay, I have the legal moves. Let's analyze the position. Black is under some pressure, white has a strong attack. I need to find a move that improves my position and defends against the immediate threats.

The most pressing issue is the potential attack on my king. I need to consider moves that improve the king's safety.

Let's look at the pawn moves first. Moving the pawn on b7 to b6 seems like a reasonable developing move. It doesn't immediately solve any problems, but it opens up a potential escape square for the king.

Let's consider other moves. Moving the queen to a safer square could be an option.

I think the best move here is to develop the pawn on b7.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

That's a lot of moves to consider! Let's analyze a few key options.

*   **...Qe7:** This develops the queen to a more active square and potentially eyes the kingside.
*   **...h7:** This prevents a back-rank mate threat and prepares to develop the rook.
*   **...dxc4:** This opens the d-file and challenges white's control of the center.
*   **...a6 and ...b5:** These are pawn pushes that restrict white's space and can create weaknesses.

Considering the position, I think developing the queen is a good starting point. I'll play ...Qe7.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, I have a lot of options. Let's analyze the position. White's queen is a threat, and my king is a bit exposed. I need to be careful.

*   **Defensive considerations:** I need to address the threat to my king and the queen's activity.
*   **Development:** I should try to develop my pieces and control the center.
*   **Tactical opportunities:** I need to look for any immediate tactical possibilities.

Looking at the moves, I see a few that stand out:

*   **...Qd8-c7:** This move develops my queen and puts it on a more active square, defending the king and potentially eyeing the weak pawn on g7.
*   **...h8-h7:** This move prepares to develop the rook and potentially connect my rooks.
*   **...a7-a6/a7-a5:** These moves are less critical at the moment but can help control the queenside.

Considering the immediate threats and the need for development, I'll choose to develop my queen to a more active square.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

That's a lot of moves! Let's analyze the most critical ones.

*   **Defensive moves:** I need to prioritize defending my king.
    *   `h8h7`: This seems like a reasonable move to get the rook out of the back rank and potentially develop it later.
    *   `h8g8`: Moving the rook to the side to protect the king.
    *   `d7c6`: This move develops the bishop and attacks the knight.
    *   `f5e4`: This move attacks the pawn and opens the diagonal for the queen.

*   **Counterattacking moves:**
    *   `e5g6`: This move attacks the knight.
    *   `f5f4`: This move attacks the pawn and opens the diagonal for the queen.

Considering the immediate threat and the need for development, I think `h8h7` is the best move. It gets the rook out of the back rank and prepares for future development.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Okay, that's a lot of moves to consider. Let's break this down and think strategically.

*   **Threats:** White's Queen on d1 is a major threat. We need to address this.
*   **Development:** Black's pieces are somewhat passive. We need to activate them.
*   **King Safety:** Black's King is relatively safe for now, but we need to keep an eye on it.

Looking at the moves, I see a few interesting possibilities:

*   **...Qf7:** This seems like a good developing move, putting pressure on the f2 pawn and potentially eyeing an attack on the kingside. It also defends the e7 pawn.
*   **...d5d4:** This could open the position and challenge White's control of the center. However, it might also weaken the pawn structure.
*   **...c7c6:** This supports the d5 pawn and prepares to develop the knight.

Considering the threats and the need for development, I'm leaning towards **...Qf7**. It develops the Queen to an active square, defends a key pawn, and puts pressure on White.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Okay, I have the legal moves. Let's analyze them. White has a strong pawn center and a potential threat with the bishop on g7. Black needs to develop and challenge the center.

The move I like the most is to develop the knight to e7. This move attacks the center, supports the pawn on f6, and prepares for further development.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

You are absolutely correct! I made a mistake. The knight is on f6, not f7. I need to be more careful. Let's try again. The knight on f6 can move to e8, g8, d5, or h5. I still want to develop the knight, and d5 seems like a good option to challenge the center.

Okay, I'm clearly having trouble with this. Let's go back to basics. I need to make sure I'm identifying the correct piece and the correct square. The knight on f6 can move to:

*   d5
*   h5
*   g4
*   e4

I still like the idea of challenging the center. The move f6d5 attacks the pawn on e4. Let's try that again.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Okay, I have the list of legal moves. I'll consider a few options.

*   **Developing the Knight:** `g8f6` is a standard developing move, controlling central squares.
*   **Developing the Bishop:** `f8e7` or `f8d6` are also good developing moves.
*   **Pawn moves:** Pushing pawns like `h7h6` or `g7g6` can be useful for controlling space, but I want to focus on development first.

I think developing the knight to f6 is a solid and flexible move. It controls important central squares and prepares for further development.

*   **Pawn moves:** Pushing pawns like `h7h6`, `g7g6`, `d7d6`, `c7c6`, `b7b6`, `a7a6` are all possible, but don't immediately develop a piece.
*   **Pawn pushes to challenge the center:** `d7d5` and `e5e4` are interesting, but I need to be careful about leaving weaknesses.

I think `b8c6` is a solid developing move. It develops a piece, controls central squares, and prepares for further development.

*   **...f6e4** looks interesting. It attacks the center and opens up the diagonal for the bishop.
*   **...d7d5** is a standard pawn push to control the center.
*   **...e8e7** is a safe move to move the king out of the center.

I think I'll go with the pawn push to the center.

*   **Bishop moves:** The dark-squared bishop on f8 has a lot of diagonals open.
*   **Queen moves:** The queen on d8 has a lot of diagonals and files open.
*   **King moves:** The king on e8 has a few moves available.
*   **Knight moves:** The knight on c6 has a few moves available.

I think I'll start by developing my dark-squared bishop. Moving it to e7 seems like a solid developing move, controlling important squares and preparing for future action.

You are absolutely right! My apologies. I made a mistake. I was looking at the board from the wrong perspective. The pawn on e7 *cannot* move to e6 because the board is set up as:

```

p  p  p  .  b  p  p  p
.  .  n  .  .  n  .  B

My pawn is on e5, not e7. I need to re-evaluate.

Let's try ...d5d4. This challenges the center and opens the diagonal for my queen and bishop.

Okay, I see the board. Black's king is in a somewhat exposed position. White has a strong center. I need to find a good developing move that also addresses the potential threats. Let's see what moves are available.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Okay, I have a list of legal moves. Let's analyze them.

*   **h8g8, h8f8, h8e8, a8b8:** These are rook moves. Moving the rook doesn't seem to immediately improve the position.
*   **d8g8, d8f8, d8e8:** Queen moves. The Queen is well-placed.
*   **e7f8, e7d6, e7c5, e7b4, e7a3:** Bishop moves. The bishop on e7 is blocked.
*   **d7e8, d7e6, d7d6:** King moves. Moving the king is dangerous at this stage.
*   **f6g8, f6e8, f6h5, f6d5, f6g4, f6e4:** Knight moves. The knight on f6 has several options.
*   **c6b8, c6a5, c6b4:** Knight moves. The knight on c6 has several options.
*   **g7h6, g7g6:** Pawn moves. These are okay, but don't immediately help.
*   **b7b6, a7a6:** Pawn moves. These are okay, but don't immediately help.
*   **e5e4:** Pawn move. This opens the position and attacks the center.
*   **g7g5, b7b5, a7a5:** Pawn moves. These are okay, but don't immediately help.

I like the idea of developing the knight on f6 to a more active square. **Nf6-h5** looks interesting, as it attacks the white bishop on g2 and prepares to challenge the center.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, that's a lot of moves! Let's analyze.

*   **King Safety:** The king on e7 is a bit exposed. Moves like ...h6 or ...g6 could help.
*   **Development:** Developing the dark-squared bishop is a priority.
*   **Pawn Structure:** I need to be careful about weakening my pawn structure.

Considering all of this, I think developing the bishop to f8 is a good, solid move. It gets the bishop active and helps protect the king.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, I have a lot of options. White's queen and bishop are eyeing my king. I need to prioritize king safety.

*   **e7d8** looks tempting to develop the bishop, but it doesn't address the immediate threat.
*   **e7f6** is interesting. It blocks the bishop's diagonal and opens a potential escape square for the king.
*   **h7h6** and **g7g6** are passive and don't help much.
*   **f7f6** would block the bishop, but it weakens the pawn structure.
*   **e5e4** is a pawn push that doesn't seem to help.

I think **e7f6** is the best move here. It develops a piece, blocks the bishop's attack, and gives the king a potential escape route.

Okay, I have a lot of options. Let's analyze a few of the more promising ones:

*   **...h7h6:** This is a solid move, preventing a potential white knight jump to g5. It's a good prophylactic move.
*   **...g7g6:** Similar to h7h6, this supports the kingside and prepares for potential pawn advances.
*   **...f6e7:** This develops the bishop and prepares to control the long diagonal.
*   **...f6g5:** This attacks the white knight and could open up the position.
*   **...e5e4:** This is a more aggressive move, challenging white's center. However, it could leave my king exposed.

Considering the position, I think a solid developing move is best. I'll choose **...h7h6** to shore up my kingside.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, I have a list of legal moves. Let's analyze them.

*   **Pawn moves:** g7g6, b7b6, a7a6, g7g5, b7b5, a7a5, e5e4. These are standard pawn moves. Pushing g7 or b7 seems reasonable to control more space.
*   **Knight moves:** h5f4, h5g3, f6d8, f6e7, f6g5, f6h4, c6d8, c6b8, c6e7, c6a5, c6b4. The knights have a lot of options. Nf6 seems well-placed.
*   **Bishop moves:** f8g8, f8e8, f8d8, f8e7, f8d6, f8c5, f8b4, f8a3. The bishop on f8 has a long diagonal.
*   **Rook moves:** h8g8, h8h7, a8b8. The rooks are currently blocked.
*   **King moves:** d7e8, d7d8, d7e7, d7e6, d7d6. The king is relatively safe for now.
*   **Queen moves:** No queen moves.

Considering the position, I think developing the knight on f6 is a good idea. It controls important squares and prepares for further development. I'll move the knight from f6 to e7.

Alright, I have a good list of moves. Let's analyze this. White's queen is a threat, and my king is somewhat exposed. I need to be careful.

*   **h8g8, h8h7**: Moving the rook doesn't seem to address the immediate threats.
*   **f8g8, f8e8, f8d8**: Moving the bishop doesn't seem to improve the position significantly.
*   **a8b8**: Moving the rook doesn't seem to help.
*   **e7d8, e7f6, e7d6, e7g5, e7c5, e7h4, e7b4, e7a3**: These are all pawn moves. Some of them could open lines for the queen, which is not ideal.
*   **d7e8, d7d8, d7e6, d7d6**: Pawn moves.
*   **c6d8, c6b8, c6a5, c6b4**: These knight moves are interesting. c6b4 attacks the pawn on a2.
*   **h5f6, h5f4, h5g3**: These knight moves don't seem to help.
*   **g7g6, f7f6, b7b6, a7a6, e5e4, g7g5, f7f5, b7b5, a7a5**: These are all pawn moves.

I think the most active move here is to develop the knight and attack the pawn on a2. This forces White to react.

You are a professional chess player and you play as black. Now is your turn to make a move. Before making a move you can pick one of the following actions:
- 'get_current_board' to get the schema and current status of the board
- 'get_legal_moves' to get a UCI formatted list of available moves
- 'make_move <UCI formatted move>' when you are ready to complete your turn (e.g., 'make_move e2e4')

Okay, I'm ready to analyze the position and make a move. First, I need to see the current board state.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, I've got a list of legal moves. Let's analyze the position. White seems to have a strong attack brewing, especially with the queen and bishop eyeing the kingside. Black needs to be careful.

Considering the possible moves, I think I should try to consolidate my position and develop my pieces. The pawn on g7 is a bit weak. I'll move it to g6 to support it.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, that's a lot of moves. The immediate threat seems to be on the e7 square. Let's analyze the options.

*   **h8g8, h8h7, f8g8, f8e8, f8d8, f8g7, a8b8:** These are all rook and bishop moves. They don't seem to address the immediate threat to the king.
*   **e7d8, e7f6, e7d6, e7g5, e7c5, e7h4:** These are the bishop moves. e7f6 seems like a good defensive move, blocking the attack on the king.
*   **d7e8, d7d8, d7e6, d7d6, d7c6:** These are pawn moves. They don't seem to help.
*   **h5g7, h5f6, h5f4, h5g3:** These are knight moves. They don't seem to help.
*   **b4c6, b4a6, b4d5, b4d3, b4c2, b4a2:** These are knight moves. They don't seem to help.
*   **f7f6, c7c6, b7b6, a7a6, g6g5, e5e4, f7f5, c7c5, b7b5, a7a5:** These are pawn moves. They don't seem to help.
*   **d4c3:** This is a pawn move. It doesn't seem to help.

**My plan:** I think the best move here is to defend the king with the bishop.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Okay, I have a lot of options. Let's analyze them:

*   **Defensive moves:** `h8g8, h8f8, h8e8, h8d8, h8h7, a8b8, e7f8, e7d8, e7d6, e7c5, d7e8, d7d8, d7e6, d7d6, d7c6` These moves mostly involve moving the rooks or the bishop. Some of these are passive and don't address the immediate threats.
*   **Pawn moves:** `c7c6, b7b6, a7a6, g6g5, e5e4, c7c5, b7b5, a7a5` These pawn moves are mostly aimed at controlling the center or the flanks.
*   **Knight moves:** `f6g7, f6e6, f6d6, f6c6, f6b6, f6a6, f6g5, f6f5, f6h4, f6f4, f6f3, h5g7, h5f4, h5g3, b4c6, b4a6, b4d5, b4d3, b4c2, b4a2` The knight moves are numerous and offer a variety of possibilities.

Considering the position, I think I need to be proactive. White's queen is a threat, and my king is somewhat exposed. I'll try to develop a counterattack. I see a good move to develop my knight and attack the white queen.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Okay, I've got a lot of options. Let's analyze them.

*   **Rook moves:** `h8g8, h8f8, h8e8, h8d8, h8h7, a8b8` - Moving the rook doesn't seem immediately helpful.
*   **Bishop moves:** `e7f8, e7d8, e7f6, e7d6, e7g5, e7c5, e7h4` - The bishop on e7 has a lot of potential. `e7f6` looks interesting, developing the bishop and potentially putting pressure on the white knight.
*   **Pawn moves:** `d7e8, d7d8, d7e6, d7d6, d7c6, h5g7, h5f6, h5f4, h5g3, f7f6, c7c6, b7b6, a7a6, g6g5, e5e4, f7f5, c7c5, b7b5, a7a5` - Pawn moves are generally less impactful at this stage. `f7f6` seems like a reasonable developing move, supporting the king.
*   **Knight moves:** `b4c6, b4a6, b4d5, b4d3, b4c2, b4a2` - The knight on b4 has some options, but none seem particularly strong right now.

Considering the position, I think developing the bishop to f6 is a good developing move that also puts pressure on the white knight.

*   **Pawn moves:** `c7c6, b7b6, a7a6, g6g5, e5e4, c7c5, b7b5, a7a5` - Pushing pawns can help control the center and restrict white's pieces. `e5e4` is interesting, but it opens the e-file.
*   **Bishop moves:** `f6d8, f6g7, f6e7, f6g5, f6h4` - The bishop on f6 is currently blocked.
*   **King moves:** `d7e8, d7d8, d7e6, d7c6` - The king is currently safe.
*   **Pawn moves:** `h5g7, h5f4, h5g3` - These moves don't seem to help the position.

Considering the position, I think I should try to develop my pieces and control the center. `c7c6` seems like a solid developing move, supporting the pawn on d7 and preparing to develop my bishop.

You are a professional chess player and you play as black. Now is your turn to make a move. Before making a move you can pick one of the following actions:
- 'get_current_board' to get the schema and current status of the board
- 'get_legal_moves' to get a UCI formatted list of available moves
- 'make_move <UCI formatted move>' when you are ready to complete your turn (e.g., 'make_move e2e4')

Okay, I see the board. Black's king is in a precarious position. White has a strong attack developing. I need to find a move that addresses the immediate threats and improves my position. Let's get the legal moves.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, I've got the list of legal moves. White is clearly trying to attack the king. Let's analyze the moves.

*   **Rook moves (h8g8, h8f8, h8e8, h8d8, h8h7, a8b8):** These moves don't seem to immediately address the threat and don't improve the position significantly.
*   **Pawn moves (b7b6, a7a6, g6g5, c6c5, b7b5, a7a5):** These pawn moves are mostly passive and don't help defend the king.
*   **Bishop moves (f6d8, f6g7, f6e7, f6g5, f6h4):** The bishop on f6 is a key defender. Moving it to d8 or g7 doesn't seem to help. e7 is a possibility, but it blocks the pawn. g5 or h4 are interesting, but don't seem to be the best.
*   **Pawn moves (e5e4):** This opens the position and could be dangerous.
*   **King moves (d7e8, d7d8, d7e7, d7c7, d7e6, d7d6):** The king is under attack. Moving the king is the most important thing to do. d7e8, d7d8, d7e7, d7c7, d7e6, d7d6 are all possible.
*   **Pawn moves (h5g7, h5f4, h5g3):** These moves are not good.

The most important thing is to move the king to safety. The best move seems to be **Kd7e7**. This gets the king out of the immediate line of fire and potentially opens up escape routes.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Okay, I have a lot of options. Let's consider them.

*   **Developing the Bishop:** `c8d7`, `c8e6`, `c8f5`, `c8g4` are all options. `c8d7` is a bit passive. `c8e6` looks interesting, developing the bishop to a good square and potentially eyeing the weak f7 pawn. `c8f5` could be good too, putting pressure on the center. `c8g4` is less appealing as it could be attacked by a pawn.
*   **Moving the Rook:** `a8b8`, `h8g8`, `h8f8`, `h8e8`, `h8d8`, `h8h7` are all options. Moving the rook doesn't seem urgent right now.
*   **Pawn Moves:** `b7b6`, `a7a6`, `g6g5`, `c6c5`, `e5e4`, `b7b5`, `a7a5` are all possible pawn moves. `b7b6` and `a7a6` are solid, but don't immediately improve my position. `g6g5` could weaken my kingside. `c6c5` challenges the center. `e5e4` is a pawn push that could open the position, but it might be premature. `b7b5` and `a7a5` are also possible pawn pushes.
*   **Other Moves:** `f6g7`, `f6g5`, `f6h4`, `h5g7`, `h5f4`, `h5g3`, `e7f8`, `e7e8`, `e7d8`, `e7d7`, `e7e6`, `e7d6` are all knight moves.

I like the idea of developing the bishop to `e6` or `f5`, and challenging the center with `c6c5`. I think I'll start with developing the bishop. I'll choose `c8e6`.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, I have a lot of options. Let's analyze some of the more interesting ones:

*   **...h8h7:** This is a standard rook move to protect the back rank. It's solid, but doesn't immediately improve my position.
*   **...a8a6 or ...a8a5:** These pawn moves are also relatively passive.
*   **...e7d6 or ...e7d7:** These moves with the pawn in front of the king look like they might help protect the king, but they also weaken the pawn structure.
*   **...f6g5:** This attacks the bishop on f4, which could be good.
*   **...g6g5:** This pawn move challenges white's central control.
*   **...c6c5:** This pawn move also challenges white's central control.
*   **...b7b6 or ...b7b5:** These pawn moves are also relatively passive.
*   **...e5e4:** This pawn move opens the position and could lead to tactical complications.

I think I like the idea of challenging white's central control and potentially opening the position. Between g6g5 and c6c5, I prefer **...g6g5**. It directly attacks the center and prepares to challenge white's control.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, I have a lot of options. Let's break this down.

*   **Rook moves:** The rook on a8 has a lot of potential moves, but moving it now doesn't seem to immediately improve my position. The rook on h8 has similar options.
*   **Pawn moves:** I have several pawn moves available. Pushing the b-pawn (b7b6 or b7b5) could challenge white's control of the center. Pushing the a-pawn (a7a6 or a7a5) is less critical. The c-pawn (c6c5) could also challenge the center. The e-pawn (e5e4) looks interesting, potentially opening lines for my pieces and attacking the pawn on d4.
*   **Bishop moves:** The bishop on f6 has several possible moves, but none of them seem particularly strong at the moment.
*   **King moves:** The king has no immediate safe moves.

Considering the position, I think the most promising move is to challenge white's center with the e-pawn. This opens lines for my pieces and forces white to react.

Okay, I have a lot of options. Let's think this through.

*   **Rook moves:** The rook on h8 has a lot of options, but moving it doesn't seem immediately impactful. The rook on a8 also has a lot of options, but similar to the other rook, it doesn't seem to be the best move right now.
*   **Pawn moves:** Pushing the pawns on b7, a7, h6, and c6 are all possible. Pushing b7 to b6 or b5 looks reasonable, controlling more of the center. Pushing a7 to a6 or a5 is also an option. Pushing h6 to h5 doesn't seem to do much. Pushing c6 to c5 is a possibility, but it might open the position too much.
*   **King moves:** The king on e7 has a few options, but moving the king now seems premature.
*   **Bishop moves:** The bishop on f6 has a few moves, but none of them seem particularly strong.
*   **Pawn on e4:** The pawn on e4 has a few moves, but none of them seem particularly strong.

Considering the position, I think pushing the b-pawn is a good idea. It challenges the center and prepares for further development. I'll choose b7b6.

*   **Defensive moves:** Moving the rook on h8 is a priority.
*   **Counterplay:** Trying to develop pieces and create threats.

After careful consideration, I'll move the rook on h8 to h7 to defend against a potential checkmate.

You are a professional chess player and you play as black. Now is your turn to make a move. Before making a move you can pick one of the following actions:
- 'get_current_board' to get the schema and current status of the board
- 'get_legal_moves' to get a UCI formatted list of available moves
- 'make_move <UCI formatted move>' when you are ready to complete your turn (e.g., 'make_move e2e4')

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, I've got a lot of options. The immediate threat is the rook on h1. I need to address that. Moving the rook on a8 to h8 seems like the best defensive move. It blocks the check and develops the rook.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, I have the legal moves. Let's analyze them.

*   **Rook moves (h8):** The rook on h8 has many options, but none immediately seem particularly strong. Moving it to g8, f8, e8, d8, c8, b8, or a8 doesn't immediately improve the position.
*   **Pawn moves (h7, e7, f6, b6, e4, a7, c6):**
    *   h7g7 doesn't seem to help.
    *   e7 can move to e8, d8, d7, d6. e7d6 looks interesting, opening the diagonal for the bishop.
    *   f6g7, f6e5. f6e5 attacks the pawn on d4.
    *   b6a5, b6b5. b6b5 seems like a standard pawn move.
    *   e4f3, e4d3, e4e3. These are pawn moves that don't seem to help.
    *   a7a6, c6c5. a7a6 and c6c5 are standard pawn moves.
*   **Bishop moves (e6):** e6c8, e6d7, e6f5, e6d5, e6g4, e6c4. e6f5 attacks the pawn on d4. e6d5 seems like a good move.
*   **King moves (e7):** e7f8, e7e8, e7d8, e7d7, e7d6. e7d6 looks interesting, opening the diagonal for the bishop.

Considering the options, I think the best move is to develop the bishop and put pressure on the center. I will move the bishop from e6 to d5.

Alright, I've got the legal moves. Let's analyze them. The most pressing issue seems to be the exposed king. I need to develop a plan to either defend it or create counterplay.

*   **h8g8, h8f8, h8e8, h8d8, h8c8, h8b8, h8a8:** Moving the rook doesn't seem immediately helpful.
*   **h7g7:** Moving the pawn doesn't help the king's safety.
*   **e7f8, e7e8, e7d8:** Moving the pawn to promote is not possible.
*   **e7d7, e7e6, e7d6:** These pawn moves don't seem to improve the position.
*   **f6g7, f6e5:** Moving the pawn doesn't help.
*   **d5e6, d5c4:** These pawn moves don't seem to improve the position.
*   **b6a5, b6b5:** These pawn moves don't seem to improve the position.

*   **h7g7:** Moving the pawn on h7. This is a standard pawn move.
*   **f6d8, f6g7, f6e7, f6e5:** Moving the bishop on f6. The bishop on f6 is currently blocked.
*   **e6e7, e6d7, e6d6, e6e5:** Moving the pawn on e6. This pawn is protecting the king.
*   **d5c4:** Moving the pawn on d5. This pawn is currently blocked.
*   **b6a5:** Moving the pawn on b6. This pawn is currently blocked.
*   **e4f3, e4d3:** Moving the pawn on e4. This pawn is currently blocked.

*   **b6b5:** Moving the pawn on b6. This is a standard pawn move.

Alright, I have a list of legal moves. Let's analyze them.

*   **Rook moves (h8):** The rook on h8 has many options, but moving it now doesn't seem to achieve much.
*   **Pawn moves (h7, f6, e5, d5, e4, a7, h6, c6, b6):** I have a lot of pawn moves available.
    *   `h7g7` doesn't seem to help.
    *   `f6d8`, `f6g7`, `f6e7` are all possible, but don't seem to improve my position significantly.
    *   `e5e6` and `e5d6` look interesting, potentially challenging the center.
    *   `e5f4` is a bit risky, opening the diagonal for the white bishop.
    *   `d5e6` and `d5c4` are also possible, but don't seem as strong.
    *   `e4f3` and `e4d3` are not good moves.
    *   `a7a6` or `a7a5` are standard pawn moves.
    *   `h6h5` is a standard pawn move.
    *   `c6c5` and `b6b5` are standard pawn moves.
    *   `e4e3` is not a good move.
*   **Bishop moves (f6):** The bishop on f6 has a few options, but none seem immediately impactful.

Considering the position, I think the most active move is to challenge the center. I'll play `e5e6`.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Okay, I've reviewed the legal moves. The position is complex. White has a strong attack on the kingside, and I need to be careful. I see a few options:

*   **...h7g7**: This move defends the h-file and prepares to potentially develop the rook.
*   **...f6e5**: This challenges white's control of the center and opens lines for the bishop.
*   **...e6e5**: This also challenges the center and opens lines for the bishop.
*   **...d5c4**: This attacks the bishop and could open the position.

I think ...f6e5 is the most active move. It immediately challenges white's control of the center and opens lines for my bishop.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, I have the legal moves. Let's analyze them.

*   **Rook moves (h8):** The rook on h8 has many options, but none seem immediately impactful.
*   **Pawn moves (e6, h7, d5, b6, f7, a7, h6, c6):**
    *   `e6e7` and `e6d7` are not good as they block the king.
    *   `e6f6` and `e6d6` are also not good as they block the king.
    *   `h7g7` is a passive move.
    *   `d5c4` is interesting, attacking the pawn on c4.
    *   `b6a5` and `b6b5` are standard pawn moves.
    *   `f7f6` and `f7f5` are standard pawn moves.
    *   `a7a6` is a standard pawn move.
    *   `h6h5` is a standard pawn move.
    *   `c6c5` is a standard pawn move.
*   **Bishop moves (e5):** The bishop on e5 has a lot of potential, but the moves are not immediately threatening.
*   **Pawn moves (e4):** `e4f3`, `e4d3`, `e4e3` are not good as they block the king.

The most active move seems to be `d5c4`, attacking the pawn on c4 and opening the diagonal for the bishop. This forces White to react.

Therefore, I will play `d5c4`.

Alright, I have the list of legal moves. The position is complex, and there are many possibilities. Let's analyze a few key areas:

*   **King Safety:** My king is somewhat exposed. White's rooks and queen pose a threat.
*   **Piece Activity:** My pieces are not very active. I need to improve their positioning.
*   **Pawn Structure:** The pawn structure is quite locked.

Considering these factors, I'll focus on developing a piece and improving my king's safety. The move `h8g8` seems like a reasonable developing move, bringing the rook to a more active position.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, that's a lot of moves! Let's analyze the position and narrow down the possibilities. White's king is vulnerable, so I want to exploit that.

*   **Immediate Threats:** The rook on h8 is a potential threat to the king.

*   **Possible Plans:** I could try to attack the king directly, or I could try to improve the position of my pieces.

Considering the available moves, I think the best move is to move the rook on h8 to g8 to put pressure on the g-file and potentially threaten a checkmate.

Alright, I've got the legal moves. White is threatening checkmate. I need to find the best defensive move.

*   **h7h8=Q/R/B/N:** Promoting the pawn on h7 is tempting, but it doesn't immediately solve the problems.
*   **g7g8=Q/R/B/N:** Same as above.
*   **g7g6:** This doesn't help much.
*   **e6e7:** This blocks the diagonal of the white queen.
*   **e6d7:** This doesn't help.
*   **e6f6:** This doesn't help.
*   **e6d6:** This doesn't help.
*   **e5b8:** This is a bad move.
*   **e5c7:** This doesn't help.
*   **e5f6:** This doesn't help.
*   **e5d6:** This doesn't help.
*   **e5f4:** This doesn't help.
*   **e5g3:** This doesn't help.
*   **e5h2:** This doesn't help.
*   **c4d5:** This doesn't help.
*   **c4b5:** This doesn't help.
*   **c4d3:** This doesn't help.
*   **c4b3:** This doesn't help.
*   **c6b5:** This doesn't help.
*   **e4f3:** This doesn't help.

*   **e4e3:** This doesn't help.
*   **f7f5:** This doesn't help.
*   **a7a5:** This doesn't help.

After careful consideration, I believe **e6e7** is the best move. It blocks the white queen's diagonal and prevents immediate checkmate.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, I've got a list of legal moves. White's queen is a major threat, and the rooks are also well-placed. I need to prioritize defending the king and developing my pieces.

*   **h7h8** and **g7g8** are pawn promotions.
*   **e7f8, e7e8, e7d8** are pawn promotions.
*   **e7d7, e7f6, e7e6, e7d6** are pawn moves.
*   **e5b8, e5c7, e5f6, e5d6, e5f4** are bishop moves.
*   **c4e6, c4d5, c4b5, c4d3, c4b3** are queen moves.
*   **c6b5** is a pawn move.
*   **g5f4** is a pawn move.
*   **e4f3, e4d3** are pawn moves.
*   **f7f6, a7a6, h6h5, c6c5, e4e3, f7f5, a7a5** are pawn moves.

The most pressing issue is the threat to the king. I need to find a move that addresses this. Moving the pawn on e7 seems like a good option. **e7e6** blocks the queen's attack and opens a line for the bishop.

h7h8,g7g8,g7g6,e6e7,e6d7,e6f6,e6d6,e5b8,e5c7,e5f6,e5d6,e5f4,c4d5,c4b5,c4d3,c4b3,c4a2,c6b5,g5f4,e4f3,e4d3,f7f6,a7a6,h6h5,c6c5,e4e3,f7f5,a7a5

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, I've got a list of legal moves. The most pressing issue is the attack on the king. I need to find a move that addresses this.

*   **h7h8, g7g8:** These are pawn promotions. Not immediately relevant to the defense.
*   **g7g6, e6e7, e6d7, e6f6, e6d6:** These are pawn moves. Some might be useful for defense.
*   **e5b8, e5c7, e5f6, e5d6, e5f4, c4d5, c4b5, c4d3, c4b3, c4a2:** These are queen moves. The queen is well-placed, but I need to be careful not to leave it exposed.
*   **c6b5:** This pawn move doesn't seem to help much.
*   **g5f4:** This pawn move doesn't seem to help much.
*   **e4f3, e4d3:** These are bishop moves. These could be useful.
*   **f7f6, a7a6, h6h5, c6c5, e4e3, f7f5, a7a5:** These are pawn moves.

Looking at the position, I think the most important thing is to defend the king. The move **e6d6** looks like a good defensive move. It blocks the diagonal of the white queen and potentially opens up a line for my queen to defend.

Okay, I see the board. Black's king is in a precarious position. White has a strong attack developing. I need to find a move that addresses the immediate threats and improves my position. Let's get a list of legal moves.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Proxy (to Player_Black):

h7h8,g7g8,g7g6,e7f8,e7e8,e7d8,e7d7,e7e6,c4e6,c4d5,c4b5,c4d3,c4b3,c4a2,c6b5,g5f4,e4d3,f7f6,a7a6,h6h5,c6c5,e4e3,f7f5,a7a5

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, I've got the legal moves. The most pressing issue is the attack on the h-file. White's rooks are bearing down. I need to address this immediately.

*   **h7h8=Q, h7h8=R, h7h8=B, h7h8=N:** Promoting the pawn on h7 to a queen, rook, bishop, or knight. Promoting to a queen is the most powerful option, but it doesn't immediately solve the threat. Promoting to a rook or bishop would also be insufficient. Promoting to a knight might offer some tactical possibilities, but it's not the best choice here.
*   **g7g6:** This move doesn't help much.
*   **e7f8, e7e8, e7d8, e7d7, e7e6:** Moving the pawn on e7. These moves don't address the immediate threat on the h-file.
*   **c4e6, c4d5, c4b5, c4d3, c4b3, c4a2:** Moving the queen. These moves don't address the immediate threat on the h-file.
*   **c6b5:** Moving the pawn on c6. This move doesn't address the immediate threat on the h-file.
*   **g5f4:** Moving the pawn on g5. This move doesn't address the immediate threat on the h-file.
*   **e4d3:** Moving the pawn on e4. This move doesn't address the immediate threat on the h-file.
*   **f7f6, a7a6, h6h5, c6c5, e4e3, f7f5, a7a5:** These pawn moves don't address the immediate threat on the h-file.

The only move that seems to offer any immediate defense is promoting the pawn on h7 to a queen. This creates a queen on h8 and blocks the rook on h1.

Therefore, I will promote the pawn to a queen.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, I've got the legal moves. White is clearly trying to exploit the open h-file and the exposed king. I need to find a way to defend and ideally create some counterplay.

Let's analyze a few options:

*   **h8h7:** This seems like a natural defensive move, trying to block the rook on h8.
*   **g7g6:** This weakens the kingside pawn structure, but might be necessary to create some space.
*   **c6b5:** This attacks the queen and could force a trade or repositioning.
*   **e7e6:** This blocks the diagonal of the white bishop on f1 and supports the defense of the king.

Considering the position, I think the most important thing is to defend the king and try to develop some counterplay. I'll choose **h8h7** to block the rook and prepare for further defense.

*   **h7h8, g7g8, e7f8, e7e8, e7d8:** These are pawn promotions. Promoting to a queen is tempting, but doesn't immediately solve the threat. Promoting to a rook would block the check.
*   **g7g6:** This pawn move doesn't help.
*   **e7d7, e7e6:** These pawn moves don't help.
*   **c4e6, c4d5, c4b5, c4d3, c4b3, c4a2:** These are queen moves. The queen is currently pinned.
*   **c6b5:** This is a pawn move.
*   **g5f4:** This is a pawn move.
*   **e4d3:** This is a pawn move.
*   **f7f6, a7a6, h6h5, c6c5, e4e3, f7f5, a7a5:** These are pawn moves.

Promoting to a rook seems like the best option to block the check.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Okay, I'm still making illegal moves. I need to be more careful. Let's re-examine the board and the legal moves. The key is to block the check from the rook on h7.

The rook on h7 is attacking the king. The only way to block the check is to promote the pawn on h7. I can promote to a queen, rook, bishop, or knight. Promoting to a queen or rook seems like the most logical choices.

Let's try promoting to a queen again. I must have made a typo before.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, I have a good list of moves. Let's consider a few options.

*   **Developing the knight:** ...Nf6 is a standard developing move, controlling central squares.
*   **Developing the bishop:** ...Be7 is also a good developing move, preparing to control the long diagonal.
*   **Pawn moves:** ...h6, ...g6, ...f6, ...d6, ...c6, ...b6, ...a6 are all possible, but a bit passive at this stage.
*   **Pawn pushes:** ...h5, ...g5, ...f5, ...d5, ...c5, ...b5, ...a5 could be interesting later, but are premature now.

I think developing the knight is the most solid and flexible option.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, I have a list of legal moves. Let's analyze them.

The most common opening move for black in this position is to develop a piece. The move ...h6 looks passive. ...g6 is also a bit passive. ...d6 is a solid developing move, but doesn't immediately challenge white. ...e7 is also a standard developing move.

...f6 is a developing move for the knight, but it blocks the f-pawn. ...c6 is also a developing move for the knight.

...h5 and ...g5 are pawn pushes that can be useful later, but they are premature at this stage.

I think the best move here is to develop the queen's bishop.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, I have a good list of moves. Let's analyze them.

*   **Pawn moves:** Pushing pawns is generally good in the opening to control the center and develop pieces. `h7h6`, `g7g6`, `e7e6`, `d7d6`, `b7b6`, `a7a6` are all solid, but a bit passive. `h7h5`, `g7g5`, `e7e5`, `d7d5`, `b7b5`, `a7a5` are more aggressive, but could leave some weaknesses.
*   **Knight moves:** `c6b8`, `c6e5`, `c6a5`, `c6d4`, `c6b4` are all possibilities. `c6e5` looks interesting, attacking the center. `f6g8`, `f6h5`, `f6d5`, `f6g4`, `f6e4` are also options. `f6e4` is a bit aggressive, but might be interesting.
*   **Rook moves:** `a8b8` and `h8g8` are available, but not very active at this stage.
*   **Bishop moves:** No bishop moves are available at this stage.
*   **Queen moves:** No queen moves are available at this stage.
*   **King moves:** No king moves are available at this stage.

Considering the position, I think developing a knight to the center is a good idea. `c6e5` looks like a strong move, challenging the center and potentially opening lines for my pieces.

Alright, I have the list of legal moves. Let's analyze the position. White has developed their knight to c3 and e5, putting pressure on the center. Black needs to develop and control the center as well.

I see a few options. Moving the bishop on f6 seems like a good idea to develop it. I could move it to g4, attacking the knight on e5, or to h5 to put pressure on the kingside. I could also move the pawn to e6 to control the center.

I think I'll develop the bishop to g4, attacking the knight on e5. This forces white to react and opens up the diagonal for my queen.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, I've got a list of legal moves. Let's analyze the position. White has developed their queen early, and I need to be careful. I see a few options.

*   **Developing a piece:** Moves like ...Nf6-h5 or ...Nf6-g4 look tempting to develop my knight, but they might be a bit passive.
*   **Pawn moves:** Pushing a pawn like ...h7-h6 or ...g7-g6 is solid, but doesn't immediately challenge white.
*   **Central control:** ...e7-e6 or ...d7-d6 are good for controlling the center, but they might be a bit slow.

Considering the early queen development, I think the best approach is to develop my knight and challenge the center. **...Nf6-d5** looks like a good developing move, putting pressure on the center and potentially opening lines for my queen and bishop.

Alright, I've got a lot of options. Let's analyze this. White's queen is a threat, and I need to develop my pieces and defend against potential attacks.

*   **Pawn moves:** Pushing pawns like h7h6, g7g6, etc., are standard, but don't immediately address the threats.
*   **Bishop moves:** ...Bf6 looks interesting, developing a piece and potentially eyeing the kingside. ...Be7 is also a developing move.
*   **Queen moves:** The queen moves are more defensive.
*   **Other moves:** I don't see any immediate tactical opportunities.

I think developing the bishop is a good idea. ...Bf6 seems like a solid developing move, putting pressure on the kingside.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Okay, I've reviewed the legal moves. White's queen on f7 is a threat. I need to consider how to defend against it and develop my pieces.

*   **...f6e7** This move defends the f7 square and develops the bishop. It seems like a solid defensive move.
*   **...h7h6** and **...h7h5** are passive moves and don't address the immediate threat.
*   **...g7g6** is also a passive move.
*   **...c7c6** and **...c7c5** are possible pawn moves, but don't seem to improve my position significantly right now.
*   **...b7b6** and **...b7b5** are also pawn moves, but don't seem to be the best options.
*   **...a7a6** and **...a7a5** are also pawn moves, but don't seem to be the best options.
*   **...e8d8, e8e7, e8d7** are king moves. Moving the king is not a priority right now.
*   **...a8b8** is a rook move.
*   **...f6d8, f6h6, f6g6, f6g5, f6f5, f6f4** are bishop moves.
*   **...e5d7, e5g6, e5c6, e5g4, e5c4, e5f3, e5d3** are queen moves.
*   **...d5e7, d5b6, d5f4, d5b4, d5e3, d5c3** are pawn moves.

I think **...f6e7** is the best move here. It defends the f7 square and develops the bishop.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Okay, I have a lot of options. Let's analyze a few of the more interesting ones:

*   **...h7h6:** This is a standard pawn move, preventing a potential White knight jump to g5. It's solid, but doesn't really develop anything.
*   **...g7g6:** Similar to h7h6, it supports the kingside.
*   **...f7f6:** This can help support the e5 pawn and prepare for ...e5-e4.
*   **...c7c6:** This supports the d5 pawn and prepares to develop the light-squared bishop.
*   **...b7b6:** This is a bit passive.
*   **...a7a6:** This is also passive.
*   **...e7d7:** This opens the diagonal for the queen.
*   **...e7f6:** This opens the diagonal for the queen and supports the e5 pawn.
*   **...d5f6:** This is a knight move that attacks the queen.
*   **...d5b6:** This is a knight move that attacks the queen.
*   **...c8d7:** This develops the bishop.

Considering the position, I think developing the light-squared bishop is a good idea. It can help control the center and put pressure on White's position. I also like the idea of supporting the e5 pawn. I will choose to develop the bishop and support the pawn.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, I have a lot of options. White's queen on f7 is a threat, and I need to address it. I see several possibilities:

*   **Defensive moves:** Moving the king (e8d8, e8c8) is tempting, but it might further restrict the king. Moving the bishop (e7f6, e7g5) could help control the diagonal, but it might also be too passive.
*   **Counterplay:** Developing pieces like the pawn to h6, g6, f6, c6, b6, a6, h5, f5, c5.
*   **Tactical possibilities:** There are no immediate tactical opportunities.

Considering the position, I think the most important thing is to try and develop my pieces and control the center. I think I will push the pawn on f7 to f6 to block the queen's attack and prepare for further development.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Okay, I have the list of legal moves. Let's analyze the position and the available moves.

White has a strong pawn center and is putting pressure on the black position. Black needs to develop pieces and find a way to counterattack.

Here's my thinking:

*   **Pawn Structure:** White's pawn structure is solid. Black needs to try to undermine it.
*   **Piece Development:** Black's pieces are somewhat passive. The Bishop on f8 is blocked.
*   **King Safety:** Black's King is relatively safe for now.
*   **Tactical Considerations:** There don't appear to be any immediate tactical threats.

Considering the available moves, I think the best move is to develop the Bishop on f8 and put some pressure on the center.

Therefore, I will move the Bishop on f8 to g7.

Okay, I've got the list of legal moves. Let's analyze them.

*   **Pawn moves:** I see a lot of pawn moves. Pushing the pawns in front of my pieces is a good start.
*   **Knight moves:** I have knight moves to develop my knights.
*   **Queen moves:** I have queen moves, but I don't want to move my queen out too early.
*   **King moves:** I don't have any king moves.
*   **Rook moves:** I don't have any rook moves.
*   **Bishop moves:** I have bishop moves.

I think I'll start by developing a knight. `g8f6` looks like a solid developing move.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, I have a good number of options. Let's consider the position. White has developed their pieces, and I need to respond in kind. The pawn structure is relatively closed at the moment. I see a few reasonable plans:

*   **Develop the Queen's Bishop:** Moves like ...Bg4 or ...Bf5 aim to develop the bishop and put pressure on white's kingside.
*   **Develop the Knight:** Moves like ...Nc6 or ...Nd7 are standard developing moves.
*   **Pawn moves:** ...h6, ...g6, ...e6, ...c6 are all solid moves to control the center and prepare for further development.

I like the idea of developing the Queen's Bishop to put some pressure on White's kingside. ...Bg4 looks interesting, attacking the knight on f3.

Therefore, I will play ...Bg4.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, I've got a list of legal moves. Let's analyze them. The position looks relatively open. White has a queen out early, so I need to be careful. I see a few options:

*   **Developing moves:** `h8g8` (moving the rook) and `b8d7`, `b8c6`, `b8a6` (developing the knight) are all reasonable developing moves.
*   **Pawn moves:** `h7h6`, `g7g6`, `e7e6`, `c7c6`, `b7b6`, `a7a6`, `h7h5`, `g7g5`, `e7e5`, `c7c5`, `b7b5`, `a7a5` are all standard pawn moves. Some of these control the center, and some prepare for future development.
*   **Queen moves:** `e8d7`, `d8c8`, `d8d7`, `d8d6` are queen moves.
*   **Knight moves:** `f6g8`, `f6d7`, `f6h5`, `f6e4` are knight moves.
*   **Bishop moves:** `g4c8`, `g4d7`, `g4e6`, `g4h5`, `g4f5`, `g4h3`, `g4f3` are bishop moves.

I think I'll focus on developing a piece and controlling the center. The knight on b8 seems like a good piece to develop. I'll move it to c6.

Okay, I have a lot of options. Let's analyze a few.

*   **...h7h6** and **...g7g6**: These are standard pawn moves to protect the king. They are solid but don't develop any pieces or challenge white's center immediately.
*   **...e7e6**: This supports the d5 pawn and prepares to develop the dark-squared bishop. This looks like a good developing move.
*   **...d5d4**: This challenges white's pawn structure in the center. However, it opens the diagonal for white's queen.
*   **...f6e4**: This is a knight fork, attacking the queen and the pawn on c3. This is a tempting tactical move.
*   **...d8d7**: This develops the queen, but it doesn't seem to have an immediate impact.

Considering the position, I think developing my pieces and challenging the center is the best approach. **...e7e6** looks like a solid developing move that prepares for further development.

Okay, I have a lot of options. White seems to be preparing an attack on the kingside. I need to develop my pieces to defend and potentially counterattack.

*   **...h7-h6:** This seems like a solid, prophylactic move to prevent a potential kingside attack. It also opens up the possibility of developing the rook on h8 later.
*   **...g7-g6:** Similar to h7-h6, this supports the kingside and prepares for a possible ...Bg7.
*   **...f8-e7:** This develops the bishop and prepares to defend the kingside.
*   **...e8-e7:** This moves the king to a safer position.

Considering the position, I think developing the bishop to e7 is a good move. It defends the kingside and prepares for further development.

Okay, I see the board. Black's king is in a somewhat exposed position. White has a strong presence in the center. I need to develop my pieces and try to create some counterplay. Let's see what legal moves I have.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Okay, I have a lot of options. Let's analyze a few of them:

*   **...h7h6**: This seems like a solid, passive move, preventing a potential white pawn push to h5.
*   **...g7g6**: Similar to h7h6, it supports the kingside and prevents a white pawn advance.
*   **...e7e5**: This challenges white's control of the center and opens lines for the queen and bishop. This looks interesting.
*   **...d7d6**: This is a more conservative move, supporting the pawn structure.
*   **...f6e4**: This attacks the knight and opens the diagonal for the bishop.

I think I like the idea of challenging the center with **...e7e5**. It's a dynamic move that forces white to react.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, I've got a lot of options. Let's think this through. White's king is exposed, but they have a strong pawn structure. I need to develop my pieces and put pressure on the king.

*   **h8g8, h8f8, h8e8, a8c8, a8b8, d8g8, d8f8, d8e8, d8c8, d8b8**: Moving the rooks or queen doesn't seem immediately helpful.
*   **e7f8, e7d6, e7c5, e7b4, e7a3**: The bishop on e7 has some interesting diagonals, but I don't see an immediate threat.
*   **d7e8, d7c8, d7e6, d7d6**: Moving the pawn on d7 is not a good idea.
*   **f6g8, f6e8, f6h5, f6e4**: The knight on f6 is a good piece. Moving it to e4 looks interesting, attacking the pawn on d2 and opening up lines.
*   **c6b8, c6a5, c6d4, c6b4**: The knight on c6 has some options but none seem particularly strong right now.
*   **g4e6, g4h5, g4f5, g4h3, g4f3**: The bishop on g4 is not a good piece.
*   **d5e4**: This is a good move, attacking the pawn on d2 and opening up lines.
*   **h7h6, g7g6, b7b6, a7a6, d5d4, h7h5, g7g5, b7b5**: These pawn moves are not a good idea.

I think the best move here is to develop the knight on f6 to e4. It attacks a pawn, opens lines, and puts pressure on the center.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Okay, I have a lot of options. The most pressing issue is the threat to the king. White's queen and knight are well-positioned to attack. Let's analyze the moves:

*   **King moves:** Moving the king is tempting, but the available squares don't really improve the situation.
*   **Queen moves:** The queen is under attack. Moving the queen is a priority.
*   **Rook moves:** The rooks are not immediately involved in the defense.
*   **Bishop moves:** The bishop on f8 is blocked. The bishop on c8 is not immediately helpful.
*   **Knight moves:** The knight on c6 is a good defender.
*   **Pawn moves:** Pawn moves are generally not the best way to defend against a direct attack.

The most important thing is to defend the king. The queen is under attack and needs to move.

Let's consider the queen moves. The best move is to move the queen to a safe square.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Okay, that's a lot of moves. Let's analyze a bit. White's queen on c3 is a threat. I need to consider how to develop my pieces and defend my king.

*   **Queen moves:** Moving the queen doesn't seem immediately helpful, as it doesn't directly address the immediate threats.
*   **Bishop moves:** The bishop on f8 has a few options, but none seem particularly strong right now. The bishop on e7 has more options, but again, nothing jumps out as a clear improvement.
*   **Pawn moves:** Pushing pawns can open lines, but I need to be careful not to weaken my king's position.
*   **Knight moves:** The knight on g4 has some interesting possibilities.

Let's consider the knight on g4. Moving it to e6 (g4e6) attacks the white knight and opens a line for the bishop on f8. This seems like a reasonable developing move that also challenges white's pieces.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

That's a lot of options. Let's analyze them.

*   **King moves:** `h8g8` is the only legal king move. It doesn't seem to improve the king's safety significantly.
*   **Rook moves:** `a8e8, a8d8, a8c8, a8b8` seem passive. `f8g8, f8e8, f8d8, f8c8, f8b8` are also passive.
*   **Bishop moves:** `e7d8, e7f6, e7d6, e7g5, e7c5, e7b4, e7a3` are all options. `e7f6` looks interesting, developing the bishop and potentially eyeing the weak f2 square.
*   **Knight moves:** `c6d8, c6b8, c6a5, c6d4, c6b4` seem to be developing moves. `e4f6, e4d6, e4g5, e4c5, e4g3, e4c3, e4f2, e4d2` are also options. `e4f6` is a good developing move.
*   **Pawn moves:** `h7h6, g7g6, f7f6, b7a6, d7e8, d7d8, d7c8, d7d6, e6f5, e6g4, e6h3, b7b6, d5c4, h7h5, f7f5, b7b5` are all pawn moves. `h7h6, g7g6, f7f6, b7b6, d5d4` are all passive. `h7h5, f7f5, b7b5` are more aggressive.

Considering the position, I think developing the knight and bishop is a good plan. I'll play `Nf6` to develop the knight and challenge white's control of the center.

*   **Pawn moves:** Pawn moves like h7h6, g7g6, b7b6, h7h5, b7b5, e5e4, d5d4 are not immediately helpful.
*   **Knight moves:** The knight moves (c6d8, c6b8, c6a5, c6d4, c6b4) are not immediately helpful.

The most pressing issue is the threat to the king. I need to find a move that improves the king's safety. The move **h7h6** seems like a good defensive move, preventing a potential checkmate threat.

Okay, I have a lot of options. Let's analyze a bit.

*   **Defensive Considerations:** White's queen on c3 is a threat. I need to consider how to defend against potential attacks.
*   **Development:** I need to develop my pieces to improve my position.
*   **King Safety:** My king is somewhat vulnerable.

Considering all of this, I think the best move here is to develop my queen's bishop to a more active square.

I will move my bishop from f8 to g8.

*   **...Kd6** looks like a good option to move the king out of the way.

Let's go with **Kd6**.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Okay, that's a lot of moves. Let's analyze the most critical ones. White's queen on d3 is a major threat.

*   **h8h7:** This seems like a passive move, and doesn't address the immediate threats.
*   **g8f8, g8e8, g8d8, g8c8, g8b8:** Moving the rook doesn't seem to help much.
*   **d7e8, d7d8, d7c8:** Moving the pawn doesn't help.
*   **f6e8, f6h7, f6h5, f6g4, f6e4:** The knight moves are interesting. f6e4 attacks the queen, but it's likely White can recapture. f6h5 looks like it could be a good developing move.
*   **e6f5, e6g4:** These pawn moves don't seem to help.
*   **d6f8, d6e7, d6c5, d6b4, d6a3:** The bishop moves are interesting.
*   **c6d8, c6b8, c6e7, c6a5, c6d4, c6b4:** The bishop moves are interesting.
*   **b7a6, h6g5, d5c4, g7g6, b7b6, h6h5, e5e4, d5d4, b7b5:** Pawn moves.

The most promising move seems to be **f6h5**. This develops the knight, attacks the white pawn on g3, and prepares to challenge white's control of the center.

Okay, I've got a lot of options. White's queen is a threat, and I need to address that. Let's analyze a few key possibilities:

*   **...Qh7:** This looks like a tempting defensive move, but it allows White to develop their attack further.
*   **...g6:** This seems like a solid move to protect the king and prevent White from advancing their pawns further.
*   **...d6:** This could open up the position for my queen, but it might also expose my king more.
*   **...f6:** This prevents White from playing e5 and is a good defensive option.

Considering the position, I think the most solid move is to protect the king and prepare for a counterattack.

I will play g7g6.

Okay, that's a lot of moves. Let's analyze the most critical ones.

*   **h8g8, h8f8, h8e8, h8d8, h8c8, h8b8:** Moving the rook doesn't seem to help much immediately.
*   **a8g8, a8f8, a8e8, a8d8, a8c8, a8b8:** Same as above for the other rook.
*   **h7g8, h7g7:** Moving the pawn on h7 doesn't seem to address the immediate threats.
*   **d7e8, d7d8, d7c8, d7e7:** Moving the queen is tempting, but it could be easily attacked.
*   **d6f8, d6e7, d6c5, d6b4, d6a3:** The knight on d6 has some interesting options, but none immediately save the king.
*   **c6d8, c6b8, c6e7, c6a5, c6d4, c6b4:** The knight on c6 has some interesting options, but none immediately save the king.
*   **h5g7, h5f6, h5f4, h5g3:** The pawn on h5 doesn't seem to help.
*   **b7a6, b7b6, b7b5:** Pushing the b-pawn doesn't seem to help.
*   **h6g5:** Pushing the pawn on h6 doesn't seem to help.
*   **d5c4:** Capturing the pawn with the pawn on d5 is not a good idea.
*   **f7f6, f7f5:** Pushing the f-pawn doesn't seem to help.
*   **e5e4:** Pushing the pawn on e5 doesn't seem to help.
*   **d5d4:** Pushing the pawn on d5 doesn't seem to help.

The most pressing issue is the threat to the king. The queen on d7 is the most active piece. I see a possible escape route for the king.

I'll move the queen to e7, defending the king and potentially opening up some lines for counterplay.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, that's a lot to consider. White is threatening a lot. Let's analyze the key threats and my responses.

*   **White's Queen:** The queen on c3 is a major threat.
*   **White's Knight on g1:** This knight is also a threat.
*   **My King:** My king is somewhat exposed.

I need to develop my pieces and try to create counterplay.

Let's look at some candidate moves:

*   **...h7g8, ...h7g7, ...h8g8, ...h8f8, ...h8e8, ...h8d8, ...h8c8, ...h8b8, ...a8g8, ...a8f8, ...a8e8, ...a8d8, ...a8c8, ...a8b8:** These are all rook moves. They don't seem to immediately address the threats.
*   **...e7f8, ...e7e8, ...e7d8, ...e7d7, ...e7f6:** Queen moves. I don't want to move my queen just yet.
*   **...d6c5, ...d6b4, ...d6a3, ...c6d8, ...c6b8, ...c6a5, ...c6d4, ...c6b4:** Pawn moves.
*   **...h5g7, ...h5f6, ...h5f4, ...h5g3:** Knight moves.
*   **...b7a6, ...h6g5, ...d5c4, ...f7f6, ...b7b6, ...e5e4, ...d5d4, ...f7f5, ...b7b5:** Pawn moves.

I think I should try to develop my knight and create some counterplay. **...Nf6** looks like a good developing move. It attacks the center and prepares to defend.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, I have a lot of options. Let's break this down.

*   **Rook moves:** The rook moves don't seem immediately helpful.
*   **Pawn moves:** `h7g8` is a promotion, but not useful. `b7b6` and `b7b5` are standard pawn moves. `h6g5` and `h6h5` are also pawn moves. `d6c5` and `d6d4` are also pawn moves. `e7d7` is a pawn move.
*   **Knight moves:** `f6g8`, `f6e8`, `f6d7`, `f6h5`, `f6g4`, `f6e4` are knight moves.
*   **King moves:** `e7f8`, `e7e8`, `e7d8`, `e7d7` are king moves.

The most pressing issue is the threat to my king. White's queen and rook on the h-file are a problem. I need to find a way to defend.

I see a few possibilities:

*   **Develop the knight:** Moving the knight on f6 seems promising. `f6h5` attacks the white pawn on g3 and could help control the center. `f6g4` attacks the white knight on h3.
*   **Pawn moves to defend:** `b7b6` or `b7b5` don't seem to help much right now.
*   **King moves:** Moving the king is a possibility, but it's not immediately clear where to go.

I'm leaning towards developing the knight to defend and control the center. Let's try `f6h5`.

*   **Rook moves (h8g8, h8f8, etc. and a8g8, a8f8, etc.):** These don't seem to address the immediate threats.
*   **Pawn moves (h7g8, h7g7, etc.):** Some of these are defensive, but not the most effective.
*   **e7 moves:** e7f8, e7e8, e7d8, e7d7, e7f6: These don't seem to help.
*   **d6 moves:** d6c5, c6d8, c6b8, c6a5, c6d4, c6b4: These are not good.
*   **h5 moves:** h5g7, h5f6, h5f4, h5g3: These are not good.
*   **b7 moves:** b7a6, b7b6, b7b5: These are not good.
*   **h6g5:** This doesn't help.
*   **d5 moves:** d5c4, d5d4: These are not good.
*   **f7 moves:** f7f6, f7f5: These are not good.
*   **e5e4:** This is not good.

The most pressing threat seems to be from the white queen and rook. I need to find a move that defends my king. The move **f7f6** seems like the best option to block the attack.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, I've got a lot of options. Let's analyze the most critical ones:

*   **...h7g8, ...h7g7, ...h7f7, ...h8g8, ...h8f8, ...h8e8, ...h8d8, ...h8c8, ...h8b8, ...a8g8, ...a8f8, ...a8e8, ...a8d8, ...a8c8, ...a8b8:** These are all Rook moves. Moving the Rook on h8 doesn't seem to help much. Moving the Rook on a8 is also not immediately helpful.
*   **...e7f8, ...e7e8, ...e7d8, ...e7d7:** These are Queen moves. The Queen on e7 is under attack. Moving the Queen to f8, e8, d8, or d7 doesn't seem to improve the position significantly.
*   **...d6c5, ...c6d8, ...c6b8, ...c6a5, ...c6d4, ...c6b4:** These are Bishop moves. The Bishop on c6 is under attack. Moving the Bishop to c5, d8, b8, a5, d4, or b4 doesn't seem to be a good option.
*   **...h5g7, ...h5f4, ...h5g3:** These are Knight moves. The Knight on h5 is under attack. Moving the Knight to g7, f4, or g3 doesn't seem to be a good option.
*   **...b7a6, ...b7b6, ...b7b5:** These are Pawn moves. Moving the pawn on b7 to a6, b6, or b5. b6 seems to be the most reasonable option, as it supports the knight on b8.
*   **...h6g5, ...f6g5:** These are Pawn moves. Moving the pawn on h6 or f6.
*   **...d5c4, ...d5d4:** These are Pawn moves. Moving the pawn on d5.
*   **...e5e4:** This is a Pawn move. Moving the pawn on e5.
*   **...f6f5:** This is a Pawn move. Moving the pawn on f6.

Considering the threats and the need for development, I think the best move is to develop the pawn on b7 to b6, supporting the knight on b8 and potentially creating a defensive structure.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Okay, I have a lot of options. Let's analyze.

*   **Rook moves:** The rooks on a8 and h8 have many options, but they are blocked by pawns.
*   **Queen moves:** The queen on h7 has a few options, but none immediately threatening.
*   **King moves:** The king on e7 has a few options, but none seem particularly safe.
*   **Pawn moves:** There are many pawn moves available.
*   **Knight moves:** The knight on b8 has a few options.
*   **Bishop moves:** The bishop on c4 has a few options.

I see that the white king is exposed. I think I can put some pressure on the king. I'll move my queen to g7.

Okay, I've got the legal moves. The position is complex. White has a strong attack, and I need to defend carefully. Let's analyze a few options:

*   **...h8h7:** This seems like a passive move, just preventing a rook lift. Not ideal.
*   **...d5e4:** This looks interesting. It attacks the white queen and opens the diagonal for the black bishop. However, it might expose the king.
*   **...f6f5:** This challenges the center and could create some counterplay.
*   **...d5d4:** This is another option to challenge the center.

After careful consideration, I'll choose to challenge the center and create some counterplay.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, that's a lot to consider. White's queen on e5 is the immediate threat. I need to defend against that while also developing my pieces. Let's analyze some options:

*   **...h8h7:** This doesn't really help.
*   **...g7f6:** This develops a pawn, but doesn't address the immediate threat.
*   **...d5e4:** This attacks the queen, which seems promising.
*   **...f5e4:** This also attacks the queen.

Between d5e4 and f5e4, I think d5e4 is better because it opens the diagonal for my queen.

Let's make the move.

*   **h7**: This move doesn't seem to do much.
*   **f5f4**: This could open the position for an attack.

Qg8+ seems like the most forcing move, as it immediately puts pressure on the king.

Alright, I have a lot of options. Let's break this down.

*   **Rook moves (h8... a8...):** These are mostly defensive, trying to connect the rooks or move them to safer squares.
*   **Pawn moves (g7... e7... d6... b6...):** These are mostly about controlling the center and supporting pieces.
*   **Knight moves (h5...):** The knight on h5 is a bit awkward.
*   **Pawn moves (f5...):** This pawn is defending the king.

Considering the position, I think the most important thing is to consolidate my defense and develop a piece. The knight on h5 is not doing much, so I will move it.

I'll move the queen to g8.

Alright, I've reviewed the legal moves. The position is complex. I need to consider both attack and defense.

*   **Rook moves:** The rook on a8 has several options, but none immediately seem to improve the position. The rook on h8 has a few options as well.
*   **Queen moves:** The queen on g8 has a lot of options, but I don't see an immediate tactical opportunity.
*   **King moves:** The king on e5 has limited options.
*   **Pawn moves:** There are several pawn moves available.
*   **Knight moves:** The knight on c6 has several options.
*   **Bishop moves:** The bishop on d6 has a few options.

The move `h8h7` looks like a reasonable developing move, preparing to potentially defend the king. Let's try that.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, I have the list of legal moves. Let's analyze them. White's attack is focused on the kingside. I need to find a move that either defends the king or creates counterplay.

*   **Rook moves (g8h8, g8f8, g8e8, g8d8, g8c8, g8b8, a8f8, a8e8, a8d8, a8c8, a8b8):** Moving the rooks doesn't seem to immediately address the threats.
*   **Pawn moves (h7h8, h7g7, h7f7, e7f8, e7e8, e7f6, e7e6, b6c5, g6h5, g6g5, f5g4, e5d4, f5f4):** Pawn moves are mostly defensive or trying to create space.
*   **Knight moves (c6d8, c6b8, c6a5, c6d4, c6b4):** The knight on c6 is a key defender.

Considering the position, the most pressing issue is the potential threat to the king. I think the best move here is to move the knight to a square where it can defend the king and potentially create counterplay. **Nc6-d4** looks like a good option. It attacks the white pawn on e2 and potentially opens lines for the queen.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, I've got a lot of options. Let's analyze.

*   **Rook moves (g8h8, g8f8, etc.):** Moving the rook doesn't immediately address the threats and might even weaken my position further.
*   **Pawn moves (h7h8, h7g7, etc.):** Pushing the h-pawn doesn't seem to help much.
*   **Pawn moves (e7f8, e7e8, e7f6, e7e6):** Moving the pawn to e6 looks like a good defensive move, blocking the potential advance of the white pawn on d4 and supporting the knight.
*   **Pawn moves (d6c5, d4e6, d4c6, d4b5, d4f3, d4b3, d4e2, d4c2):** These are all pawn moves, but they don't seem to be the most effective.
*   **Knight moves (g6h5):** Moving the knight doesn't seem to help much.
*   **Pawn moves (b6c5):** This pawn move doesn't seem to help much.
*   **Pawn moves (f5g4):** This pawn move doesn't seem to help much.
*   **Pawn moves (c7c6):** This pawn move doesn't seem to help much.
*   **Pawn moves (g6g5):** This pawn move doesn't seem to help much.
*   **Pawn moves (f5f4):** This pawn move doesn't seem to help much.

I think the best move here is to defend the e7 square and support my knight with **e7e6**. This will also give my king a little more breathing room.

My king is somewhat exposed. White has a strong attack potential. I need to improve the safety of my king and develop my pieces.

I see a few options:

*   **...g6g5:** This challenges the center and opens the g-file, which could be good for my rook.
*   **...c7c6:** This supports the pawn on d6 and prepares to develop the bishop on c8.
*   **...f5f4:** This attacks the pawn on g3 and opens the f-file, but it might weaken my pawn structure.

I think the most solid move is to support the pawn on d6 and prepare to develop the bishop.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Okay, I have a lot of options. White is threatening to push their pawns and attack my king. I need to be careful.

*   **Defensive considerations:** I need to consider moves that defend against immediate threats and prepare for a counterattack.
*   **Development:** Developing my pieces is crucial. I need to get my rooks and knights into the game.
*   **King safety:** My king is somewhat exposed. I need to think about how to improve its safety.

Let's analyze some of the moves:

*   **...g8h8, ...g8f8, ...g8e8, ...g8d8, ...g8c8, ...g8b8:** Moving the queen doesn't seem immediately helpful.
*   **...g8g7:** This looks like a reasonable defensive move, protecting the h7 pawn.
*   **...a8f8, ...a8e8, ...a8d8, ...a8c8, ...a8b8:** Moving the rook doesn't seem to help much at the moment.
*   **...h7h8:** This is a bad move, allowing white to capture the rook.
*   **...h7g7, ...h7f7:** Moving the pawn doesn't seem to help much at the moment.
*   **...e6f7, ...e6e7, ...e6d7, ...e6f6:** These moves with the pawn don't seem to help much.
*   **...d6f8, ...d6b8, ...d6e7, ...d6c7, ...d6c5:** These moves with the bishop don't seem to help much.
*   **...d4b5, ...d4f3, ...d4b3, ...d4e2, ...d4c2:** These moves with the knight don't seem to help much.
*   **...g6h5, ...c6b5, ...b6c5, ...f5g4, ...e4f3, ...g6g5, ...f5f4:** These moves with the pawns don't seem to help much.

I think the best move here is to develop my queen to g7 to defend the h7 pawn. This also opens up a potential diagonal for the queen.

Okay, I have a lot of options. White's knight on f2 is a threat, and the rook on h1 is also a concern. I need to prioritize defending my king and developing my pieces.

*   **a8h8, a8g8, a8f8, a8e8, a8d8, a8c8, a8b8, h7h8, g7h8, g7g8, g7f8, g7f7, g7f6, e6f7, e6e7, e6d7, e6f6, d6f8, d6b8, d6e7, d6c7, d6c5, d4b5, d4f3, d4b3, d4e2, d4c2, g6h5, c6b5, b6c5, f5g4, e5f4, g6g5**

Let's analyze some key moves:

*   **...g6g5**: This looks like a good developing move, challenging the center and opening the g-file for my rook.

I think ...g6g5 is the best move here.

a8h8,a8g8,a8f8,a8e8,a8d8,a8c8,a8b8,h7h8,g7h8,g7g8,g7f8,g7f7,g7g6,g7f6,e6f7,e6e7,e6d7,e6f6,d6f8,d6b8,d6e7,d6c7,d6c5,d4b5,d4f3,d4b3,d4e2,d4c2,c6b5,b6c5,g5f4,f5g4,e5f4,e4e3

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, I have a lot of options. Let's analyze them:

*   **Rook moves (a8...):** Moving the rook on a8 doesn't seem to help much immediately.
*   **Pawn moves (h7h8, g7...):** These are mostly irrelevant at the moment.
*   **Bishop moves (d6...):** The bishop on d6 has some interesting options. Moving it to f8 could block the rook and queen attack, but it also opens up the diagonal for the white bishop. Moving it to e7 or c7 doesn't seem to help much. Moving it to c5 could attack the pawn on b4.
*   **Knight moves (d4...):** The knight on d4 has some interesting options. Moving it to f3 could attack the pawn on g5. Moving it to b3 or c2 doesn't seem to help much. Moving it to e2 could attack the white king, but it also leaves the knight vulnerable.
*   **Pawn moves (c6b5, b6c5, g5f4, f5g4, e5f4, e4e3):** These are mostly defensive or don't seem to have a significant impact.

Considering the immediate threat to my king, I think the most important thing is to try and block the attack. The bishop on d6 seems like the best piece to do that. Moving the bishop to f8 seems like the most logical move, as it blocks the rook and queen attack.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, that's a lot of moves. Let's analyze them:

*   **Bishop moves (f8e7, f8d6, f8c5):** These develop the bishop, but don't immediately address the threats. f8e7 seems like a reasonable developing move.
*   **Rook moves (a8e8, a8d8, a8c8, a8b8):** Moving the rook doesn't seem urgent right now.
*   **Pawn moves (h7h8, g7h8, g7g8, g7f7, g7g6, g7f6, e6f7, e6e7, e6d7, e6f6, c6b5, g5f4, f5g4, e5f4, e4e3):** Many pawn moves. g7f6 or g7f7 look interesting to defend the king.
*   **Queen moves (e6f7, e6e7, e6d7, e6f6):** The queen is currently under attack. Moving it is important. e6f7 defends the king.
*   **Knight moves (d4b5, d4f3, d4b3, d4e2, d4c2):** These moves don't seem to help much.

The most pressing issue is the threat to my king and the queen. I think the best move is to move the queen to f7 to defend the king and develop the queen.

*   **Defensive moves:**
    *   `f8e7`: Develops the bishop, but doesn't address the immediate threats.
    *   `f8d6`: Develops the bishop, but still doesn't address the immediate threats.
    *   `f8c5`: Develops the bishop, but still doesn't address the immediate threats.
    *   `a8e8, a8d8, a8c8, a8b8`: Moving the rook doesn't help the immediate situation.
    *   `h7h8, g7h8, g7g8, g7g6, g7f6`: Pawn moves don't help.
    *   `f7g8, f7e8, f7e7, f7f6, f7e6`: Pawn moves don't help.
    *   `d4e6, d4b5, d4f3, d4b3, d4e2, d4c2`: Knight moves don't help.
    *   `c6b5`: Pawn moves don't help.
    *   `b6c5`: Pawn moves don't help.
    *   `g5f4, f5g4, e5f4, e4e3`: Pawn moves don't help.

The most pressing issue is the potential threat to the king. The queen on g7 is a problem. I need to find a way to defend the king. The move `g7g6` looks like the best option to protect the king.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, I've got a list of legal moves. White is clearly trying to attack. My priorities are:

1.  **King Safety:** The king is vulnerable.
2.  **Development:** Get my pieces active.
3.  **Counterplay:** Try to create some threats of my own.

Let's analyze some of the moves:

*   **...Bg7:** Develops the bishop and potentially helps defend the king.
*   **...Qd6:** Develops the queen and attacks the white pawn on e4. This seems like a good developing move that also creates a threat.
*   **...hxg5:** This is a pawn sacrifice, but it opens the h-file and could lead to an attack on the white king.
*   **...fxg4:** This opens the g-file for my rook, but it also weakens my pawn structure.

Considering all of this, I think the best move is to develop the queen and attack the pawn on e4.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, that's a lot of moves to consider. White is clearly trying to attack the Black King. Let's analyze the most critical moves.

*   **f8g7/f8e7**: Moving the bishop doesn't seem to help much. White can still continue the attack.
*   **a8...**: Moving the rook is also not a priority.
*   **h7h8/h7g7**: Moving the pawn doesn't seem to help.
*   **f7g8/f7e8/f7g7/f7e7/f7e6**: Moving the pawn is not a good option.
*   **d6...**: The queen is the most important piece to defend the king.
*   **d4...**: The queen is the most important piece to defend the king.
*   **h6g5**: Moving the pawn is not a good option.
*   **c6d5/c6b5/c6c5**: Moving the pawn is not a good option.
*   **f5g4/f5f4**: Moving the pawn is not a good option.
*   **e4e3**: Moving the pawn is not a good option.

The most important thing is to defend the king. The queen on d6 is the key defender. I see a few options:

*   **d6e7**: This defends the king and potentially opens a line for the rook.
*   **d6d7**: This defends the king and potentially opens a line for the rook.
*   **d6c7**: This defends the king and potentially opens a line for the rook.
*   **d6e6**: This defends the king and potentially opens a line for the rook.
*   **d6d5**: This defends the king and potentially opens a line for the rook.

Let's consider **d6e7**. This move defends the king from immediate threats and opens the diagonal for the bishop. It also allows the queen to potentially support an attack on the kingside if the opportunity arises.

I'll make the move **d6e7**.

*   **h7h8, g7h8, g7g8, g7f7, e7e8, e7d8:** These pawn moves don't address the immediate threat.
*   **e7f7, e7d7, e7c7, e7b7:** These pawn moves are also not helpful.
*   **e7f6, e7e6, e7d6, e7g5, e7c5, e7b4, e7a3:** These pawn moves are also not helpful.
*   **d4e6, d4b5, d4f3, d4b3, d4e2, d4c2:** The knight moves are not helpful.

*   **e4e3:** This pawn move doesn't help.

The most critical threat is the white queen on e5. I need to move my queen to defend.

I see that I can move my queen to e6. This blocks the check from the white queen and defends my king.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, I've got the legal moves. The most pressing issue is the attack on the king. I need to find a move that defends the king and ideally develops a piece.

*   **f8e7:** Moves the bishop, but doesn't directly address the immediate threats.
*   **f8d6:** Develops the bishop and potentially blocks the rook's attack. This looks promising.
*   **f8c5, f8b4, f8a3:** These moves are less relevant to the immediate defense.
*   **a8e8, a8d8, a8c8, a8b8:** Rook moves, not helpful right now.
*   **h7h8, g7h8, g7g8, g7f7:** Pawn moves, not helpful right now.
*   **e6g8, e6e8, e6c8, e6f7, e6e7, e6d7, e6g6, e6f6, e6d6, e6d5:** Queen moves. Some of these might be useful, but I want to develop a piece first.
*   **h6g5:** Pawn move, not helpful.
*   **c6d5, c6b5, c6c5:** Pawn moves, not helpful.
*   **f5g4, e5d4:** Pawn moves, not helpful.
*   **f5f4:** Pawn move, not helpful.
*   **e4e3:** Pawn move, not helpful.

**f8d6** seems like the best move. It develops my bishop to a good square and blocks the direct attack from the rook on d4.

The pawn on e6 has many options, but it's not a priority. The pawn on d6 has many options, but it's not a priority. The pawn on h6 can move to g5, but it's not a priority. The pawn on c6 can move to c5, but it's not a priority. The pawn on f5 can move to f4, but it's not a priority. The pawn on e5 can move to d4, but it's not a priority.
*   **Bishop moves:** The bishop on d6 has many options, but it's not a priority.
*   **Knight moves:** The knight on c6 has options, but it's not a priority.

I need to address the immediate threat. White's rook on d4 is a problem. I need to develop a piece to defend. The best move seems to be to move my knight to defend.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, I have a list of legal moves. Let's analyze them.

*   **Rook moves (a8...):** The rook on a8 has many options, but moving it along the back rank doesn't seem immediately useful.
*   **Pawn moves (h7h8, g7h8, g7g8, g7f8, g7f7):** The pawn on h7 can promote to a queen, rook, bishop, or knight. The pawn on g7 has several options as well.
*   **Queen moves (e6...):** The queen on e6 has a lot of potential, but I need to be careful not to blunder it.
*   **Bishop moves (d6...):** The bishop on d6 has some diagonal options.
*   **Knight moves (h6g5):** The knight on h6 has one move.
*   **Pawn moves (f5g4, e5d4, f5f4, e4e3):** The pawn on f5 can move one square forward. The pawn on e5 can move one square forward. The pawn on f5 can move one square forward. The pawn on e4 can move one square forward.

The most interesting options seem to be the queen moves and the pawn on h7. I'm going to promote the pawn on h7 to a queen to put immediate pressure on the opponent.

Okay, I see the board. Black's king is in a somewhat exposed position. White has a strong queen and a knight eyeing potential weaknesses. Let's get a list of legal moves to see what options I have.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, I've got a lot of options. The most pressing concern is the potential attack on the king. Let's analyze some of the possibilities:

*   **Defensive moves:** Moves like `h7h6`, `g7g6`, `e7e6`, `c7c6`, `b7b6`, `a7a6` are all passive and don't immediately address the threat.
*   **Developing moves:** `b8c6` develops the knight and controls some central squares. `f6e4` attacks the white queen, but leaves the king vulnerable.
*   **Pawn moves:** `d7d6` is a solid move. `d7e6` and `d7c6` are also possible.

Considering the position, I think developing the knight to c6 is a good developing move that also defends the king.

Okay, I have the legal moves. The position is complex. Black's king is somewhat exposed. White has a strong queen and a potential attack. I need to be careful.

I'll consider a few options:

*   **Developing the queen's rook:** Moving the rook from a8 to c8 or b8 could be useful for defense and potential counterplay.
*   **Pawn moves:** Advancing pawns can control space and restrict white's pieces.
*   **Knight moves:** The knights on c6 and f6 have some interesting options.

After careful consideration, I will move my pawn to control the center.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, I have a lot of options. White's queen is a major threat, and I need to address it. I also need to consider the position of my king.

*   **Defensive Considerations:** Moving the rook on h8 to g8 (h8g8) seems like a reasonable defensive move, potentially guarding against attacks along the g-file.
*   **Development:** Developing the bishop on f6 (f6e8, f6d7) could be useful, but it doesn't immediately address the threat.
*   **Pawn Structure:** Advancing pawns (h7h6, g7g6, etc.) can help control the center and create space, but it might weaken my king's position.
*   **Tactical Possibilities:** There are no immediate tactical opportunities that jump out.

Considering the immediate threat from the white queen and the somewhat exposed king, I think the best move is to develop the rook to g8 to defend the king.

Okay, I have a lot of options. Let's analyze them.

*   **Queen moves:** The queen on d8 has many options, but moving it now doesn't seem immediately advantageous.
*   **Rook moves:** The rooks on a8 and h8 have limited mobility.
*   **Knight moves:** The knight on f6 has several moves. Moving it to e4 looks interesting, attacking the pawn on f2.
*   **Pawn moves:** There are many pawn moves available. Pushing the d-pawn to d4 seems like a good idea to challenge the center.
*   **Bishop moves:** The bishop on g4 has some options.

Considering the position, I think the best move is to challenge the center and develop my pawn.

You are absolutely right! My apologies. I made a mistake. The pawn on d6 can't move to d4 because the square is occupied. I need to be more careful.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, a lot of options. White's attack is a real threat. Let's analyze some of the key moves:

*   **Defensive moves:** Moves like `h7h6`, `g7g6`, `f7f6`, `e7e6`, `b7b6`, `a7a6` and `d5d4` are all about solidifying the pawn structure and trying to weather the storm. These are passive, but might be necessary.
*   **Developing moves:** `g8h8` develops the rook, but doesn't immediately address the threat.
*   **Attacking moves:** `d7e6` and `d7f5` are interesting, as they attack the knight and bishop respectively.
*   **Queen moves:** `d7e8`, `d7d8`, `d7c8` are all about repositioning the queen.

Considering the immediate threat, I think I need to address the attack. The most active defense seems to be to develop my queen and try to create some counterplay. I'll move my queen to e6, attacking the knight and potentially opening lines for my pieces.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, I have a lot of options. White's Queen on f6 is a major threat. I need to find a move that addresses this.

*   **f6h6, f6g6, f6e6, f6g5, f6f5, f6e5, f6f4, f6d4, f6f3, f6c3, f6b2:** These are all moves for the Queen. However, moving the Queen doesn't seem to solve the immediate problems.
*   **c6d8, c6b8, c6e5, c6a5, c6d4, c6b4:** These are Knight moves. The Knight on c6 is currently defending the King. Moving it doesn't seem wise at the moment.
*   **g8h8, a8e8, a8d8, a8c8, a8b8:** These are Rook moves. The Rooks are not in a good position to help defend.
*   **d6d7, h7h6, g7g6, e7e6, b7b6, a7a6, d5d4, h7h5, e7e5, b7b5, a7a5:** These are pawn moves. Some of these could be useful for defense.

I'm going to play **h7h6**. This move defends against a potential check on g7 by the White Queen and prepares for a possible pawn advance to h5 to challenge White's control of the g-file. This also gives the King a potential escape square.

That's a lot of options! Let's analyze this. White's queen is a threat, and my king is somewhat exposed. I need to consider how to defend and develop.

*   **Defensive moves:** I need to consider moves that block the queen's attack or develop pieces to defend the king.
*   **Development:** I should try to develop my pieces to active squares.
*   **Tactical considerations:** Are there any immediate threats or opportunities?

Looking at the moves, `f6g6` and `f6e6` seem like reasonable knight moves, developing the knight. `e7e6` seems like a good pawn move to support the defense. `g7g6` is also a good pawn move to support the king.

I think I'll play `e7e6` to support the king and control the center.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, I've got a lot of options. White's queen and bishop are targeting my king, so I need to prioritize defense. Let's analyze some of the key moves:

*   **...Qe7:** This seems like a good defensive move, blocking the queen's attack and potentially developing the queen to a more active square.
*   **...g6:** This weakens the kingside, but it might be necessary to create some space and prevent a quick checkmate.
*   **...f5:** This challenges white's control of the center and opens lines for my pieces.
*   **...h5:** This is a pawn push that doesn't seem to do much to help the defense.

Considering the immediate threats, ...Qe7 seems like the most solid move. It blocks the queen's attack and prepares for further defense.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, I've got a lot of options. Let's analyze them:

*   **Rook moves:** `g8h8, a8e8, a8d8, a8c8, a8b8` - Moving the rooks doesn't seem immediately helpful.
*   **Queen moves:** `e7e8, e7d8, e7d7, e7f6, e7g5` - The queen is under attack, and I need to move it. `e7f6` looks promising, defending the king and potentially developing the queen to a more active square.
*   **Pawn moves:** `d6d7, g7g6, f7f6, b7b6, a7a6, h6h5, e6e5, d5d4, f7f5, b7b5, a7a5` - Pawn moves are generally less impactful in this situation.
*   **Knight moves:** `c6d8, c6b8, c6e5, c6a5, c6d4, c6b4` - The knight on c6 has several options. `c6e5` looks interesting, attacking the queen and potentially opening lines.
*   **Pawn moves:** `g4h5, g4f5, g4h3, g4f3, h6g5` - These are pawn moves that don't seem to help.

Considering the threats and development, I think the best move is to move the queen to f6, defending the king and developing the queen.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, I've got a lot of options. Let's analyze them.

*   **King Safety:** The king is a priority. Moves like ...Ke7 are tempting, but they don't address the immediate threats.
*   **Development/Defense:** Moves like ...Bg7g6 or ...Bf8e7 are developing moves, but they don't seem to immediately improve the position.
*   **Attacking/Counterplay:** The queen on f6 is well-placed. Moves like ...Qf6h4 could create some pressure, but it might be too risky.
*   **Pawn Structure:** Pushing pawns can open lines, but it can also weaken the king's position.

Considering the position, I think I need to try to improve the king's safety while also creating some counterplay. The move ...Qf6e7 seems like a good option. It develops the queen to a safer square, potentially defends the king, and keeps the queen active.

Okay, I've got the legal moves. The queen on e7 has a lot of options. I think I'll develop my queen to a more active square. I'll move the queen to g5, attacking the pawn on h5.

You are a professional chess player and you play as black. Now is your turn to make a move. Before making a move you can pick one of the following actions:
- 'get_current_board' to get the schema and current status of the board
- 'get_legal_moves' to get a UCI formatted list of available moves
- 'make_move <UCI formatted move>' when you are ready to complete your turn (e.g., 'make_move e2e4')

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, that's a lot of moves. White's queen on g6 is a threat, and I need to address that. Let's analyze the options:

*   **Defensive moves:** `f8e7` (bishop to e7) looks like a good defensive move, developing the bishop and potentially blocking the queen's attack.
*   **Pawn moves:** `g7g6` and `f7f6` seem like reasonable pawn moves to protect the king.
*   **Other moves:** The rook moves don't seem immediately useful. The knight moves are interesting, but I need to be careful about the queen.

I think the best move here is to develop the bishop and defend the king.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Okay, I have a lot of options. Let's analyze them.

*   **Rook moves (g8h8, g8f8, etc.):** These don't seem to immediately address the threat and are passive.
*   **Bishop moves (a8f8, a8e8, e7f8, e7d8, etc.):** The Bishop on e7 is currently blocked, and moving the Rook doesn't seem to help.
*   **Pawn moves:**
    *   **d6d7:** Doesn't help much.
    *   **g7g6, f7f6, h6h5:** These weaken the King's position further.
    *   **b7a6, b7b6, b7b5:** These are slow and don't address the immediate threats.
    *   **e6e5:** This challenges the center, but it also opens the f-file for the white rook.
    *   **d5d4:** This is a possible pawn sacrifice, but it doesn't seem to lead to anything concrete.
    *   **f7f5:** This could be interesting, challenging the center and opening the diagonal for the Bishop.
*   **Knight moves (c6d8, c6b8, c6e5, c6a5, c6d4, c6b4):** The Knight on c6 is well-placed.
    *   **c6e5:** This attacks the Queen and develops the Knight. This looks like a good move!
    *   **c6d4:** This could be interesting, but it allows white to play exd4.
*   **Queen moves (g4h5, g4f5, g4h3, g4f3, g4e2):** These don't seem to be good moves.

**My plan:** I'll move the Knight to e5, attacking the Queen and developing a piece. This forces White to react and gives me some breathing room.

Alright, that's a lot of moves. White's Queen on g4 is a serious threat. I need to consider how to best defend against it and develop my pieces.

*   **g8h8, g8f8, g8e8, g8d8, g8c8, g8b8, a8f8, a8e8, a8d8, a8c8, a8b8:** Rook moves. Not immediately helpful.
*   **e7f8, e7d8:** Bishop moves. Not immediately helpful.
*   **e7f6:** Bishop move. Develops the bishop, but doesn't address the immediate threat.
*   **d6d7, d6c6:** Pawn moves. Doesn't help.
*   **g5g6, g5f6, g5h5, g5f5, g5h4, g5g4, g5f4, g5e3:** Knight moves. The knight on g5 is well-placed. g5h4 attacks the queen.
*   **e5d7, e5g6, e5c6, e5g4, e5c4, e5f3, e5d3:** Knight moves.
*   **b7a6, g7g6, f7f6, c7c6, b7b6, h6h5, d5d4, f7f5, c7c5, b7b5:** Pawn moves.

The most pressing issue is the threat to my King. I think the best move here is to move the knight to h4, attacking the queen and forcing white to respond.

*   **...g6** looks like a good developing move, supporting the f6 Bishop and potentially preparing to challenge the center.
*   **...d4** is tempting, but it opens up the position too much and might expose my King.
*   **...c6** is another developing move, but it doesn't address the immediate threats as well.

I think **...g6** is the most solid and sensible move in this position. It strengthens my kingside defense and prepares for further development.

Okay, I see the board. White has a strong attack developing against my King. I need to defend and develop my pieces. Let's see what moves are available.

d6e7,d6d7,d6e5,d6c5,f6e5

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Okay, I see the available moves. The most pressing issue is the threat to my King. I need to find a move that addresses this.

*   **d6e7**: This move moves the pawn to e7. This doesn't seem to help the immediate threat.
*   **d6d7**: This move moves the pawn to d7. This doesn't seem to help the immediate threat.
*   **d6e5**: This move moves the pawn to e5. This doesn't seem to help the immediate threat.
*   **d6c5**: This move moves the pawn to c5. This doesn't seem to help the immediate threat.
*   **f6e5**: This move moves the pawn to e5. This doesn't seem to help the immediate threat.

None of these moves seem to directly address the immediate threat to my King. I need to re-evaluate the position. I see that the White Queen is a major threat. I need to find a move that develops a piece and defends against the queen.

I will move the pawn to e5, to block the White Queen.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, that's a lot of moves to consider. Let's break this down.

*   **King Safety:** The king on e8 is a bit exposed. Moving the rook on a8 to a safer square is a good idea.
*   **Development:** Black needs to develop pieces and challenge White's control of the center.
*   **Immediate Threats:** White's queen on g5 is a threat.

Considering all of this, I think the best move here is to develop the rook and improve king safety.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, I have a lot of options. Let's analyze them:

*   **Queen moves (g8h8, g8f8, etc.):** Moving the queen doesn't immediately address the threat to my king and doesn't develop any pieces.
*   **Pawn moves (d7d8, d6e7, etc.):** Some of these are interesting. Pushing the d-pawn could open lines, but it's not urgent.
*   **Bishop moves (h4d8, h4e7, etc.):** The bishop on h4 is a key defender. Moving it is risky.
*   **Pawn moves (b7a6, f7f6, etc.):** These are mostly passive.
*   **Pawn moves (d5d4):** This pawn move is interesting. It attacks the white pawn on e4 and opens the diagonal for my bishop.

Considering the position, I think the best move is to challenge the center and open the diagonal for my bishop.

*   **g8h8, g8f8, g8e8, g8d8, g8c8, g8b8, g8a8:** Moving the rook doesn't immediately address the threat.
*   **g8g7:** This is a blunder, allowing the white queen to capture the rook.
*   **d7d8:** Promoting the pawn to a queen doesn't help.
*   **d7e7:** This doesn't help.
*   **d6e7:** This doesn't help.
*   **d6d5:** This doesn't help.

*   **e5h8, e5g7, e5f6, e5f4, e5g3:** Moving the bishop doesn't help.
*   **h4d8, h4e7, h4f6, h4h5, h4g5, h4g4, h4h3, h4g3:** Moving the knight doesn't help.
*   **b7a6, b7b6:** These moves don't help.

*   **...g8g7:** This moves the rook, but doesn't immediately address the queen threat.
*   **...d6d5:** This challenges the center and opens the diagonal for my bishop. It also attacks the pawn on e4.
*   **...c7c6:** This supports the d5 advance and prepares to develop my pieces.
*   **...b7b6:** This is a passive move.
*   **...h6h5:** This is a passive move.
*   **...g6g5:** This is a passive move.
*   **...f6f5:** This is a passive move.
*   **...c7c5:** This is a good move to control the center.

I think ...c7c5 is a good move. It challenges the center and prepares for further development.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, that's a lot of moves. Let's analyze them.

*   **King moves (g8h8, g8f8, g8e8, g8d8, g8c8, g8b8, g8a8, g8g7):** Moving the King is generally not a good idea in this situation. It's already somewhat exposed, and moving it further into the open doesn't help.
*   **Pawn moves (d7d8, d7h7, d7g7, d7f7, d7e7, d7c7, d6e7, d6c7, d6d5, e5f4, e5g3, h4h5, h4g5, h4g4, h4h3, h4g3, b7a6, d4e3, b7b6, h6h5, g6g5, f6f5, c5c4, d4d3):** There are a lot of pawn moves. Some of them are defensive, some are trying to create counterplay.
*   **Other moves:**

Let's prioritize the most pressing issues. White's Queen and Rook on the h-file are a serious threat. I need to address that. The pawn on h6 can be advanced to h5 to block the rook.

Therefore, I will move the h-pawn.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, I've got a lot of options. Let's break this down.

*   **Queen Threat:** White's queen on g7 is a direct threat. I need to address this.
*   **King Safety:** My king is a little exposed.
*   **Development:** I need to develop my pieces.

Considering the queen threat, I see a few options:

*   **...Qxg7:** This seems tempting to capture the queen, but it allows White to recapture with a piece, potentially opening up my king.
*   **...g8g7:** This blocks the queen's attack, but it doesn't develop a piece.

I think the best move is to develop my rook and defend the g7 square.

Alright, I have a list of legal moves. White's queen on g5 is a threat. I need to address that. Let's see...

*   **g7g8** - Promotes the pawn, but to what? A queen would be immediately attacked. A knight or bishop would be better.
*   **g7h7, g7f7, g7e7** - Moving the pawn doesn't seem to help much.
*   **d7d8, d7f7, d7e7, d7c7** - Moving the pawn doesn't seem to help much.
*   **d6e7, d6c6, d6e5, d6d5** - Moving the pawn doesn't seem to help much.
*   **h4g5, h4g4, h4h3** - Moving the pawn doesn't seem to help much.
*   **g3e5, g3f4, g3h2, g3f2** - Moving the bishop doesn't seem to help much.
*   **b7a6, a7b6** - Moving the pawn doesn't seem to help much.
*   **h5g4** - Moving the pawn doesn't seem to help much.
*   **d4e3** - Moving the pawn doesn't seem to help much.
*   **g6g5** - Moving the pawn doesn't seem to help much.
*   **f6f5** - Moving the pawn doesn't seem to help much.
*   **e6e5** - Moving the pawn doesn't seem to help much.
*   **c5c4** - This looks like the best move. It attacks the queen and forces a response.

I'll play **c5c4**.

*   **g7g8=Q, g7g8=R, g7g8=B, g7g8=N:** Promoting the pawn on g7 is tempting, but the resulting queen is unlikely to survive.
*   **g7h7, g7f7, g7e7:** These pawn moves don't help the defense.
*   **d7d8=Q, d7d8=R, d7d8=B, d7d8=N:** Similar to the g-pawn, promoting this pawn is unlikely to help.
*   **d7f7, d7e7, d7c7:** These pawn moves don't help the defense.
*   **d6e7, d6c6, d6e5, d6d5, d6c5:** These moves with the pawn on d6 don't seem to improve the situation.
*   **h4g5, h4g4, h4h3, h4h2:** These knight moves don't seem to help the defense.
*   **g3e5, g3f4, g3h2, g3f2:** These bishop moves don't seem to help the defense.
*   **b7a6, a7b6:** These pawn moves don't help the defense.
*   **f6g5:** This move with the pawn on f6 doesn't seem to improve the situation.
*   **h5g4:** This move with the pawn on h5 doesn't seem to improve the situation.
*   **d4e3, c4d3:** These moves with the pawn on d4 and c4 don't seem to help the defense.
*   **f6f5:** This pawn move seems to open up lines for my queen.
*   **e6e5:** This pawn move seems to open up lines for my queen.
*   **c4c3:** This pawn move doesn't seem to help the defense.

After careful consideration, I'm going to play **f6f5**. This opens the f-file for my queen and potentially creates some counterplay.

Alright, I have a lot of options. Let's analyze a bit. The immediate threat is the rook on h1. I need to address that.

*   **g7g8=Q:** Promoting the pawn to a queen seems tempting, but it doesn't immediately solve the threat.
*   **g7h7, g7f7, g7e7:** These moves don't help.
*   **d7d8=Q:** Also not immediately helpful.
*   **d6e7, d6c6, d6e5, d6d5, d6c5:** These moves with the pawn don't seem to address the threat.
*   **h4h8, h4h7, h4h6, h4h5, h4g5, h4h3, h4h2:** These moves with the queen don't seem to help.
*   **g3e5, g3f4, g3h2, g3f2:** These moves with the knight don't seem to help.
*   **b7a6, a7b6:** These moves with the pawns don't seem to help.
*   **d4e3, c4d3:** These moves with the pawns don't seem to help.
*   **e6e5:** This pawn move seems to be the best option. It blocks the rook's attack and opens up a line for the queen.
*   **f5f4:** This pawn move doesn't seem to help.
*   **c4c3:** This pawn move doesn't seem to help.

Therefore, I will move my pawn to e5.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, that's a lot of moves. Let's analyze the most promising ones.

*   **g7g8=Q**: Promoting the pawn to a queen seems tempting, but it doesn't immediately win.
*   **h4h3**: This attacks the king, but white can move the king to a safe square.
*   **d6e7**: This captures a pawn and opens up the diagonal for the queen, but it doesn't seem to lead to a quick win.
*   **d6d5**: This opens the diagonal for the queen and attacks the pawn on e4.
*   **c4c3**: This attacks the pawn on d3.

The most forcing move seems to be **h4h3**, forcing the king to move. Then I can follow up with other moves.

*   **Qg6+** This looks tempting, attacking the king directly. However, it's not checkmate.
*   **...d6e7** This opens up the diagonal for the queen and could lead to a quick attack.
*   **...c4c3** This could open up the c-file for my rook.

I'm going to go with **Qg6+**. It forces a response from white and keeps the pressure on.

Alright, I've got a list of legal moves. The most pressing issue seems to be the potential threat to the king. I need to consider both defensive and offensive options.

*   **Pawn moves:** Several pawn moves are available. `g7g6` seems like a reasonable move to protect the king. `d6e7`, `d6e6`, `d6c5` are also possible, but don't seem to improve the position significantly.
*   **Bishop moves:** `f5e4` looks interesting, attacking the pawn on e4.
*   **Other moves:** The other moves don't seem to offer immediate advantages.

Considering the position and the need to protect the king, I'll move the pawn on g7 to g6.

Okay, I have a lot of options. Let's analyze them.

*   **Pawn moves:** `d7d8`, `d7h7`, `d7g7`, `d7f7`, `d7e7`, `d7c7`, `g6g8`, `g6g7`, `g6h6`, `g6f6`, `g6e6`, `d6e7`, `d6e6`, `d6c5`, `h3h8`, `h3h7`, `h3h6`, `h3h5`, `h3h4`, `h3h2`, `h3g2`, `g3h4`, `g3f4`, `g3h2`, `g3f2`, `a7b6`, `f5e4`, `c4d3`, `a7a6`, `f5f4`, `c4c3` - There are many pawn moves, but most of them don't seem immediately useful. I need to focus on developing pieces and controlling the center.

*   **Piece moves:** `f5e4`, `c4d3` - The bishop on c4 is a bit passive. Moving the bishop on f5 to e4 seems interesting, as it attacks the pawn on d2 and opens up the diagonal for the queen.

Considering the position, I think developing the bishop to e4 is a good developing move that also puts some pressure on white.

*   **Pawn moves:** `d7d8`, `d7h7`, `d7g7`, `d7f7`, `d7e7`, `d7c7`, `g6g8`, `g6g7`, `g6h6`, `g6f6`, `g6e6`, `d6e7`, `d6e6`, `d6d5`, `d6c5`, `g4f3`, `e4f3`, `e4d3`, `c4d3`, `a7a6`, `e4e3`, `c4c3` - These are the most common moves. I need to consider which pawn moves are best in this situation.
*   **Rook moves:** `h3h8`, `h3h7`, `h3h6`, `h3h5`, `h3h4`, `h3h2`, `h3g2` - The rook on h3 is a threat, but I can't directly attack it.
*   **Knight moves:** `a7b6` - This knight move doesn't seem to help much.

The most pressing issue is the attack on my king. I need to consider moves that defend my king and potentially develop a counterattack.

*   `d6d5` looks interesting. It challenges the center and opens lines for my pieces.
*   `d6e6` could also be a good move.
*   `g6g7` looks like a good move to protect my king.

I think the best move is to protect my king with the pawn.

*   **...g7g6:** This move defends the h7 square, preventing a potential checkmate threat.
*   **...d6e7:** This move moves the king to a safer square.

I think the most important thing is to secure the king. Let's move the king.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Okay, I have a lot of options. Let's analyze them.

*   **Pawn moves:** `g7g8`, `g7h7`, `g7f7`, `g7g6`, `e7f8`, `e7e8`, `e7d8`, `e7f7`, `e7f6`, `e7e6`, `e7d6`, `d7d8`, `d7c7`, `d7d6`, `d7d5`, `a7b6`, `a7a6`, `c4d3`, `c4c3` - These are all pawn moves. I don't want to promote my pawn on g7 yet, and I don't want to weaken my pawn structure too much. `d7d6` seems like a reasonable developing move, supporting my pawn on e7.
*   **Knight moves:** `g3h4`, `g3f4`, `g3h2`, `g3f2`, `g3e1` - The knight on g3 has several options. `g3f4` attacks the center and could be a good developing move.
*   **Bishop moves:** `e4f3`, `e4d3` - The bishop on e4 has limited options. `e4f3` is a good developing move, and it attacks the knight.
*   **Queen moves:** `h3h8`, `h3h7`, `h3h6`, `h3h5`, `h3h4`, `h3h2`, `h3g2` - The queen on h3 has many options.

Considering the position, I think the best move is to develop my knight to f4, attacking the center and putting pressure on White's pieces.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Okay, I have a lot of options. Let's analyze a bit.

*   **Pawn moves:** Moving the pawns on the g and e files seem like the most immediate options. g7-g6 looks like a good developing move, and it helps to defend the king. e7-e6 also looks good.
*   **Bishop moves:** The bishop on f4 has a few options, but none of them seem particularly impactful right now.
*   **Other moves:** The other pawn moves don't seem to help much.

I think **g7-g6** is the best move here. It develops a pawn, defends the king, and prepares for further development.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, I have a good list of moves. Let's analyze a bit.

*   **e7f8, e7e8, e7d8:** These pawn promotions look interesting. Promoting to a queen could be good, but let's see if there's a better option.
*   **e7f7, e7f6, e7e6:** These are standard pawn moves.
*   **d7d8, d7c7, d7d6, d7d5:** These are pawn moves.
*   **g6g8, g6g7, g6h6, g6f6, g6e6, g6d6, g6c6, g6b6:** These are bishop moves. The bishop on f4 is a bit restricted.
*   **f4g3, f4e3, f4h2, f4d2, f4c1:** These are bishop moves.
*   **h3h8, h3h7, h3h6, h3h5, h3h4, h3g3, h3f3, h3h2, h3g2:** These are rook moves.
*   **a7b6:** This is a pawn move.
*   **g4f3, e4f3, e4d3:** These are pawn moves.
*   **a7a6:** This is a pawn move.
*   **g4g3, e4e3:** These are pawn moves.

The position is complex. White has a strong attack. I need to defend and try to create counterplay. I think promoting the pawn on e7 to a queen is the best option. It will give me more attacking power.

The most pressing issue seems to be the exposed king. White has a queen on g2, and rooks on a1 and h1. Black's king on e8 is somewhat vulnerable. I need to prioritize king safety.

Looking at the pawn moves, `d7d6` seems like a good developing move, supporting the king. `e8f7` could also be considered.

I'll play `d7d6` to solidify the pawn structure and give the king a little more breathing room.

I'll move my bishop from f4 to e3, attacking the pawn on d2 and potentially opening up lines for my queen.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Okay, I've got a lot of options. The most immediate threat is the queen. I need to consider how to develop my pieces and attack White's king.

*   **h8g8/h8f8/h8h7/h8g7/h8h6/h8f6/h8h5/h8h4/h8h3/h8h2:** Queen moves. Moving the queen to attack the king is tempting, but it might not be the best immediate move.
*   **e8f8/e8d8/e8f7/e8e7/e8d7:** King moves. The king is relatively safe for now.
*   **g6g8/g6g7/g6h6/g6f6/g6e6:** Pawn moves. These don't seem to be the most impactful moves right now.
*   **d6d8/d6d7/d6f6/d6e6/d6c6/d6b6/d6d5:** Pawn moves. These don't seem to be the most impactful moves right now.
*   **e3f4/e3f2/e3d2/e3g1/e3c1:** Bishop moves. The bishop could be useful, but it's blocked at the moment.
*   **b7a6:** Pawn moves. This doesn't seem to be the most impactful moves right now.
*   **a7b6:** Pawn moves. This doesn't seem to be the most impactful moves right now.
*   **g4f3/e4f3/e4d3:** Pawn moves. These don't seem to be the most impactful moves right now.
*   **g4g3:** Pawn moves. This doesn't seem to be the most impactful moves right now.

I think the best move is to develop my queen to a more active square and put pressure on the king. I'll move my queen to h7, attacking the king.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Okay, that's a lot of moves. Let's analyze them.

*   **King moves:** e8f8, e8d8, e8f7, e8e7, e8d7 - Moving the king is risky with the queen on the board.
*   **Pawn moves:** h7h8, h7g8, h7g7, h7f7, h7e7, h7d7, h7c7, h7h6, h7h5, h7h4, h7h3, h7h2, g6g8, g6g7, g6h6, g6f6, g6e6, d6d8, d6d7, d6f6, d6e6, d6c6, d6b6, d6d5, e4d3, g4g3 - Many pawn moves, some of which are potentially good.
*   **Bishop moves:** e3f4, e3f2, e3d2, e3g1, e3c1 - The bishop is blocked.
*   **Other pawn moves:** b7a6, a7b6, g5f4, e5f4 - These are pawn moves.

The most pressing threat is the white queen. I need to address that. I see a few options.

1.  **d6d5:** This pawn move attacks the white pawn on e4, and opens the diagonal for the bishop.
2.  **g6g5:** This pawn move attacks the white pawn on f4.

I'm going to choose to develop my pawn and attack the white pawn.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Okay, I have the legal moves. I need to move the king, block the check, or capture the queen.

*   **King moves:** e8f8, e8d8, e8f7, e8e7, e8d7.
*   **Queen capture:** None.
*   **Block:** g6g8, g6g7, g6h6, g6f6, g6e6, g6d6, g6c6, g6b6, d5d8, d5d7, d5d6, d5e5, d5c5, d5b5, d5a5, e3f4, e3f2, e3d2, e3g1, e3c1, b7a6, a7b6, e4d3, g4g3.

I can move the king to f8, d8, f7, e7, or d7. I can also block with the pawn on g6 by moving it to g7 or g8, or with the pawn on d5 by moving it to d6, d7, or d8.

Moving the king seems risky, as it could lead to further attacks. Blocking with the pawn on g6 seems like a good option. Moving the pawn to g7 blocks the check and protects the king.

Therefore, I will move the pawn on g6 to g7.

The position is a bit tricky. White has a strong attack. I need to be careful. Let's analyze the moves.

*   **King moves:** Moving the king doesn't seem to improve the position significantly.
*   **g7d7:** This is not a legal move.
*   **d5d7:** This is not a legal move.

The most important thing is to defend the king. The move **e7e6** seems like the most logical move. It blocks the check from the rook on e4 and gives the king a little more breathing room.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, I've got a lot of options. Let's analyze them.

*   **Pawn moves:** The pawn moves are mostly defensive, trying to block the white attack. `h7h6`, `h7h5`, `g7g6`, `e6e5` look like they might help.
*   **Rook moves:** The rook moves are less useful in this position.
*   **King moves:** The king moves are not safe.
*   **Bishop moves:** The bishop moves are not useful.
*   **Other moves:** `e4d3`, `d4c3` are not useful.

The most critical threat is the white rook on e4. I need to address this. Also, I need to develop my pieces.

I think the best move here is to try and trade the rooks to relieve some pressure.

`g7g6` looks like a good move. It blocks the white rook and prepares to develop my pieces.

You are a professional chess player and you play as black. Now is your turn to make a move. Before making a move you can pick one of the following actions:
- 'get_current_board' to get the schema and current status of the board
- 'get_legal_moves' to get a UCI formatted list of available moves
- 'make_move <UCI formatted move>' when you are ready to complete your turn (e.g., 'make_move e2e4')

Okay, I see the board. White has a strong attack developing, and my king is a bit exposed. I need to find a move that addresses the immediate threats and improves my position. Let's see what legal moves I have.

h7h8,h7g8,h7g7,h7f7,h7e7,h7d7,h7c7,h7h6,h7h5,h7h4,h7h3,h7h2,g6g8,g6g7,g6h6,g6f6,e6e7,e6f5,e6e5,d5d8,d5d7,d5d6,d5e5,d5c5,d5b5,d5a5,e3f4,e3f2,e3d2,e3g1,e3c1,a7b6,e4d3,d4c3,a7a6,g4g3

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, I've got a lot of options. Let's analyze them.

*   **Pawn moves:** h7-h8, g6-g8, e6-e7, d5-d8, d5-d7, d5-d6, a7-a6, g4-g3. These are mostly pawn pushes. Some promote a pawn, but none seem immediately critical.
*   **Pawn captures:** h7xg8, g6xf6, d5xe5, d5xc5, d5xb5, e4xd3, d4xc3. Some captures are available, but none are immediately critical.
*   **Other pawn moves:** h7-h6, h7-h5, h7-h4, h7-h3, h7-h2, g6-h6, g6-f6, e6-f5, e6-e5, d5-e5, d5-a5, e3-f4, e3-f2, e3-d2, e3-g1, e3-c1, a7-b6. These are mostly pawn pushes.
*   **Queen moves:** None.
*   **Rook moves:** None.
*   **Bishop moves:** None.
*   **Knight moves:** None.
*   **King moves:** None.

The most pressing issue is the potential threat to my king. White's rook on e1 and the bishop on f5 are a concern. I also need to develop my pieces.

Considering the position, I think the best move is to develop my pawn to g6-g7. This blocks the rook on g1 and opens a line for my rook.

Alright, that's a lot of moves. Let's analyze them.

*   **Pawn moves (h7...):** Pushing the h-pawn doesn't seem to help much. It doesn't directly address the threats.
*   **Pawn moves (g7...):** Similar to the h-pawn, these moves don't seem to improve the situation significantly.
*   **Pawn moves (e6...):** e6e7 is a possibility, but it doesn't seem to help. e6e5 looks interesting, potentially opening the position.
*   **Pawn moves (d5...):** These moves are also not very helpful.
*   **Pawn moves (e3...):** These moves are not possible.
*   **Pawn moves (b7...):** b7a6 is a possibility, but it doesn't seem to help.
*   **Pawn moves (a7...):** a7b6 is a possibility, but it doesn't seem to help.
*   **Pawn moves (e4...):** These moves are not possible.
*   **Pawn moves (d4...):** These moves are not possible.
*   **Pawn moves (g4...):** g4g3 is a possibility, but it doesn't seem to help.

The most promising move seems to be **e6e5**. This opens the position and potentially creates some counterplay. It also challenges the center.

Alright, that's a lot of moves. Let's analyze the most promising ones.

*   **h7h6, h7h5, h7h4, h7h3, h7h2:** Pushing the h-pawn doesn't seem to achieve much immediately.
*   **g7g6:** This move seems passive.
*   **e5f6, e5f5, e5f4:** These moves with the pawn are interesting, potentially opening lines.
*   **d5d8, d5d7, d5d6, d5c5, d5b5:** The queen is a powerful piece, but moving it right now doesn't seem to immediately improve the position.
*   **e3f4, e3f2, e3d2, e3g1, e3c1:** These moves with the bishop don't seem to be helpful.
*   **b7a6, a7b6:** These moves with the pawns don't seem to be helpful.
*   **e4d3, d4c3:** These moves with the pawns don't seem to be helpful.
*   **g4g3:** This move with the pawn doesn't seem to be helpful.

The most interesting move seems to be **e5f4**. This attacks the pawn on g2 and opens the diagonal for the bishop.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, that's a lot of moves. Let's break this down.

*   **Rook moves (h7):** The rook on h7 has a lot of options. Moving it to h8 to promote the pawn seems tempting, but it might just get captured. Moving it to h6, h5, or h4 doesn't seem to improve the position significantly. g8, g6, f5 are also possible.
*   **Pawn moves:** The pawn on g7 can move to g8, but promoting to a queen might be a mistake. g6 is also a possibility. The pawn on d5 has a lot of options, but none of them seem particularly good.
*   **Other moves:** The pawn on f4 has some options, but they don't seem to help. The bishop on e3 has some moves, but they don't seem to improve the position. The knight on b7 can move to a6, and the pawn on a7 can move to b6.
*   **King moves:** The king on e4 has a few options, but they don't seem to help.
*   **Other pawn moves:** g5h4, e4d3, d4c3, g4g3, g4h3

The most pressing issue seems to be the attack on the h-file. I think I need to address that immediately. I'll move the rook to h6 to defend.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, I have a lot of options. Let's analyze them.

*   **Pawn moves:** `g7g8`, `g7h7`, `g7f7`, `g7e7`, `g7d7`, `g7c7`, `g7g6`, `h6h8`, `h6h7`, `h6g6`, `h6f6`, `h6e6`, `h6d6`, `h6c6`, `h6b6`, `h6h5`, `h6h4`, `d5d8`, `d5d7`, `d5d6`, `f4f5`, `g4g3` - These are mostly defensive or developing moves. `g7g8` is a promotion, but it's not immediately clear what to promote to. Pushing the pawns on the kingside might create some space, but also weakens the king further. `d5d6` looks interesting, challenging the center.
*   **Knight moves:** `d5f5`, `d5e5`, `d5c5`, `d5b5` - The knight on d5 is well-placed. Moving it could be useful. `d5f5` attacks the bishop, but it's not a huge threat. `d5e5` attacks the queen, which is interesting.
*   **Bishop moves:** `f4e5`, `f4g3`, `f4f3` - The bishop on f4 is also well-placed.
*   **Queen moves:** `e3f2`, `e3d2`, `e3g1`, `e3c1` - The queen is a bit passive.
*   **Other moves:** `b7a6`, `a7b6`, `g5h4`, `e4d3`, `d4c3` - These are not very useful.

Considering the threats, I think the most active move is to challenge the center and develop my knight.

Okay, I see the board. White has a strong attack developing, especially with the queen on h3. My king is somewhat exposed. I need to find a move that addresses the immediate threats and tries to develop my pieces. Let's get the legal moves.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Okay, I have a lot of options. Let's analyze them:

*   **Pawn moves (h6, g7, e5, f4):** Pushing the h-pawn doesn't seem to help much. g7-g6 or g7-g5 might be useful later. e5-e6 or e5-e7 could be interesting, but it's not the most pressing issue. f4-f5 is also not a priority.
*   **King moves (e5):** The king has very limited options.
*   **Other moves:** a7-a6 or a7-a5 are passive.

The most pressing issue is the threat to my king and the development of my pieces. I think I need to try to activate my rook on h8. I'll move the pawn to h7 to open the way for the rook.

Alright, that's a lot of moves. Let's analyze them.

*   **Pawn moves:** I have a few pawn moves available.
    *   `h7h8`: Promoting the pawn to a queen is tempting, but it doesn't seem to improve the position immediately.
    *   `h7g8`: Promoting the pawn to a knight is also an option.
    *   `h7h6, h7g6, h7h5, h7f5, h7h4`: These moves don't seem to help much.
    *   `g7g8`: Promoting the pawn to a queen is tempting, but it doesn't seem to improve the position immediately.
    *   `g7f7, g7e7, g7d7, g7c7, g7b7, g7g6`: These moves don't seem to help much.
    *   `e5e8`: Promoting the pawn to a queen is tempting, but it doesn't seem to improve the position immediately.
    *   `e5e7, e5e6, e5f5, e5d5, e5c5, e5b5`: These moves don't seem to help much.
    *   `f4f5`: This move doesn't seem to help much.
    *   `g5h4`: This move doesn't seem to help much.
    *   `a7b6`: This move doesn't seem to help much.
    *   `e4d3`: This move doesn't seem to help much.
    *   `d4c3`: This move doesn't seem to help much.
    *   `a7a6, g4g3, a7a5`: These moves don't seem to help much.
*   **Other moves:**
    *   `f4g3, f4f3`: These moves don't seem to help much.
    *   `e3f2, e3d2, e3g1, e3c1`: These moves don't seem to help much.

The most important thing is to defend my king. I need to look for moves that block attacks or develop pieces to defend.

I'm going to try to develop my pawn to h6, to provide some protection for my king.

Alright, that's a lot of moves. Let's analyze them.

*   **Pawn moves:** Many pawn moves are available. Pushing the g-pawn seems like a bad idea as it opens the g-file to the white rook. The h-pawn moves don't seem to help much either. The e-pawn can promote, but that's not the priority. The f-pawn can advance, but it doesn't immediately address the threat.

*   **King moves:** The king has no safe moves.

*   **Other moves:** The bishop on e5 can move, but it doesn't seem to help.

The most pressing issue is the attack on the king. I need to find a way to defend. The best move seems to be to move the pawn on e5 to e6 to block the queen's attack.

Alright, I've got a lot of moves to consider. Let's analyze the situation. White's queen and rooks are bearing down on my king. My pawn on h6 is under attack. I need to find a move that defends the king and potentially creates some threats.

*   **h6 moves:** h6h8, h6f8, h6h7, h6g7, h6h5, h6h4 - These moves are all about the pawn on h6. Moving it to h7 or h5 doesn't seem to help much. Promoting it to a queen or knight is interesting, but I don't see an immediate win.
*   **g6 moves:** g6g8, g6g7, g6f6 - These moves are about the pawn on g6. Moving it to g7 doesn't seem to help.
*   **e6 moves:** e6e8, e6e7, e6f6, e6d6, e6c6, e6b6, e6e5 - These moves are about the pawn on e6. Moving it to e7 doesn't seem to help.
*   **f4 moves:** f4e5, f4g3 - These moves are about the pawn on f4.
*   **e3 moves:** e3d4, e3f2, e3d2, e3g1, e3c1 - These moves are about the knight on e3.
*   **a7 moves:** a7b6, a7a6, a7a5 - These moves are about the pawn on a7.
*   **g5 moves:** g5h4 - This move is about the pawn on g5.
*   **e4 moves:** e4d3 - This move is about the pawn on e4.

The most pressing threat is the attack on my king. I need to find a move that addresses this. Moving the pawn on h6 to h5 seems like the best option to defend the king.

Okay, I have a lot of options. Let's analyze them.

*   **Pawn moves:** g6g8, g6g7, g6h6, g6f6, e6e8, e6e7, e6f6, e6d6, e6c6, e6b6, e6e5, h5h8, h5h7, h5h6, h5h4, a7b6, a7a6, a7a5, g4g3. These are mostly pawn moves. Some of these are trying to promote a pawn, but it's too late.
*   **Queen moves:** e4d3, e4g3, e4f2, e4d2, e4g1, e4c1. These are queen moves.
*   **Knight moves:** g5h4. This is a knight move.

The most critical threat is the white rooks on the open files. I need to try to create some counterplay. The queen is my most powerful piece, so I need to use it effectively.

*   **e4d3** attacks the white knight and opens up a potential attack on the white king.
*   **e4g3** attacks the white knight and the white bishop.
*   **e4f2** is a check and attacks the rook.
*   **e4d2** attacks the rook.
*   **e4g1** attacks the rook.
*   **e4c1** attacks the rook.

**e4f2** looks like the most forcing move, as it's a check.

Let's try that.

Okay, the move `e4f2` failed. I must have made a mistake in my analysis or the move is illegal in the current position. Let me re-examine the board and the legal moves.

Okay, I have the legal moves again. I see the problem. I was trying to move the queen to f2, but the pawn on f4 is blocking that move. I need to re-evaluate my options.

*   **e4d3** attacks the white knight.
*   **e4g3** attacks the white knight and the white bishop.
*   **e3d4** attacks the white knight.
*   **e3f2** is a check and attacks the rook.
*   **e3d2** attacks the rook.
*   **e3g1** attacks the rook.
*   **e3c1** attacks the rook.

The best move is to attack the knight with the queen.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Okay, I see the board. White has a significant material advantage, including two rooks and a bishop for a queen. Black's king is somewhat exposed. I need to find a move that improves my position and creates some threats.

Let's see what legal moves I have.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Proxy (to Player_Black):

g6g8,g6g7,g6h6,g6f6,e6e8,e6e7,e6f6,e6d6,e6c6,e6b6,e6e5,e6e4,h5h8,h5h7,h5h6,h5h4,f4e5,f4e4,f4g3,e3d4,e3f2,e3d2,e3g1,e3c1,a7b6,g5h4,a7a6,g4g3,d3d2,a7a5

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Okay, I've got a lot of options. Let's analyze them.

*   **Pawn moves:** g6g8, g6g7, g6h6, g6f6, e6e8, e6e7, e6f6, e6d6, e6c6, e6b6, e6e5, e6e4, h5h8, h5h7, h5h6, h5h4, a7b6, a7a6, g4g3, d3d2, a7a5. Many of these are pawn pushes, but none immediately seem to create a decisive advantage or threat.

*   **Queen moves:** e3d4, e3f2, e3d2, e3g1, e3c1. The queen has a lot of potential, but it's currently blocked. Moving the queen doesn't seem to create a clear advantage.

*   **Other moves:** f4e5, f4e4, f4g3, g5h4. These are all pawn moves.

Considering the board and the available moves, I think the best move is to try to develop a threat and put pressure on the white king. The pawn on g6 can move to g5, attacking the white knight.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

You are absolutely right! I made a mistake. The move g6g5 is illegal because the pawn on g6 can't move two squares. I need to be more careful.

Let's re-evaluate. The queen is a key piece, and I need to find a way to activate it. The pawn on e6 can move to e5, opening the diagonal for the queen and potentially attacking the white knight.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, I've got a lot of options. Let's analyze.

*   **h5...** Pawn moves. Pushing the h-pawn doesn't seem to accomplish much immediately.
*   **e5...** Queen moves. This is interesting. The queen is currently defending the king and can move to many squares.
*   **f4...** Bishop moves. This bishop is currently blocked.
*   **e3...** Bishop moves. This bishop is currently blocked.
*   **a7...** Pawn moves. These are standard pawn moves.
*   **g5...** Pawn moves. This pawn is defending the king.
*   **g4...** Pawn moves. This pawn is defending the king.
*   **d3...** Pawn moves. This pawn is defending the king.

The most pressing issue is the threat to my king. The white rooks are a threat. I need to develop my pieces and try to create some counterplay.

I think the best move here is to develop my queen to a more active square. Moving the queen to e7 seems like a good option. It defends the king, and it opens up lines for my pieces.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Alright, I have a lot of options. Let's analyze them:

*   **Pawn moves (e7...):** The pawn on e7 has several options. Moving it to e6 or e5 seems like a good way to challenge the center and open lines for the queen. However, e6 might allow white to further attack. e5 looks more promising.
*   **Pawn moves (h5...):** The pawn on h5 can move to h6, h7, or h8. h6 seems like a good defensive move to protect the king.
*   **Pawn moves (f4...):** The pawn on f4 can move to e5, g3, or f3.
*   **Queen moves (e3...):** The queen on e3 has many moves.
*   **Pawn moves (a7...):** The pawn on a7 can move to a6 or a5.
*   **Pawn moves (g5...):** The pawn on g5 can move to h4.
*   **Pawn moves (g4...):** The pawn on g4 can move to g3.

Considering the position and the need to defend and develop, I will move the pawn on h5 to h6. This helps protect the king and prevents any immediate back-rank threats.

Okay, I see the available moves. I have a few options with my pawn on f4. I can move it to e5 or g3. I also have a pawn on e3 that can move to f2, and promote to a queen, rook, bishop, or knight.

Let's analyze. Moving the pawn to e5 seems like a good developing move, potentially opening up the position. Moving the pawn to g3 doesn't seem to achieve much. Promoting the pawn on e3 seems tempting, but I need to be careful about the resulting position.

Given the position, I think the best move is to push the pawn to e5. This opens up the position and challenges white's control of the center.

Okay, I've reviewed the legal moves. The position is a bit tricky. White's queen is a threat. I need to be careful.

I'm going to move my pawn to defend the king and open up a potential escape route.

You are a professional chess player and you play as black. Now is your turn to make a move. Before making a move you can pick one of the following actions:
- 'get_current_board' to get the schema and current status of the board
- 'get_legal_moves' to get a UCI formatted list of available moves
- 'make_move <UCI formatted move>' when you are ready to complete your turn (e.g., 'make_move e2e4')

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, I have a lot of options. White's threat is immediate. Let's analyze this carefully.

*   **e7e8**: Promoting the pawn is tempting, but it doesn't immediately address the threat.
*   **h6h8, h6f8, h6h7, h6g7, h6g6, h6h5, h6h4**: Moving the pawn doesn't help much.
*   **e6d7, e6d6, e6e5**: Moving the pawn doesn't help much.
*   **e3b6, e3c5, e3f4, e3d4, e3f2, e3d2, e3g1, e3c1**: The bishop moves are not helpful.
*   **a7b6, a7a6, a7a5**: Moving the pawn doesn't help much.
*   **g5h4, g4f3, g4g3**: These moves don't help.
*   **e2e1q, e2e1r, e2e1b, e2e1n**: Promoting the pawn is tempting, but it doesn't immediately address the threat.

The most pressing issue is the attack on my king. I need to find a move that defends the king or creates counterplay. Looking at the board, I see that I can move my pawn to d7 to block the check from the rook.
