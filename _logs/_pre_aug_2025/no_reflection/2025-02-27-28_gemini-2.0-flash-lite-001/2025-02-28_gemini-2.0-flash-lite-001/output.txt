Okay, I have a lot of options. Let's think about this. White has a standard setup. I want to develop my pieces and control the center. The move ...d7-d5 looks like a good way to challenge white's control of the center. It opens lines for my queen and bishop and supports a potential advance of my e-pawn later.

Therefore, I will play d7-d5.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, I have a lot of options. White has pushed their central pawns, so I need to develop my pieces and challenge their control of the center.

*   **g8f6:** Developing the knight to f6 is a solid developing move, controlling important central squares.
*   **e8e7:** Moving the king is not a developing move, so I will not do that.
*   **d8d7:** Moving the queen is not a developing move, so I will not do that.
*   **f8e7:** Moving the bishop is not a developing move, so I will not do that.
*   **h7h6:** This is a pawn move, but it doesn't really help me develop.
*   **g7g6:** This is a pawn move, but it doesn't really help me develop.
*   **f7f6:** This is a pawn move, but it doesn't really help me develop.
*   **c7c6:** This is a pawn move, but it doesn't really help me develop.
*   **b7b6:** This is a pawn move, but it doesn't really help me develop.
*   **a7a6:** This is a pawn move, but it doesn't really help me develop.
*   **e5d4:** This is a pawn move, but it doesn't really help me develop.
*   **h7h5:** This is a pawn move, but it doesn't really help me develop.
*   **g7g5:** This is a pawn move, but it doesn't really help me develop.
*   **f7f5:** This is a pawn move, but it doesn't really help me develop.
*   **c7c5:** This is a pawn move, but it doesn't really help me develop.
*   **b7b5:** This is a pawn move, but it doesn't really help me develop.
*   **a7a5:** This is a pawn move, but it doesn't really help me develop.

I think developing the knight to f6 is the best move here. It develops a piece, controls central squares, and prepares for further development.

Okay, I have a lot of options. Let's analyze.

*   **Developing the Queen's Bishop:** ...Bf5 looks interesting, putting pressure on the weak f7 square and controlling important diagonals.
*   **Developing the Knight:** ...Nc6 is a solid developing move, controlling central squares.
*   **Pawn moves:** ...e7 is a bit passive. ...h6, g6, c6, b6, a6 are all okay but don't immediately improve my position. ...h5, g5, c5, b5, a5 are more aggressive but could weaken my pawn structure.

I think ...Bf5 is a good developing move that puts immediate pressure on white.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Okay, that's a lot of moves. Let's analyze them.

*   **King moves:** e8f8, e8e7, e8d7, e8g8 - Moving the king at this stage is risky.
*   **Queen moves:** d8c8, d8e7, d8d7, d8d6 - Developing the queen is premature.
*   **Knight moves:** h8g8, h8f8, b8d7, b8c6, b8a6, f6g8, f6d7, f6h5, f6g4, f6e4 - The knight on f6 is well-placed.
*   **Bishop moves:** c5f8, c5e7, c5d6, c5b6, c5d4, c5b4, c5a3 - The bishop on c5 is also well-placed.
*   **Pawn moves:** h7h6, g7g6, c7c6, b7b6, a7a6, h7h5, g7g5, b7b5, a7a5, e5d4, e5e4 - Pawn moves are important for controlling the center and developing pieces.

I like the idea of developing the knight on f6. The move **...Nf6-e4** attacks the center and opens up the diagonal for the bishop on c5.

Alright, I have a lot of options. Let's analyze the position. White has a strong pawn structure in the center. Black's king is relatively safe. I see a few possibilities:

*   **Developing pieces:** Moving the knight on b8 or the queen on d8.
*   **Pawn moves:** Supporting the pawn structure or challenging white's center.
*   **Attacking the center:** Trying to undermine white's pawn structure.

I think developing the knight to c6 is a solid developing move. It controls important squares and prepares for further development.

That's a lot of moves! Let's analyze the position. White seems to have a slight lead in development. The black king is relatively safe for now. I need to develop my pieces and challenge white's control of the center.

I see a few interesting possibilities.

*   **...d5d4:** This challenges white's pawn on e4 and opens the diagonal for my bishop.
*   **...e8e7:** This develops my queen and prepares to connect my rooks.
*   **...h7h6 or ...g7g6:** These are pawn moves to support the king.

I think developing the queen is a good idea, but ...d5d4 looks more active. Let's go with that.

That's a lot of moves! Let's analyze. White has a strong attack developing, and I need to be careful. The most immediate threat seems to be the white queen and bishop on the seventh rank. I need to develop my pieces and defend my king.

I see a few options:

*   **...Qd7:** This develops the queen, defends the king, and potentially eyes the weak pawn on f7.
*   **...h6:** This prevents a potential white bishop sacrifice on g7.
*   **...g6:** Similar to h6, it prevents a potential white bishop sacrifice.
*   **...e7:** This is a passive move, but it defends the king.

I think ...Qd7 is the most active and promising. It develops a piece, defends the king, and puts pressure on white's position.

Okay, that's a lot of moves. White's threats are clear. The Queen and Bishop on the seventh rank are a major concern. I need to find a move that either defends against these threats or develops a counterattack.

Let's analyze some options:

*   **h8g8, h8f8, e8f8, e8d8, e8e7:** These moves are all king moves. The king is under attack, but moving the king doesn't seem to improve the situation.
*   **a8d8, a8c8, a8b8:** Moving the rook doesn't seem to help much.
*   **d7d8, d7c8, d7e7, d7e6, d7d6, d7d5:** Moving the pawn is not a good idea.
*   **c6d8, c6b8, c6e7, c6e5, c6a5, c6b4:** The knight moves are interesting. **c6e7** could be a good move, blocking the queen's attack and developing a piece.
*   **f5g6, f5e6, f5g4, f5h3:** These moves are not good.
*   **c5f8, c5e7, c5d6, c5b6, c5b4, c5a3:** The bishop moves are not good.
*   **e4f6, e4d6, e4g5, e4g3, e4c3, e4f2, e4d2:** These moves are not good.
*   **e8g8, e8c8:** These moves are not good.
*   **d4c3:** This move is not good.
*   **h7h6, g7g6, f7f6, b7b6, a7a6, d4d3:** These pawn moves are not good.
*   **h7h5, g7g5, b7b5, a7a5:** These pawn moves are not good.

**c6e7** seems like the best move. It blocks the queen's attack on the king and develops the knight.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Okay, that's a lot of moves. Let's analyze the possibilities.

*   **King moves:** Moving the king is generally not a good idea in the opening unless absolutely necessary. e8f8, e8d8, e8g8, e8c8 are not good.
*   **Rook moves:** h8g8, h8f8, a8d8, a8c8, a8b8 are passive.
*   **Queen moves:** d7d8, d7c8, d7e6, d7d6, d7c6, d7d5, d7b5, d7a4. The queen is a valuable piece and should be developed carefully. d7d6 looks like a reasonable developing move, controlling some central squares.
*   **Knight moves:** e7g8, e7c8, e7g6, e7c6, e7d5, f5g6, f5e6, f5g4, f5h3. The knight on f5 is well-placed. e7g6 and e7c6 are interesting, but don't immediately improve the position.
*   **Bishop moves:** c5d6, c5b6, c5b4, c5a3. The bishop on c5 is well-placed. c5d6 is a good developing move.
*   **Pawn moves:** h7h6, g7g6, f7f6, c7c6, b7b6, a7a6, h7h5, g7g5, b7b5, a7a5. Pawn moves are important for controlling the center and supporting pieces.

Considering the position, I think the best move is to develop the queen to d6. This controls important central squares, supports the knight on f5, and prepares for further development.

That's a lot of moves! Let's analyze the position. White has a strong attack developing, and my king is somewhat exposed. I need to prioritize defense and development.

*   **King Safety:** The king on e8 is a bit vulnerable. Moving the rook to f8 or g8 doesn't immediately improve the situation, but it does open up escape routes.
*   **Development:** The knight on e7 is currently blocked. Developing the bishop on c8 is also a priority.
*   **Defense:** White's queen is a threat. I need to consider how to address that.

Considering all of this, I think the best move is to develop the bishop and prepare to defend the king.

You are a professional chess player and you play as black. Now is your turn to make a move. Before making a move you can pick one of the following actions:
- 'get_current_board' to get the schema and current status of the board
- 'get_legal_moves' to get a UCI formatted list of available moves
- 'make_move <UCI formatted move>' when you are ready to complete your turn (e.g., 'make_move e2e4')

Okay, I see the board. White has a strong center with their pawns and queen. Black's king is relatively safe for now, but the open files could become dangerous. I need to develop my pieces and challenge White's control of the center. Let's see what my legal moves are.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Okay, that's a lot of moves! Let's analyze them.

*   **Pawn moves:** `h7h6`, `g7g6`, `f7f6`, `b7b6`, `a7a6`, `h7h5`, `g7g5`, `b7b5`, `d4d3` are mostly pawn moves. Some of these are okay to control space, but I don't want to weaken my pawn structure too much. `d4d3` is interesting, but it opens the d-file for white.
*   **Knight moves:** `e7g8`, `e7c8`, `e7g6`, `e7d5`, `f5c8`, `f5d7`, `f5g6`, `f5e6`, `f5g4`, `f5h3` are knight moves. `f5` is a key square for my knight. `f5e6` looks interesting to challenge the center.
*   **Bishop moves:** `c5b6`, `c5b4`, `c5a3` are bishop moves. The bishop on c5 is well-placed.
*   **Queen moves:** `e4f6`, `e4g5`, `e4g3`, `e4c3`, `e4f2`, `e4d2` are queen moves.
*   **Rook moves:** `a8d8`, `a8c8`, `a8b8`, `h8g8`, `h8f8` are rook moves.
*   **King moves:** `e8f8`, `e8d7`, `e8g8` are king moves.

I'm leaning towards developing my knight and challenging the center. `Nf5e6` looks like a good move. It attacks the center and prepares to challenge White's control.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Okay, that's a lot of moves. Let's analyze. White's queen on d3 is a threat, and I need to address it. I see a few possibilities.

*   **...e7d5:** This challenges the queen directly and opens the diagonal for my bishop.
*   **...e6d5:** This also challenges the queen but might be less effective.
*   **...d6d5:** This also challenges the queen but might be less effective.
*   **...h7h6:** This is a passive move, but it prevents a potential knight jump to g5.
*   **...g7g6:** This is a passive move, but it prevents a potential knight jump to f5.
*   **...f7f6:** This is a passive move, but it prevents a potential knight jump to e5.

I think the most active move is to challenge the queen directly. ...e7d5 seems like the best option.

Okay, I have a lot of options. Let's analyze the position. White has a strong queen on b2 and a potential attack on the kingside. Black needs to develop pieces and defend.

The move ...h7h6 seems like a good prophylactic move to prevent a kingside attack. It also opens up the h-file for the rook.

That's a lot of moves! Let's analyze the position. White seems to have a slight initiative, but the position is complex. I need to find a move that develops my pieces and challenges White's control of the center.

The move ...d5-d4 looks interesting. It attacks the pawn on e4 and opens the diagonal for my bishop on c8. It also challenges White's central pawn structure.

Let's make that move.

You are absolutely right! I apologize for that blunder. I misread the board and the pawn on d5 is already on d4. My apologies.

Let's try again. Looking at the position again, I see that ...g7-g6 is a solid developing move, preparing to fianchetto the bishop on f8. It also prevents any potential attacks on the h6 square.

I see a few options. Moving the rook on h8 to h7 seems passive. Moving the rook on a8 to d8 or c8 looks better. I could also try to develop the queen's bishop. The pawn moves like f7f6 or b7b6 are also possible.

I'll develop my rook to c8 to put pressure on the c-file and potentially connect my rooks.

Considering the king safety and development, I'll move the king to g8.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Okay, I have the legal moves. White is clearly attacking, and I need to defend. Let's analyze some key moves:

*   **...Qe7:** This seems like a reasonable defensive move, developing the queen and defending the king.
*   **...Qf8:** This also defends the king, but might be a bit passive.
*   **...Bg7:** This develops the bishop and defends the king.
*   **...d5:** This challenges the center and opens lines for the queen and bishop.

Considering the position, I think **...Qe7** is the most solid move. It defends the king, develops the queen, and prepares for further defense.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Okay, that's a lot of moves to consider. White has a strong attack, and I need to find a move that defends and creates counterplay.

*   **Defensive considerations:** The immediate threat seems to be the white queen and bishop on the d-file.
*   **Counterplay:** I need to develop my pieces and create some pressure on the white king.

Let's analyze some key moves:

*   **...Qc7:** This seems like a reasonable defensive move, blocking the white queen's attack and potentially developing the queen to a more active position.
*   **...e6f5:** This looks interesting. It attacks the white knight on e4 and opens up the position for my bishop.
*   **...d5f6:** This attacks the white knight and opens the diagonal for my bishop.

Considering the position, I'm leaning towards ...Qc7 as a solid defensive move. It blocks the immediate threat and prepares my queen for future action.

That's a lot of moves! Let's analyze. White's queen is a threat, and I need to develop my pieces and defend. The most pressing issue seems to be the attack on my king. I need to move my king.

Let's see... the king can move to e8, d8, or d7. Moving to e8 doesn't seem to help much. Moving to d8 seems like a good option, as it gets the king out of the immediate attack and opens up the diagonal for the bishop.

So, I will move my king to d8.

*   **...Nf6:** This develops a knight and challenges the center.
*   **...f6:** This supports the e5 pawn and prepares to challenge the center.
*   **...g6:** This stops the white knight from jumping to h5.

Considering the position, I think developing my queen to e7 is the most solid move. It develops a piece, defends a pawn, and prepares for further development.

Alright, I've reviewed the legal moves. The position is complex. White has a strong attack, and I need to defend carefully. I see a few options.

*   **...Qe7:** This develops the queen and defends the e-pawn.
*   **...Nf6:** This develops the knight and controls important central squares.
*   **...f6:** This supports the e-pawn and prepares to challenge white's control of the center.

I think ...Qe7 is the most solid move, developing a piece and defending a key pawn. Let's go with that.

Alright, that's a lot of moves. Let's analyze. The most pressing issue seems to be the threat to my king. The white rook on d4 is a problem. I need to address that. I also need to develop my pieces.

Looking at the moves, I see I can move my rook on c7. Moving it to c8 doesn't seem to help much. Moving the rook on c7 to d7 seems like a good defensive move, protecting the king.

So, I'll move the rook on c7 to d7.

Okay, that's a lot of moves. Let's analyze them.

*   **King moves:** Moving the king is the priority. `g8h8` looks like the best option to get the king out of the immediate attack.
*   **Pawn moves:** Some pawn moves are available, but they don't seem to help the king's safety immediately.
*   **Other piece moves:** The other piece moves don't seem to address the immediate threat to the king.

Therefore, I will move the king to h8.

Okay, I have the legal moves. White is clearly attacking. My king is in danger. I need to find a move that defends the king and ideally develops a piece.

Let's analyze the moves.

*   **h8g8, h8f8, h8e8, h8d8, h8c8, h8b8, h8a8:** Moving the rook doesn't immediately help with the attack.
*   **h8h7:** This also doesn't help much.
*   **e7f8, e7e8, d7d8:** Moving the pawn doesn't help.
*   **d7c7:** This pawn move doesn't seem to do much.
*   **e6f5, e6g4, e6h3:** These moves with the bishop are interesting. Bf5 attacks the white knight.
*   **d6b8, d6c7, d6e5:** These moves with the queen are not good.
*   **d5c7, d5f6, d5b6, d5f4, d5b4, d5e3, d5c3:** These moves with the queen are not good.
*   **c5b6, c5b4, c5a3:** These moves with the pawn are not good.
*   **e4f6, e4g5, e4g3, e4c3, e4f2, e4d2:** These moves with the knight are not good.
*   **d4e3:** This pawn move doesn't seem to do much.
*   **f7f6, b7b6, a7a6, h6h5, g6g5, d4d3, f7f5, b7b5:** These pawn moves don't help.

The best move seems to be **e6f5**. This attacks the white knight and develops the bishop. It also opens a line for the queen to defend the king.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Okay, I've got a lot of options. Let's analyze them:

*   **Pawn moves:** `h8h7`, `e7e6`, `f7f6`, `b7b6`, `a7a6`, `h6h5`, `g6g5`, `b7b5` These are mostly defensive and don't immediately improve my position. `e7e6` looks reasonable to support the king.
*   **Rook moves:** `h8g8`, `h8f8`, `h8e8`, `h8d8`, `h8c8`, `h8b8`, `h8a8` These moves don't seem to help much right now.
*   **Queen moves:** `d6b8`, `d6c7`, `d6f6`, `d6e6`, `d6e5`, `d6f4`, `d6b6`, `d6c3` The queen is under attack, and I need to move it. `d6e5` looks interesting, attacking the knight and opening the diagonal for the bishop.
*   **Bishop moves:** `f5e6`, `f5g4`, `f5h3`, `d5c7`, `d5f6`, `d5b6`, `d5f4`, `d5b4`, `d5e3`, `d5c3` These moves don't seem to have immediate impact.
*   **Pawn moves:** `c5b6`, `c5d4`, `c5b4`, `c5a3` These moves don't seem to help much right now.
*   **Knight moves:** `e4f6`, `e4g5`, `e4g3`, `e4c3`, `e4f2`, `e4d2` These moves don't seem to help much right now.

Considering the threats and the need to develop, I think the best move is to move the queen to `d6e5`. This attacks the knight, opens the diagonal for the bishop, and gets the queen out of the immediate line of fire.

*   **e7f8, e7e8, e7f6, e7e6, e7d6:** Moving the pawn doesn't help.

*   **f5e6, f5g4, f5e4, f5h3:** The bishop moves are interesting, but don't directly address the threat.
*   **e5b8, e5g7, e5c7, e5f6, e5e6, e5d6, e5f4, e5e4, e5d4:** The queen moves are the most promising. Capturing the rook with Qxd4 seems like the best option.
*   **d5c7, d5f6, d5b6, d5f4, d5b4, d5e3, d5c3:** The bishop moves don't help.
*   **c5d6, c5b6, c5d4, c5b4, c5a3:** The bishop moves don't help.
*   **f7f6, b7b6, a7a6, h6h5, g6g5, b7b5:** Pawn moves don't help.

The best move seems to be to capture the rook with the queen.

Okay, I see the board. White has a strong attack developing. My king is a bit exposed. I need to defend and develop my pieces. Let's get the legal moves.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Okay, I have a lot of options. Let's analyze them.

*   **Rook moves:** Moving the rook on h8 doesn't seem immediately helpful.
*   **Pawn moves:** Pushing the e pawn (e7e6) looks like a good developing move. It challenges the center and opens a diagonal for the bishop.
*   **Bishop moves:** The bishop on c5 has some interesting options, but none seem immediately critical.
*   **Knight moves:** The knight on d4 has a lot of options, but none immediately threaten anything.
*   **Pawn moves:** Pushing the f pawn (f7f6) would block the bishop on c5.
*   **Pawn moves:** Pushing the b pawn (b7b6) is a standard developing move.
*   **Pawn moves:** Pushing the a pawn (a7a6) is a standard developing move.
*   **Pawn moves:** Pushing the h pawn (h6h5) is a standard developing move.
*   **Pawn moves:** Pushing the g pawn (g6g5) is a standard developing move.
*   **Pawn moves:** Pushing the b pawn (b7b5) is a standard developing move.

I think the most solid move is to develop the e pawn.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Okay, I have a list of legal moves. White is threatening a checkmate, so I need to be very careful.

Let's analyze the options.

*   **Rook moves:** Moving the rook on h8 doesn't seem to help much in the immediate situation.
*   **Pawn moves:** Pushing the pawns on f7, b7, a7, h6, and g6 doesn't seem to solve the immediate problems.
*   **e7f8, e7e8:** Moving the king is not a good idea.
*   **e7f6, e7d6:** These moves don't help.
*   **d7d8, d7c7, d7d6:** These moves don't help.
*   **d5c7, d5f6, d5b6, d5f4, d5b4, d5e3, d5c3:** The bishop moves are not helpful.
*   **c5d6, c5b6, c5b4, c5a3:** The bishop moves are not helpful.
*   **d4g7, d4f6, d4e5, d4f4, d4e4, d4c4, d4e3, d4d3, d4c3, d4f2, d4b2, d4g1:** The queen moves are not helpful.
*   **g6f5, f7f6, b7b6, a7a6, h6h5, g6g5, b7b5:** Pushing the pawns doesn't help.

I need to find a move that defends the king and develops a piece. The most pressing threat seems to be from the white queen. Moving the pawn on f7 to f6 seems like the best move.

*   **Piece development:** Moving the rook on d8 doesn't seem to help.

The most critical threat is the potential checkmate. I need to find a move that defends against this.

Looking at the moves, ...d6 seems like the best option. It blocks the potential check from the white queen.

Therefore, I will play d7d6.

Alright, I've got a good list of moves. Let's analyze them.

*   **Rook moves (h8):** The rook on h8 has a lot of options, but most of them don't seem immediately impactful. Moving it to h7 might be useful later.
*   **Pawn moves (e7, b7, a7, h6, g6):** The pawn moves look more promising.
    *   `e7f8` is a promotion, but it's not a good idea since the king is exposed.
    *   `b7b6` and `a7a6` are standard pawn moves, but don't immediately change the position.
    *   `h6h5` seems like a good idea to challenge white's control of the h-file.
    *   `g6g5` is a good move to challenge white's control of the g-file.
    *   `b7b5` is a good move to challenge white's control of the b-file.
*   **Pawn moves (c5, d4):** The pawn moves look more promising.
    *   `c5b6` and `c5b4` are standard pawn moves, but don't immediately change the position.
    *   `d4e5` is a good move to challenge white's control of the e-file.
    *   `d4f4` is a good move to challenge white's control of the f-file.
    *   `d4e4` is a good move to challenge white's control of the e-file.
    *   `d4c4` is a good move to challenge white's control of the c-file.
    *   `d4e3` is a good move to challenge white's control of the e-file.
    *   `d4d3` is a good move to challenge white's control of the d-file.
    *   `d4c3` is a good move to challenge white's control of the c-file.
    *   `d4f2` is a good move to challenge white's control of the f-file.
    *   `d4d2` is a good move to challenge white's control of the d-file.
    *   `d4g1` is a good move to challenge white's control of the g-file.
    *   `d4d1` is a good move to challenge white's control of the d-file.
*   **Knight moves (d5):** The knight on d5 has a lot of options, but most of them don't seem immediately impactful.
*   **Bishop moves (c4):** The bishop on c4 has a lot of options, but most of them don't seem immediately impactful.

I think the best move here is to challenge white's control of the g-file with `g6g5`.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, that's a lot to consider. The immediate threat is the exposed king. I need to prioritize its safety. Let's analyze the moves.

*   **King moves:** `h8g8, h8f8, h8e8, h8d8, h8c8, h8b8, h8a8, h8h7` - Moving the rook doesn't help the king.
*   **Pawn moves:** `e7f8, e7e8, e7f7, d6d8, d6d7, d6e6, c5b6, c5b4, c5a3, b7b6, a7a6, h6h5, g5g4, b7b5` - These pawn moves don't directly address the king's safety.
*   **Bishop moves:** `d5c7, d5b6, d5f4, d5b4, d5e3, d5c3` - The bishop moves don't immediately help the king.
*   **Rook moves:** `d4e5, d4f4, d4e4, d4c4, d4e3, d4d3, d4c3, d4f2, d4d2, d4g1, d4d1` - These rook moves don't immediately help the king.
*   **Pawn moves:** `g5h4, g5f4` - These pawn moves don't immediately help the king.

The most pressing concern is the king's safety. I need to move the rook to protect the king. The move `h8h7` looks like the best option.

Okay, I have a lot of options. Let's analyze the position. White's king is exposed, and I have a few pieces that can attack it. The most immediate threat seems to be the pawn on d4. I can attack it with my bishop. I also need to consider the long-term implications of my moves.

I'll play ...Bf8, attacking the pawn on d4 and developing my bishop.

*   **h7h8=Q** is tempting, but it doesn't address the immediate threats.
*   **e7e6** is a good defensive move, blocking the queen's diagonal.
*   **d4d5** is also a good option.

I think **e7e6** is the most solid move. It defends against the immediate threats and prepares for further development.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Okay, I've reviewed the legal moves. White is threatening a checkmate. I need to prioritize defending my king. The most pressing threat seems to be the potential for a checkmate on the h-file. I see a few options to address this:

*   **h7h8=Q:** Promoting the pawn to a queen is tempting, but it doesn't immediately solve the problem.
*   **h7g7:** This blocks the h-file, but it doesn't develop any pieces.
*   **h7f7:** This also blocks the h-file, but it doesn't develop any pieces.
*   **d4d3:** This move seems to be the best option. It blocks the checkmate threat and develops a piece.

Therefore, I will make the move d4d3.

Alright, that's a lot of moves. Let's analyze them.

*   **Pawn moves:** `h7h8, h7g7, h7f7, h7e7, h7d7, h7c7, e6f7, e6e7, e6d7, e6d6, e6f5, d5d8, d5d7, d5d6, d5f5, d5e5, d5d4, d5d3, g5h4, g5f4, b7b6, a7a6, h6h5, f6f5, g5g4, b7b5` - Many pawn moves. Some are defensive, some try to develop.
*   **Bishop moves:** `c5f8, c5e7, c5d6, c5b6, c5d4, c5b4, c5e3, c5a3, c5f2, c5g1` - The bishop on c5 has a lot of options.

My priority is to defend my king and develop my pieces. The pawn on h7 is under attack, so I need to move it. Moving it to h8 and promoting it to a queen looks tempting, but it's not the best move in this position. Moving the pawn to h6 looks like a good defensive move.

I'll make the move `h6h5`.

Alright, I've got a lot of options. Let's break this down.

*   **Pawn moves:** I have pawn moves on the h, e, and b files. The h-pawn can promote, but it doesn't seem immediately helpful. The e-pawn can move, but it doesn't seem to improve the position. The b-pawn can move, but it doesn't seem to help either.
*   **Bishop moves:** The bishop on c5 has a lot of options, but none of them seem to immediately address the threat.
*   **Pawn moves:** The pawn on f6 can move.
*   **Other moves:** The pawn on d5 has a lot of options.

The most pressing issue is the attack on my king. I need to find a way to defend. The rook on d4 is a serious threat.

Let's consider the move **d5d4**. This move blocks the rook's attack on my king.

Okay, I see the board. Black's king is in a potentially vulnerable position. White has a strong attack developing. I need to find a move that addresses the immediate threats and improves my position. Let's get the legal moves.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Okay, I have a list of legal moves. Let's analyze them.

*   **Pawn moves (h7h8, h7g7, h7f7, h7e7, h7d7, h7c7, h7h6):** Pushing the h-pawn doesn't seem to help much.
*   **Pawn moves (e6f7, e6e7, e6d7, e6d6):** Moving the pawn on e6 doesn't seem to improve the position significantly.
*   **Bishop moves (c5f8, c5e7, c5d6, c5b6, c5b4, c5a3):** The bishop on c5 is a key piece. Moving it to f8 would be a bad trade, and the other moves don't seem to help.
*   **Rook moves (d4d8, d4d7, d4d6, d4d5, d4f4, d4e4, d4c4, d4d3):** The rook on d4 is important for defense. Moving it to d8 is not a good idea. Moving it to d5, d6, or d7 doesn't seem to help. Moving it to f4, e4, or c4 could be interesting, but it doesn't address the immediate threats.
*   **Pawn moves (f6g5):** This move doesn't seem to help.
*   **Pawn moves (b7b6, a7a6, b7b5):** These moves don't seem to help.
*   **Pawn moves (f6f5):** This move doesn't seem to help.

After reviewing the moves, I think the best move is to move the rook on d4 to d5. This puts pressure on the d-file and potentially defends against a white attack.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, I have a lot of options. Let's analyze them.

*   **Pawn moves:** `h7h8, h7g7, h7f7, h7e7, h7d7, h7c7, h7h6, e6e7, e6d6, d5d8, d5d7, d5d6, d5e5, d5d4, d5d3, d5d2, d5d1, b7b6, a7a6, f6g5, f6e5, b7b5, f6f5` The pawn moves on h7 are interesting, but I don't want to promote the pawn just yet. The pawn on e6 doesn't seem to have a good immediate purpose. The pawn on d5 can be used to attack the center. The pawn on f6 can be used to attack the center. The pawns on b7 and a7 are not very important right now.

*   **Bishop moves:** `c5f8, c5e7, c5d6, c5b6, c5d4, c5b4, c5e3, c5a3, c5f2, c5g1` The bishop on c5 has a lot of options. I think the bishop on c5 can be used to attack the white king.

Considering the position, I think the best move is to develop my bishop to attack the white king.

*   **Bishop moves:** The bishop on f2 has several diagonals.
*   **Other pieces:**

Looking at the position, white's king is exposed. I need to consider how to attack it. The pawn on h7 can promote to a queen, which would be a check. I'll promote the h-pawn to a queen.

Okay, I've got a lot of options. Let's analyze.

*   **Pawn Moves:** The pawns on h7, e6, and b7 have several moves. The h-pawn can promote, but it's not immediately advantageous. The e-pawn has a few options, but none seem particularly strong. The b-pawn can advance.
*   **Bishop Moves:** The bishop on f2 has a wide range of moves, but none seem to immediately threaten anything.
*   **King Moves:** The king is relatively safe for now.
*   **Other Moves:** The pawn on d5 has many moves, but none seem to be particularly good.

Considering the position, I think the most active move is to advance the b-pawn. This challenges the center and opens up a potential diagonal for the bishop.

Alright, I've got a list of legal moves. Let's analyze the position and the available moves.

*   **Pawn Moves:** h7h8, h7g7, h7f7, h7e7, h7d7, h7c7, h7b7, h7h6, e6f7, e6d7, e6d6, d5d8, d5d7, d5d6, d5g5, d5f5, d5e5, d5c5, d5d4, d5d3, f6g5, a7a6, f6f5, c6c5, b5b4. The pawn moves are numerous, and some are quite interesting. The pawn on d5 is particularly important as it is attacking the white rook on d4.

*   **Knight Moves:** f2b6, f2c5, f2h4, f2d4, f2g3, f2e3, f2g1, f2e1, b5c4, b5a4. The knight on f2 has a lot of options, but none seem immediately critical. The knight on b5 has fewer options.

Considering the position, I think the most pressing issue is the attack on the rook on d4. I also want to develop my pieces and control the center.

I'm going to move the pawn on d5 to d4, attacking the rook.

Okay, I see the board. White has a strong attack developing, and my king is somewhat exposed. I need to find a move that addresses the immediate threats and improves my position. Let's get a list of legal moves.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Okay, I have the legal moves. White's rook on d4 is a threat, and I need to address it. Moving the pawn on h7 is not a good idea. The pawn on f6 can move to f5 or g5. The pawn on c6 can move to c5 or b5. The pawn on e6 can move to d7, d6, or f7.

Looking at the position more closely, I see that if I move the pawn on c6 to c5, I can potentially open the c-file and create some counterplay. Also, I need to protect my king.

Let's try `c6c5`.

Okay, I have the legal moves. Let's analyze them.

*   **h7h8, h7g7, h7f7, h7e7, h7d7, h7c7, h7b7, h7h6:** These are pawn moves. Pushing the h-pawn doesn't seem to help much.
*   **e6f7, e6d7, e6d6:** These are pawn moves.
*   **d4d8, d4d7, d4d6, d4d5, d4f4, d4e4, d4c4, d4b4, d4a4, d4d3, d4d2, d4d1:** This is the queen. Moving the queen is risky right now, as it could be attacked easily.
*   **f2g3, f2e3, f2g1, f2e1:** These are pawn moves.
*   **f6g5:** Moving the knight to g5 looks interesting. It attacks the white rook on h7 and potentially opens lines for the black king to escape.
*   **a7a6:** This is a pawn move.
*   **f6f5:** This is a pawn move.
*   **c5c4:** This is a pawn move.

The best move seems to be **f6g5**. It develops the knight, attacks a rook, and potentially improves the king's safety.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Okay, I have a lot of options. Let's analyze a bit.

*   **h7h8=Q, h7h8=R, h7h8=B, h7h8=N:** Promoting the pawn to a queen is tempting, but it doesn't immediately solve any problems and might even create new ones. Rook, Bishop and Knight are not good options.
*   **e6f7, e6d7, e6f6, e6f5, e6d5:** Moving the knight doesn't seem to help much.
*   **d4d8, d4d7, d4d6, d4d5, d4f4, d4e4, d4c4, d4b4, d4a4, d4d3, d4d2, d4d1:** The queen is under attack. Moving the queen is important.
*   **f2g3, f2e3, f2g1, f2e1:** Moving the bishop is not good.
*   **g5h4, g5f4:** Moving the pawn is not good.
*   **a7a6, a7a5:** Moving the pawn is not good.
*   **g5g4, c5c4:** Moving the pawns is not good.

The most pressing issue is the attack on my queen. I need to move it. The most active square seems to be to d7.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, I've got the legal moves. Let's analyze them.

*   **Pawn moves:** h7h8, h7g7, h7f7, h7e7, h7h6, d7d8, d7g7, d7f7, d7e7, d7c7, d7d6, d7d5, d7d4, g5h4, g5f4, c5d4, a7a6, g5g4, c5c4, a7a5. Many pawn moves are available. The pawn on h7 can promote, but that doesn't seem immediately helpful. The pawn on d7 is pinned by the white queen. The pawn on g5 can move forward. The pawn on c5 can move forward. The pawn on a7 can move forward.
*   **Knight moves:** e6f7, e6f5. The knight on e6 can move to f7 or f5.
*   **Bishop moves:** None. The bishop on f8 is blocked.
*   **Rook moves:** None. The rooks are blocked.
*   **King moves:** None. The king is trapped.
*   **Queen moves:** None.

The most pressing issue is the threat to the pawn on c7. Moving the knight to f5 (e6f5) seems like a good defensive move, attacking the white queen and protecting the pawn on c7.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Okay, I've got a lot of options. Let's analyze them.

*   **Pawn moves:** `h7h8`, `h7g7`, `h7f7`, `h7e7`, `h7h6`, `d7d8`, `d7g7`, `d7f7`, `d7e7`, `d7c7`, `d7d6`, `g5h4`, `g5f4`, `a7a6`, `g5g4`, `c5c4`, `a7a5`. These are all standard pawn moves. Some promote, some attack.
*   **Bishop moves:** `f5e4`, `f2d4`, `f2g3`, `f2e3`, `f2g1`, `f2e1`. The bishop on f5 has some interesting diagonal options. The bishop on f2 is blocked.

Now, let's think about the strategic implications. White's king is vulnerable. I need to prioritize moves that attack the king or create threats.

*   **h7h6**: This doesn't immediately threaten anything.
*   **d7d6**: This doesn't immediately threaten anything.
*   **g5g4**: This doesn't immediately threaten anything.
*   **c5c4**: This doesn't immediately threaten anything.
*   **f5e4**: This attacks a pawn.
*   **f5g4**: This attacks the king.

I think the most promising move is to attack the king directly.

You are absolutely right! I made a mistake. The move f5g4 is illegal because the g4 square is occupied by a pawn. I need to be more careful. Let's re-evaluate.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Okay, I have the legal moves again. Let's re-analyze, keeping in mind the illegal move I just tried.

*   **Pawn moves:** `h7h8`, `h7g7`, `h7f7`, `h7e7`, `h7h6`, `d7d8`, `d7g7`, `d7f7`, `d7e7`, `d7c7`, `d7d6`, `g5h4`, `g5f4`, `a7a6`, `g5g4`, `c5c4`, `a7a5`.
*   **Bishop moves:** `f5e4`, `f2d4`, `f2g3`, `f2e3`, `f2g1`, `f2e1`.

The bishop on f5 can attack the pawn on e4. This doesn't immediately threaten the king, but it opens up the position.

The pawn moves don't seem to immediately threaten the king.

I'm going to try to open up the position and attack the pawn.

You are a professional chess player and you play as black. Now is your turn to make a move. Before making a move you can pick one of the following actions:
- 'get_current_board' to get the schema and current status of the board
- 'get_legal_moves' to get a UCI formatted list of available moves
- 'make_move <UCI formatted move>' when you are ready to complete your turn (e.g., 'make_move e2e4')

The move e4d4 is a capture of the white rook on d4 with the black queen. This seems like a good tactical opportunity.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, I have a lot of options. Let's analyze them:

*   **Pawn moves:** `h7h8,h7g7,h7f7,h7e7,h7d7,h7c7,h7h6,d5d8,d5d7,d5d6,f2h4,f2g3,f2e3,f2g1,f2e1,g5h4,g5f4,a7a6,g5g4,c5c4,a7a5` - These are all pawn moves. Some look immediately bad (like promoting the h-pawn to a queen and giving up the rook).

Considering the board, I need to address the immediate threats. White's queen on e5 is a problem. I also need to consider the position of my king.

The best move here seems to be to challenge the queen and develop a piece. I think `d5e5` is a good option.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, I've got a lot of options. Let's analyze them.

*   **Pawn moves:** I have a lot of pawn moves available. The h-pawn has several options for moving forward, but none of them seem immediately advantageous. The e-pawn has many options, but advancing it too far could open up the position for white's queen. The g-pawn and c-pawn also have options.
*   **Other moves:** I have some knight moves, but they don't seem to immediately improve my position.

The most interesting moves seem to be the pawn moves. The e-pawn could be used to attack the white king. However, I think I should focus on developing my pieces and controlling the center. I'll move the c-pawn to control the center.

*   **Pawn moves:** h7h6, a7a6, a7a5. These are standard pawn moves, but don't immediately improve the position.
*   **King moves:** d5c5, d5e4, d5e6, d5c4. The king is currently somewhat exposed. Moving it to c4 looks like a reasonable defensive option.
*   **Queen moves:** g5h4, g5f4. The queen is currently attacking the pawn on f5 and is also under attack by the white rook. Moving the queen to f4 seems like a good idea to defend the pawn on f7.
*   **Knight moves:** g8f6, g8h6. The knight on g8 is currently blocked. Moving it to f6 is a good developing move.
*   **Rook moves:** h8h6, h8h7. The rook is currently blocked.
*   **Bishop moves:** c8d7, c8b7, c8a6. The bishop is currently blocked.

Considering the position, I think the best move is to develop the knight to f6 and defend the f7 pawn.

*   **Pawn moves:** a7a6, a7a5, h7h6. These are standard pawn moves.
*   **King moves:** d5c4, d5c5, d5e4, d5e6. The king is somewhat exposed. c4 looks like a good defensive option.
*   **Queen moves:** g5f4, g5h4. The queen is under attack. f4 defends the pawn on f7.
*   **Rook moves:** h8h6, h8h7. The rook is blocked.
*   **Bishop moves:** c8b7, c8a6, c8d7. The bishop is blocked.

The most pressing issue is the attack on the queen. Moving the queen to f4 seems like the most logical move, defending the f7 pawn and getting the queen out of the immediate attack.

Okay, I see the board. White has a knight on h8, a bishop on c7, and a rook on h7. Black has pawns on a7, d5, f5, and a rook on e4, a queen on g5, and a bishop on g7. White's king is on f2, and black's king is on d3.

Now, I need to see my legal moves.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Okay, I have a list of legal moves. Let's analyze them.

*   **Rook moves (h7):** The rook on h7 has a lot of options. However, moving the rook doesn't seem to immediately improve my position.
*   **Pawn moves (e5):** The pawn on e5 is not on the board
*   **King moves (d3):** The king has a few options, but none seem particularly advantageous.
*   **Pawn moves (h5):** The pawn on h5 is not on the board
*   **Pawn moves (c4):** The pawn on c4 is not on the board
*   **Pawn moves (a7):** Pushing the a-pawn to a6 or a5 doesn't seem to achieve much.
*   **Pawn moves (f4):** The pawn on f4 is not on the board

My rook on e4 is currently under attack by the white knight on h8. I need to address this threat. Moving the rook seems like the most logical option. I can move the rook to e3, attacking the white king.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

You are absolutely right! I made a mistake. The rook is on e4, and I can't move it to e3 because that square is occupied by the black king. I need to be more careful.

Let's re-evaluate. The rook on e4 is under attack by the white knight on h8. I need to move the rook to safety. The rook can move to e5, e6, e7, or e8. Moving to e5 attacks the white queen.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

I am making a lot of mistakes! The rook is on e4, and the pawn on e5 is blocking the rook. I need to think more carefully.

The rook on e4 is under attack by the knight on h8. I need to move the rook. The rook can move to e1, e2, e3, e5, e6, e7, or e8. Moving to e1, e2, or e3 doesn't seem to accomplish much. Moving to e5 attacks the white queen, which is the best option.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, I have a good number of options. Let's analyze them.

*   **Pawn moves:** Pushing pawns is generally good for controlling the center and developing pieces. `h7h6`, `g7g6`, `f7f6`, `d7d6`, `c7c6`, `b7b6`, `a7a6` are all solid, but don't immediately create any threats. `h7h5`, `g7g5`, `f7f5`, `d7d5`, `c7c5`, `b7b5`, `a7a5` are more aggressive, but could weaken my pawn structure.
*   **Knight moves:** `g8e7`, `g8h6`, `g8f6`, `b8c6`, `b8a6` are all developing moves. `g8f6` looks like a good developing move, aiming for the center.
*   **Bishop moves:** `f8e7`, `f8d6`, `f8c5`, `f8b4` are all developing moves. `f8e7` is a solid developing move.
*   **Queen moves:** `d8e7`, `d8f6`, `d8g5`, `d8h4` are all developing moves.
*   **King moves:** `e8e7` is a possibility, but not a priority at this stage.

Considering the position, I want to develop a piece and control the center. I think developing the knight to f6 is a good choice.

Okay, I have the legal moves. Let's analyze the position. White has developed a pawn to e4, and I need to react. I see a few options.

*   **...h6, ...g6, ...d6, ...c6, ...b6, ...a6:** These are standard pawn moves to control the center and prepare for development. They are solid but don't immediately challenge White.
*   **...h5, ...g5, ...d5, ...c5, ...b5, ...a5:** These are more aggressive pawn moves, aiming to challenge White's control of the center.
*   **...Bg7:** Developing the bishop is a good idea.
*   **...Qe7:** Developing the queen is also a good idea.
*   **...Nc6:** Developing the knight is a good idea.
*   **...Nf6:** Developing the knight is a good idea.
*   **...Be7:** Developing the bishop is a good idea.
*   **...Ke7:** Moving the king is a good idea.

I think I'll develop a piece and challenge the center. I'll play ...Nf6.

Alright, I have a good list of moves. Let's consider a few options.

*   **Developing the Queen's Bishop:** Moves like ...Bf6 or ...Be7 look tempting, developing a piece and controlling some central squares.
*   **Pawn Structure:** ...h6 or ...g6 are standard moves to prevent white's knights from occupying those squares.
*   **Pawn Advances:** ...d5 or ...e5 could challenge white's center.

I think I'll start by developing my Queen's Bishop to f6. It develops a piece, eyes the center, and prepares for potential kingside activity.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Okay, I have the list of legal moves. The position is complex, and I need to consider several factors. Black's king is relatively exposed. White has a strong pawn structure in the center. I need to develop my pieces and try to create some counterplay.

Let's consider a few options:

*   **...h7-h6:** This is a solid move, preventing any potential back-rank threats and preparing for further pawn advances.
*   **...b8-c6:** Develops the knight, controlling important central squares.
*   **...f8-e7:** Develops the bishop, preparing to control the long diagonal.
*   **...e8-e7:** This move protects the king and prepares for further development.

I think developing the knight to c6 is a good developing move.

h8g8,f8e7,f8d6,f8c5,f8b4,e8e7,e8d7,d8c8,d8b8,d8e7,d8d7,d8d6,a8c8,a8b8,f6g8,f6d7,f6h5,f6g4,f6e4,c6b8,c6e7,c6a5,c6d4,c6b4,f5c8,f5d7,f5g6,f5e6,f5g4,f5e4,f5h3,f5d3,f5c2,f5b1,e5f4,e5d4,d5c4,h7h6,g7g6,b7b6,a7a6,e5e4,h7h5,g7g5,b7b5,a7a5

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, I have a lot of options. White's attack is a concern, so I need to develop and defend. Let's analyze a few possibilities:

*   **Developing the Queen's Bishop (f8):** Moves like f8e7, f8d6, f8c5, f8b4 look interesting. They develop the bishop and potentially put pressure on the long diagonal.
*   **Developing the King's Bishop (f5):** Moves like f5e6, f5g4, f5e4, f5d3, f5c2, f5b1 are available.
*   **Pawn moves:** h7h6, g7g6, b7b6, a7a6, h7h5, g7g5, b7b5, a7a5 are all standard pawn moves.
*   **King moves:** e8e7, e8d7, are available.
*   **Rook moves:** a8c8, a8b8 are available.
*   **Knight moves:** f6g8, f6d7, f6h5, f6g4, f6e4, c6b8, c6e7, c6a5, c6d4, c6b4 are available.

Considering the position, I think developing the Queen's Bishop to e7 is a good developing move that also defends against a potential attack.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Okay, that's a lot of moves. Let's analyze the most promising ones.

*   **Defensive moves:** `e8f8` or `e8d7` move the king, but they don't really improve the position and might allow White to continue the attack.
*   **Development:** `h8g8`, `a8c8`, `a8b8` develop the rooks, but they don't address the immediate threats.
*   **Knight moves:** `f6g8`, `f6d7`, `f6h5`, `f6g4`, `f6e4`, `c6b8`, `c6a5`, `c6d4`, `c6b4` are possible knight moves. Some of these look interesting.
*   **Pawn moves:** `h7h6`, `g7g6`, `b7b6`, `a7a6`, `h7h5`, `g7g5`, `b7b5`, `a7a5` are pawn moves that don't seem to help much.
*   **Bishop moves:** `f5c8`, `f5d7`, `f5g6`, `f5e6`, `f5g4`, `f5e4`, `f5h3`, `f5d3`, `f5c2`, `f5b1` are bishop moves.

The most critical threat seems to be the potential attack on the king. I need to find a move that improves the king's safety and develops a piece.

I'm leaning towards developing the knight to a square where it can defend the king and potentially attack. `Nf6-d7` looks like a good option. It defends the king and prepares to challenge the center.

My apologies. I made a mistake. The board is not the starting position. I missed the knight on f4. Let me re-evaluate.

Okay, the knight on f4 is a threat. I need to address it. I'll play ...d5 to challenge the center and develop a pawn.

Alright, I have a lot of options. I want to develop a piece and control the center.

*   **...Nf6** is a standard developing move, controlling important central squares.
*   **...e6** supports the d5 pawn and prepares to develop the light-squared bishop.
*   **...d6** is another option to support the center.

I think I'll go with the most common and solid developing move.

*   **...h7-h6** and **...g7-g6** are standard pawn moves to support the kingside and prepare for piece development.
*   **...Nf6-d7** looks like a good developing move, getting the knight off the back rank.
*   **...Bf8-e7** is another good developing move, preparing to control the long diagonal.
*   **...Qd8-e7** is a possibility, but I'd prefer to develop the other pieces first.

I think I'll start with developing my knight.

*   **g8f6 (Knight to f6):** This is a standard developing move, controlling central squares and preparing for further development.
*   **e7f6 (Pawn to f6):** This supports the knight and opens the diagonal for the bishop.
*   **d7f6 (Pawn to f6):** This supports the knight and opens the diagonal for the bishop.
*   **g7g6 (Pawn to g6):** This is a solid move, supporting the knight and preparing for the bishop to develop.
*   **c7c6 (Pawn to c6):** This supports the pawn on d7 and prepares to develop the bishop.
*   **b7b6 (Pawn to b6):** This supports the pawn on a7 and prepares to develop the bishop.
*   **a7a6 (Pawn to a6):** This supports the pawn on b7.
*   **e7d6 (Pawn to d6):** This supports the knight and opens the diagonal for the bishop.

I like the idea of developing my knight to f6. It controls important central squares and prepares for further development. I'll go with that.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, I've got a lot of options. Let's analyze them.

*   **King moves:** `h8g8, h8f8, e8f8, e8g8` - The king is relatively safe for now.
*   **Rook moves:** `a8b8` - Not much happening with the rooks at the moment.
*   **Queen moves:** `e7f8, e7d6, e7c5, e7b4, e7a3` - The queen has some interesting diagonals.
*   **Knight moves:** `f6g8, f6h5, f6d5, f6g4, f6e4` - The knight is well-placed and has some good options.
*   **Pawn moves:** `g7h6, g7g6, c7c6, b7b6, a7a6, e5e4, g7g5, c7c5, b7b5, a7a5` - Pawn moves are standard.

The most interesting options seem to be developing the queen or maneuvering the knight. The knight on f6 is well-placed, and I want to develop it further. I like the idea of putting pressure on the center.

I'll play `f6d5`. This develops the knight to a central square, attacks the pawn on e3, and prepares for further development.

You are a professional chess player and you play as black. Now is your turn to make a move. Before making a move you can pick one of the following actions:
- 'get_current_board' to get the schema and current status of the board
- 'get_legal_moves' to get a UCI formatted list of available moves
- 'make_move <UCI formatted move>' when you are ready to complete your turn (e.g., 'make_move e2e4')

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Okay, there are a lot of options. Let's consider the position. White's queen is active, and the black king is somewhat exposed. I need to develop my pieces and try to control the center.

The move ...e7e6 looks like a good developing move. It supports the pawn on d5, prepares to develop the bishop, and doesn't block the queen.

Let's make the move.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

My apologies, I made a mistake. Let's try again. I see that e7e6 is not a legal move. I must have misread the board.

Let's try ...h7h6. This supports the g7 pawn and prepares to develop the rook.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Okay, I'm clearly having trouble reading the legal moves. Let's try another approach. I'll focus on developing a piece. The knight on d5 is well-placed, so let's develop the bishop on f8. I'll try ...Bf8e7.

Okay, I have the legal moves. Let's analyze them.

*   **Pawn moves:** a7-a6, a7-a5, b7-b6, b7-b5, d7-d6, d7-d5, e7-e6, e7-e5, f7-f6, f7-f5, g7-g6, g7-g5, h7-h6, h7-h5. These are all standard pawn moves.
*   **Knight moves:** b8-c6, b8-a6. The knight can develop to either c6 or a6.
*   **Queen moves:** d8-c7, d8-b6, d8-a5. The queen has a few developing options.
*   **Rook moves:** h8-g8. The rook can move to g8.

Considering the position, I want to develop a piece and control the center. The knight move to c6 looks good, controlling important squares. I'll play ...Nc6.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Okay, I have a list of legal moves. The most pressing issue is to develop my pieces and challenge white's center. The knight on c6 is well-placed, but I need to get my queen and rooks involved.

*   **...e7e6** seems like a solid developing move, supporting the pawn on d7 and preparing to develop the queen.
*   **...h7h6** and **...g7g6** are also reasonable, preparing for the development of the rooks and potentially the bishop on f8.
*   **...c5c4** is tempting to challenge the center, but it might weaken my pawn structure too early.

I'll choose a solid developing move that also prepares for future development.

Okay, I've got a list of legal moves. Let's analyze the position. Black's king is relatively safe for now. White has a strong center. I need to develop my pieces and challenge White's control of the center. The move ...e6e5 looks interesting. It challenges the center, opens lines for my queen and bishop, and prepares for further development.

Therefore, I will make the move ...e6e5.

Okay, I have a lot of options. Let's analyze the position. White has a strong attack potential with their Queen and Bishop on the open files. Black needs to develop and defend.

*   **Developing the Bishop:** `f8e7` looks like a good developing move, getting the bishop active.
*   **Pawn Structure:** Pushing pawns like `h7h6` or `g7g6` can help solidify the pawn structure, but might weaken the kingside.
*   **Queen's safety:** The queen is currently exposed.

Considering the need for development and defense, I'll choose `f8e7`.

h8g8,h8f8,e8f8,e8d8,a8b8,e7f8,e7d8,e7f6,e7d6,e7g5,e7h4,c6d8,c6b8,c6a5,c6d4,c6b4,b6d8,b6c7,b6a6,b6b5,b6a5,b6b4,b6b3,e4f6,e4d6,e4g5,e4g3,e4c3,e4f2,e4d2,e8g8,h7h6,g7g6,f7f6,d7d6,a7a6,c5c4,h7h5,g7g5,f7f5,d7d5,a7a5

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, that's a lot of moves. Let's analyze them.

*   **King moves:** `h8g8`, `h8f8`, `e8f8`, `e8d8`, `e8g8` - Moving the king is tempting, but it's difficult to find a safe square. `h8g8` looks like the best option for now, but it doesn't solve the problem.
*   **Rook moves:** `a8b8` - Doesn't seem to help much.
*   **Queen moves:** `c6d8`, `c6b8`, `c6a5`, `c6d4`, `c6b4` - The queen is well-placed, but moving it now might expose the king further.
*   **Bishop moves:** `e7f8`, `e7d8`, `e7f6`, `e7d6`, `e7g5`, `e7h4` - The bishop on e7 is important for defense. `e7f6` looks interesting, developing the bishop and potentially blocking some attacks.
*   **Pawn moves:** `h7h6`, `g7g6`, `f7f6`, `d7d6`, `a7a6`, `c5c4`, `h7h5`, `g7g5`, `f7f5`, `d7d5`, `a7a5` - Pawn moves are generally slow, but some could be useful for defense.
*   **Other pawn moves:** `b6d8`, `b6c7`, `b6a6`, `b6b5`, `b6a5`, `b6b4`, `b6b3` - These pawn moves don't seem to help.
*   **Knight moves:** `e4f6`, `e4d6`, `e4g5`, `e4g3`, `e4c3`, `e4f2`, `e4d2` - These knight moves are all from white.

Considering the threats, I think the best move is to develop the bishop and try to consolidate the position.

Alright, I have a list of legal moves. Let's analyze the position. White has a strong center and is threatening to develop their pieces quickly. Black needs to develop and challenge White's control of the center.

I see a few options. Moving the Queen's Bishop to develop it seems like a good idea. I could move it to e7, which develops the bishop and potentially eyes the weak f6 square. I could also move the pawn in front of the king to h6 or h5 to prepare for castling.

I think developing the bishop is the most active move.

So I will make the move e7e5.

That's a lot of moves! Let's analyze the position. White seems to have a strong attack developing, and my king is somewhat exposed. I need to be careful.

*   **King safety:** Moving the king is tempting, but I need to be sure it's to a safe square.
*   **Development:** I need to develop my pieces to counterattack.
*   **Defense:** I need to defend against White's threats.

Considering the options, I think I should develop my queen's bishop to a more active square. The move ...Bg4 looks interesting, attacking the knight on f3 and potentially opening lines.

Okay, I've reviewed the legal moves. The position is complex. Black's king is somewhat exposed, and white has a strong attack. I need to defend and develop my pieces.

I'll play **...h7h6**. This move supports the g7 pawn, preventing a potential white attack on g7. It also prepares for a possible ...g5 advance later.

Alright, I have a good understanding of the position and the available moves. Black is under some pressure, but there are several reasonable options.

The most pressing issue is the attack on the h-file. White's rook on h1 and the potential for a queen battery are dangerous. I need to address this.

I'm going to move my rook to h7 to defend the h-file.

Okay, I've reviewed the legal moves. The position is complex, and I need to think carefully. White has a strong attack, and I need to defend and develop my pieces.

I see a few options:

*   **Defensive moves:** like moving the rook on a8 to defend the back rank.
*   **Developing moves:** like moving the pawn on g7 or a7.
*   **Counterattacking moves:** like moving the queen.

I think the best approach is to develop a piece and prepare for a counterattack. The move `g7g6` seems like a solid developing move, preparing to fianchetto the bishop on f8.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, that's a lot to consider. White's queen and bishop are eyeing my kingside. I need to prioritize defending against that.

*   **e8f8, e8d8, e8e7, a8d8, a8c8, a8b8, h7h8, h7g7:** These rook and king moves don't seem to address the immediate threat.
*   **f6h8, f6d8, f6g7, f6e7, f6g5, f6h4:** The knight moves are interesting. f6g5 attacks the bishop, but it might open up the position further. f6h4 looks like a desperate attempt to attack the knight, but it doesn't really help.
*   **c6d8, c6b8, c6e7, c6a5, c6d4, c6b4:** The queen moves are also interesting. c6d4 looks like a good developing move, attacking the pawn on e2.
*   **b6d8, b6c7, b6a6, b6b5, b6a5, b6b4, b6b3:** The pawn moves don't seem to help much.
*   **e4d6, e4g5, e4g3, e4c3, e4f2, e4d2:** These are pawn moves and don't seem to help.
*   **d5c4:** This pawn move doesn't seem to help.
*   **a7a6, h6h5, g6g5, d5d4, a7a5:** These pawn moves don't seem to help.

I think the best move here is to develop my queen and put pressure on White's center. I'll move my queen to d4, attacking the pawn on e2.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, that's a lot of moves. Let's analyze them.

*   **King moves (e8f8, e8d8, e8e7):** Moving the king doesn't seem immediately necessary, and could potentially weaken the position further.
*   **Rook moves (a8d8, a8c8, a8b8, h7h8, h7g7):** The rook on h7 is a bit passive. Moving it to h8 might be useful later. The rook on a8 is also not doing much.
*   **Knight moves (f6h8, f6d8, f6g7, f6e7, f6g5, f6h4):** The knight on f6 is a key defender. Moving it away seems risky.
*   **Pawn moves (b6d8, b6c7, b6e6, b6d6, b6c6, b6a6, b6b5, b6a5, b6b4, b6b3, e4d6, e4g5, e4g3, e4c3, e4f2, e4d2, d4e6, d4c6, d4f5, d4b5, d4f3, d4b3, d4e2, d4c2, d5c4, a7a6, h6h5, g6g5, a7a5):** There are a lot of pawn moves. Pushing pawns can open lines, but also weaken the pawn structure.

Considering the position, I think the most important thing is to address the threat of the white queen. I need to develop my pieces and try to create some counterplay.

I'm going to move my pawn to **g5**. This attacks the white knight on f3, potentially forcing it to move, and opens up the h-file for my rook.

Okay, I see the board. White has a strong center and is threatening to attack. I need to find a good defensive move that also develops my pieces. Let's see what moves are available.

e8f8,e8d8,e8e7,a8d8,a8c8,a8b8,h7h8,h7g7,f6h8,f6d8,f6g7,f6e7,b6d8,b6c7,b6e6,b6d6,b6c6,b6a6,b6b5,b6a5,b6b4,e4d6,e4g3,e4c3,e4f2,e4d2,d4e6,d4c6,d4f5,d4b5,d4f3,d4b3,d4e2,d4c2,d5c4,c5b4,a7a6,h6h5,a7a5

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Okay, I have a lot of options. Let's analyze them.

*   **Rook moves:** Moving the rooks doesn't seem immediately helpful.
*   **Pawn moves:** `h7h8` is not a good move. `e8e7` is a good move to defend the king.
*   **Knight moves:** The knight moves don't seem to develop my pieces effectively.
*   **Queen moves:** The queen moves are not useful at this moment.
*   **Pawn moves:** `a7a6` and `h6h5` are not good moves.
*   **Bishop moves:** The bishop moves are not useful at this moment.
*   **Pawn moves:** `a7a5` is not a good move.

I think the best move here is to defend the king with `e8e7`.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Okay, that's a lot of moves. Let's analyze the most critical ones.

*   **Defensive moves:** I need to protect my king. The rook on a8 can move to h8, g8, f8, e8, d8, c8, or b8. Moving the rook to h8 seems like a good idea to protect the back rank.
*   **Development:** I need to develop my pieces to counter White's attack. The knight on b6 has several options.
*   **Attacking moves:** I don't see any immediate attacking opportunities.

Considering the threats and the need for development, I think moving the rook on a8 to h8 is the most pressing move to defend the king.

Alright, that's a lot to consider. White's queen is a major threat. I need to address that. Let's look at the moves that directly challenge the queen or defend against her immediate threats.

*   **...Qd8** - This seems like a good developing move, putting my queen on the back rank to defend.
*   **...Bg7** - This develops the bishop and defends the king.
*   **...e6** - This supports the pawn structure and prepares to develop the bishop.

Let's go with ...Bg7 to develop a piece and defend the king.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Okay, I have a lot of options. White is clearly attacking, so I need to prioritize defense. Let's analyze some of the key threats:

*   **White's Queen:** The queen on d4 is a major threat.
*   **White's Bishop on c3:** This bishop is eyeing my king.
*   **White's Knights:** The knights on e4 and f6 are well-placed.

Considering the threats, I need to find a move that:

1.  **Defends the King:** The most important thing.
2.  **Develops a piece:** If possible.
3.  **Prevents further attacks:**

Let's look at some candidate moves:

*   **...Bg8:** This seems like a reasonable move to develop the bishop and defend the king.
*   **...Qc7:** This move defends the king and develops the queen.
*   **...f6:** This move blocks the knight on e4, but it weakens the king's position.
*   **...h5:** This move doesn't seem to help much.

I think **...Qc7** is the best move. It develops the queen to a safe square, defends the king, and prepares for potential counterplay.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, that's a lot of moves. Let's analyze them.

*   **King moves (e7f8, e7e8, e7d8, e7f6, e7e6, e7d6):** These don't really help. The king is still exposed.
*   **Queen moves (c7d8, c7c8, c7b8, c7d7, c7d6, c7c6, c7b6, c7a5):** Some of these look interesting. Moving the queen might help defend, but it also might get trapped.
*   **Bishop moves (g7f8, g7f6):** These don't seem to help much.
*   **Pawn moves (h6h5, g5g4, f7f6, f7f5, b7b6, b7b5, a7a6, a7a5):** These are mostly defensive, but don't address the immediate threats.
*   **Knight moves (e4f6, e4d6, e4g3, e4c3, e4f2, e4d2):** The knight is pinned, so these moves are not legal.
*   **Pawn moves (d5c4, c5b4):** These are not legal.

The most promising line seems to be to try and develop some counterplay with the queen. The move **c7c6** seems to be the best option. It defends the pawn on d5, potentially opens a line for the bishop on g7, and prepares to challenge the center.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, that's a lot of moves. The immediate threat is the white queen on d4. I need to consider that first.

*   **h8g8, h8f8, h8e8:** Moving the rook doesn't immediately help.
*   **g7f8, g7f6, e7f8, e7e8, e7d8, e7f6, e7d6:** Moving the bishop doesn't seem to solve the problem.
*   **g6f6, g6e6, g6d6, g6c6, g6b6, g6a6, g6h5, g6f5:** Moving the knight doesn't help.
*   **e4f6, e4d6, e4g3, e4c3, e4f2, e4d2:** Moving the knight doesn't help.
*   **d4e6, d4c6, d4f5, d4b5, d4f3, d4b3, d4e2, d4c2:** These are all pawn moves, and none of them block the queen or develop a piece.
*   **g5f4, e5f4, d5c4, c5b4:** These are pawn moves, and none of them block the queen or develop a piece.
*   **f7f6, b7b6, a7a6, h6h5, g5g4, f7f5, b7b5, a7a5:** These are pawn moves, and none of them block the queen or develop a piece.

The best move seems to be to move the queen to block the check.

You are absolutely right! I made a mistake. I was looking at the wrong square for my queen. My queen is on g6, not d5. I need to block the check from the white queen on d4. The correct move is to move the queen to c6.

*   **...Qc6** puts pressure on the kingside and attacks the knight on f6.
*   **...e4f6** is a tempting tactical shot.

I'll go with the more active move, developing my queen and attacking the knight.

Okay, I have the legal moves. White's queen is a major threat. I need to find a move that addresses this.

*   **h8g8, h8f8, h8e8:** Moving the rook doesn't seem to help much.

*   **c5b4, b7b6, a7a6, h6h5, g5g4, c5c4, b7b5, a7a5:** Pushing pawns doesn't seem to address the immediate threat.

The best move seems to be to move the queen to a safer square. I will move the queen to d8.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, I've got the legal moves. White's pressure is significant. Let's analyze the options:

*   **Defensive moves:**
    *   `h8g8`, `h8f8`, `h8e8`: Moving the Rook doesn't seem to help much against the immediate threats.
    *   `d8e8`, `d8c8`, `d8e7`, `d8c7`: Moving the Bishop doesn't immediately alleviate the pressure.
    *   `f6e7`, `f6g6`, `f6e6`, `f6d6`, `f6c6`, `f6b6`, `f6a6`, `f6f5`, `f6f4`, `f6f3`: The pawn moves don't seem to address the threats.
    *   `e4d6`, `e4g3`, `e4c3`, `e4f2`, `e4d2`: These are all pawn moves that don't help.
    *   `d4e6`, `d4c6`, `d4f5`, `d4b5`, `d4f3`, `d4b3`, `d4e2`, `d4c2`: These are pawn moves that don't help.
    *   `c5b4`, `b7b6`, `a7a6`, `h6h5`, `g5g4`, `c5c4`, `b7b5`, `a7a5`: These are pawn moves that don't help.

*   **Attacking moves:**
    *   None of the moves seem to be attacking.

The most critical threat seems to be the white Queen and Rook on the seventh rank. I need to find a way to defend against this. Moving the Bishop seems like the best option.

I'll move the Bishop to defend the King. I'll move the Bishop from f8 to e7.

Let's re-evaluate. The Queen and Rook on the seventh rank are the biggest threats. The Bishop on g7 can move to f8, which might be a good defensive move. Let's try that.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, I've got a lot of options. Let's analyze the most pressing issues. White's queen on d3 is a major threat. The knights are also well-placed to attack. My king is vulnerable.

*   **Defensive considerations:** I need to defend against the immediate threats. Moving the bishop on f8 seems like a good idea.
*   **Development:** I need to develop my pieces to counterattack.
*   **Candidate moves:**
    *   `f8g7`: Develops the bishop and potentially blocks some attacks.
    *   `f8e7`: Develops the bishop, but might be less active.
    *   `d8e7`: Develops the queen, but might be too passive.
    *   `f6g6`: Moves the knight, but doesn't seem to help much.
    *   `g5g4`: Opens the g-file, but might weaken my king's defense.
    *   `c5c4`: Challenges the center.

I think `f8g7` is the most solid move. It develops the bishop to a good square, potentially defends against some threats, and doesn't weaken my position.

Okay, I've got a lot of options. White's queen on d4 is a clear target. Let's see...

*   **...Qe7** attacks the queen directly. This forces White to respond, and I think it's a strong developing move.

Let's make the move.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, I've got the legal moves. White is clearly trying to exploit the open h-file and the exposed Black King. I need to be careful.

*   **h8g8, h8f8, h8e8:** Moving the Rook doesn't seem to help much immediately.
*   **g7f8, e7f8, e7e8, e7d8, e7d6:** Moving the Bishop is interesting, but it doesn't immediately solve the problem.
*   **f6g6, f6e6, f6d6, f6c6, f6b6, f6a6, f6f5, f6f4, f6f3:** The pawn moves don't seem to help much.
*   **e4d6, e4g3, e4c3, e4f2, e4d2:** The Knight moves are interesting, but don't immediately address the threat.
*   **d4e6, d4c6, d4f5, d4b5, d4f3, d4b3, d4e2, d4c2:** The pawn moves don't seem to help much.
*   **b7b6, a7a6, h6h5, g5g4, c5c4, a7a5:** These pawn moves are mostly passive.

The most critical threat is the White Queen. I need to find a way to defend against it. I see a few possibilities.

I think the best move here is to try and develop the Bishop and challenge the Queen.

I'll move the Bishop to f8, hoping to trade it for the Queen.

*   **...b7b6**: This supports the pawn structure.

I think ...f6f5 is the most forcing move, as it immediately challenges the queen.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, I have a list of legal moves. White's queen is a major threat. Let's analyze the options.

*   **Defensive moves:**
    *   `f8h8, f8g8, f8e8`: Moving the bishop doesn't seem to help much against the immediate threats.
    *   `h7h8, g7h8, e7e8, e7d8`: These pawn moves don't address the queen's attack.
    *   `f7f6, b7b6, a7a6, h6h5, g5g4, c5c4, a7a5`: These pawn moves are slow and don't help against the immediate threat.
*   **Developing moves:**
    *   `g7f6`: This develops the bishop, but doesn't address the queen.
    *   `e7f6, e7d6`: These moves don't seem to help.
*   **Attacking moves:**
    *   `f5c8, f5d7, f5g6, f5f6, f5e6, f5g4, f5f4, f5e4, f5h3, f5f3, f5f2`: These moves with the bishop are interesting.

The most promising move seems to be to develop the bishop and attack the queen. `f5g4` looks like a good option. It attacks the queen and forces white to react.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Okay, I've got the list of legal moves. The most pressing issue is the attack on the Black King. I need to consider moves that defend the king and develop my pieces.

*   **f8h8, f8g8, f8e8:** Moving the bishop doesn't seem to help much.
*   **h7h8:** Promoting the pawn to a rook seems like a desperate measure.
*   **g7h8, g7f6, e7e8, e7d8, e7f6, e7d6:** These moves with the pawns don't seem to improve the situation.
*   **g4c8, g4d7, g4e6, g4h5, g4f5, g4h4, g4f4, g4e4, g4h3, g4g3, g4f3, g4g2:** The bishop on g4 has some interesting options, but none of them seem to immediately solve the problem.
*   **c5d4:** This pawn move looks interesting, potentially opening lines for my pieces.
*   **f7f6, b7b6, a7a6, h6h5, c5c4, f7f5, a7a5:** These pawn moves don't seem to address the immediate threat.

Considering the position, I think the most promising move is to develop the bishop and try to create some counterplay. I'll move the bishop from g4 to e6. This attacks the white queen and potentially opens up the diagonal for my dark-squared bishop.

Alright, I've got a lot of options. White is clearly trying to exploit the open file and attack my king. I need to be careful.

Let's analyze some of the key moves:

*   **...f6:** This seems like a reasonable move. It blocks the potential advance of the white pawn on g5 and prepares to develop my bishop.
*   **...g6:** This also helps to defend the king.
*   **...e6:** This move seems passive and doesn't help develop my pieces.
*   **...f5:** This could be interesting, but it weakens my kingside.
*   **...c4:** This could open the position, but it might be too risky.

Considering the position, I think the best move is to solidify the kingside and develop my bishop.

I'll play **...f6**.

Okay, I see the board. White has a strong attack developing. Black's king is exposed. I need to find a move that addresses the immediate threats and tries to develop my pieces. Let's get the legal moves.

f8h8,f8g8,f8e8,f8f7,h7h8,g7h8,e7e8,e7d8,e7d6,e6g8,e6c8,e6f7,e6d7,e6d6,e6c6,e6b6,e6a6,e6f5,e6d5,e6g4,e6h3,e5d4,c5d4,b7b6,a7a6,h6h5,f6f5,g5g4,c5c4,a7a5

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, I've got a lot of options. White is clearly trying to exploit the open files and the exposed king. Let's analyze some of the key moves:

*   **...f8h8, ...f8g8, ...f8e8:** These moves with the bishop are not helpful. They don't address any immediate threats.
*   **...h7h8, ...g7h8:** These moves with the pawn are also not helpful.
*   **...e7e8, ...e7d8:** These moves with the pawn are not helpful.
*   **...e6g8, ...e6c8, ...e6f7, ...e6d7, ...e6d6, ...e6c6, ...e6b6, ...e6a6, ...e6f5, ...e6d5, ...e6g4, ...e6h3:** These moves with the queen are important. The queen is currently defending the king.
*   **...e5d4, ...c5d4:** These moves with the pawn are not helpful.
*   **...b7b6, ...a7a6, ...h6h5, ...f6f5, ...g5g4, ...c5c4, ...a7a5:** These pawn moves don't seem to help much.

The most critical threat is the white queen. I need to move my queen to a safe square. The best move is to move the queen to a square where it can defend the king and also potentially attack.

I believe the best move is to move the queen to d7. This defends the king, and it also opens up the possibility of developing the bishop on f8.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Okay, I've reviewed the legal moves. White is applying significant pressure. I need to find a move that defends and potentially creates counterplay.

*   **f8h8, f8g8, f8e8, f8f7:** Moving the bishop doesn't seem to address the immediate threats.
*   **h7h8, g7h8, e7e8, e7d8:** These moves are not helpful.
*   **e6e5:** This looks like a good defensive move, challenging the white queen and opening lines for my pieces.
*   **f6e5:** This is also a possibility, but it might weaken my pawn structure.
*   **c5d4, b7b6, a7a6, h6h5, f6f5, g5g4, c5c4, a7a5:** These pawn moves don't seem to address the immediate threats.

I think **e6e5** is the best move. It defends against the immediate threats and opens lines for my pieces.

*   **e7d6**: Moving the pawn on e7 to d6.
*   **b7c6**: Moving the pawn on b7 to c6.

Promoting the pawn to a queen seems like the most aggressive and potentially advantageous move. It immediately creates a second queen, which could be devastating. Let's try that.

Alright, I have a lot of options. Let's break this down. The Black King is currently in a precarious position. White has a strong attack. I need to prioritize defense and development.

*   **King Safety:** Moving the King is risky, but I need to consider it. `e8f7` looks like a reasonable escape route.
*   **Developing Pieces:** The Bishop on f8 is currently blocked.
*   **Pawn Structure:** I have some pawn moves available.

Considering the position, I think the best move is to develop my Bishop and defend the King.

Alright, I've got a list of legal moves. Let's analyze them.

*   **e8f8, e8d8, e8e7:** Moving the King. Not ideal, as it's generally safer in the center.
*   **h7h8, g7h8, g7f8, f7f8:** Promoting a pawn.
*   **f7e7, f7d7, f7c7:** Moving the pawn.
*   **f6e5:** Moving the Bishop.
*   **b7b6, a7a6:** Moving the pawns.
*   **h6h5:** Moving the pawn.
*   **f6f5:** Moving the Bishop.
*   **g5g4:** Moving the pawn.
*   **c5c4:** Moving the pawn.
*   **a7a5:** Moving the pawn.

The most interesting options seem to be the pawn promotions. Promoting the pawn on h7 to a Queen (h7h8) seems like the strongest move, as it immediately adds a powerful piece to the board.

Therefore, I will make the move h7h8.

*   **h8g8, h8f8, h8h7:** Moving the rook on h8. These moves don't seem immediately threatening.
*   **e8f8, e8d8, e8e7:** Moving the king. The king is currently relatively safe, and these moves don't seem to improve its position or create immediate threats.
*   **g7f8:** Moving the bishop. This doesn't seem to achieve much.
*   **f7f8, f7e7, f7d7, f7c7:** Moving the pawn on f7. These moves open the diagonal for the bishop, but don't seem to be immediately impactful.
*   **f6e5:** Moving the pawn on f6. This opens up the diagonal for the bishop and attacks the knight. This looks promising.
*   **c5d4:** Moving the pawn on c5. This doesn't seem to be very useful.
*   **b7b6, a7a6, h6h5, f6f5, g5g4, c5c4, a7a5:** Pawn moves. These are mostly positional and don't create immediate threats.

**Decision:**

The move **f6e5** looks like the most promising move. It attacks the knight, opens the diagonal for the bishop, and potentially creates a threat against the king.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, I have a list of legal moves. The king has several escape squares. I also see pawn moves that could block the check. Let's analyze the options:

*   **King moves:** e8f8, e8d8, e8d7. Moving the king is generally a good option to get out of check.
*   **Pawn moves:** g7h8, g7f8, g7f6, f7f8, f7e7, f7d7, f7c7, f7f6, f7f5, f7f4, f7f3, e5d4, c5d4, b7b6, a7a6, h6h5, g5g4, e5e4, c5c4, a7a5. Some of these are blocking the check.

The immediate threat is the rook on h7. I need to prioritize getting the king out of check.

*   **e8f8:** This looks like a good move, moving the king to safety.

I'll move the king to f8.

Alright, I have a lot of options. White's king is vulnerable. I need to prioritize attacking the king or developing a strong attack.

*   **...f7f6:** This defends the rook on f8 and prepares to develop the bishop.
*   **...g7f6:** This also defends the rook and opens the g-file for a potential attack.
*   **...h7h8:** This promotes the pawn to a queen, which is a very strong move.

Promoting the pawn to a queen seems like the most forcing move, since it immediately puts the white king under pressure.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, I have a good number of options. Let's analyze them.

*   **Pawn moves:** `h8g8, h8h7, f7e7, f7d7, f7c7, f7f6, f7f5, f7f4, f7f3, b7b6, a7a6, h6h5, g5g4, c5c4, a7a5` These are all pawn moves. Some advance the pawns, some defend.
*   **Bishop moves:** `f8g8, e5d4, c5d4, c5b4` The bishop moves are limited by the pawn structure.
*   **Other moves:**

I need to consider the threats and my overall strategy. White's king is somewhat exposed. I need to develop my pieces and put pressure on the white king.

The move `f7f5` looks interesting. It attacks the center and opens the diagonal for my bishop.

Therefore, I will move my pawn from f7 to f5.

Okay, I see the board. Black's king is on e8, and white's king is on e7. I need to assess the threats and develop a plan. I'll get the legal moves to see my options.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Okay, I have the legal moves. Let's analyze them.

*   **h8g8, h8h7:** Moving the rook doesn't seem immediately helpful.
*   **f8g8, f8e8, f8f7:** Moving the bishop. f8f7 looks interesting, developing the bishop and potentially eyeing the weak f2 pawn.
*   **g7f6:** Moving the knight. This develops the knight, but doesn't seem to immediately impact the position.
*   **f4f7, f4f6, f4f5, f4h4, f4g4, f4e4, f4f3:** These are pawn moves.
*   **b6c5:** This pawn move challenges the center.
*   **a7a6, h6h5, g5g4, a7a5:** Other pawn moves.

I think developing the bishop to f7 is a good developing move that also puts some pressure on the f2 pawn.

Alright, I've got a list of legal moves. The most pressing concern is the exposed king. I need to consider how to improve the king's safety.

*   **h8h7**: This seems like a reasonable move to develop the rook and potentially connect the rooks later.
*   **g7f6**: This is a developing move for the bishop.
*   **f7f6**: This could help defend the king.
*   **f7f5**: This could open the position, but might expose the king further.
*   **a7a6**: This is a standard pawn move.
*   **a7a5**: This is a standard pawn move.

I'll choose to develop the rook and improve the king's safety a little.

Okay, I have a few options. Let's analyze them.

*   **Pawn moves:** I have pawn moves on a7, g7, f7, and h6.

*   **g7** can move to g6 or g5.
*   **h6** can move to h5.
*   **a7** can move to a6 or a5.
*   **f4** can move to f3, f5, f6, e4, g4, h4
*   **b6** can move to c5

I think the most important thing right now is to defend my king. I'll move the pawn on f7 to f6 to help protect the king.

Okay, I've got the list of legal moves. Let's analyze them.

*   **h7h8, g7h8, g7f8:** These involve promoting the pawn on h7 or moving the bishop. Promoting the pawn to a queen seems tempting, but it might not be the best in this position. Moving the bishop to h8 or f8 doesn't seem to improve the position significantly.
*   **f6f7, f6g6, f6e6, f6g5:** These are moves for the pawn on f6. f6f7 doesn't seem to help. f6g6 and f6e6 don't seem to improve the position. f6g5 looks interesting, potentially attacking the knight.
*   **f4f5, f4e4, f4f3:** These are moves for the pawn on f4. f4f5 doesn't seem to help. f4e4 doesn't seem to improve the position. f4f3 doesn't seem to improve the position.
*   **a7b6, g4h3, g4f3, a7a6, h6h5, g4g3, a7a5:** These are moves for the pawns on a7, g4, and h6. a7b6 doesn't seem to help. g4h3, g4f3, g4g3 don't seem to improve the position. a7a6 and a7a5 don't seem to improve the position. h6h5 doesn't seem to improve the position.

Considering the position, I think the best move is to attack the knight with the pawn.

*   **g5g6:** This pushes the pawn forward one square. It doesn't immediately threaten anything, but it advances the pawn towards promotion.
*   **g5f6:** This captures a pawn. This is a good tactical move, as it opens up the position and potentially creates a passed pawn.
*   **g5h5:** This pushes the pawn forward one square. It doesn't immediately threaten anything, but it advances the pawn towards promotion.

I think capturing the pawn on f6 is the most promising move. It opens up the position and gives me a material advantage.

*   **Pawn moves:** I can advance my pawns on the f-file (f6-f7, f6-f5, etc.) or the a-file (a7-a6, a7-a5).
*   **Pawn promotion:** I can promote my pawn on h7 to a queen or a rook.
*   **Bishop moves:** I can move my bishop on g7 to h8 or f8.

The most interesting move seems to be promoting my pawn on h7. I can promote it to a queen or a rook. Promoting to a queen seems like the most powerful option.

Therefore, I will promote my pawn on h7 to a queen.

Failed to make move: illegal uci: 'h7h8q' in 8/p5br/1P1P1k1p/1P2p3/P3PrPP/1R2N3/4K2R/2B5 b - - 0 55

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

You are absolutely right! I apologize for the mistake. I should have checked the board more carefully. I see that the h-file is blocked by a white rook. Therefore, I cannot promote my pawn on h7.

Let's re-evaluate the position. My king is somewhat exposed, and white has a strong pawn structure. I need to find a way to create some counterplay and protect my king.

Let's look at the other moves.

*   **f-pawn:** f6-f7 seems like a reasonable move to challenge white's pawn structure.
*   **Bishop:** Moving the bishop to f8 might be useful to control the long diagonal.
*   **a-pawn:** a7-a6 or a7-a5 don't seem to be immediately helpful.

I think the most promising move is to challenge the white pawn structure with f6-f7.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Okay, I see the legal moves. The bishop on f8 has a few options. The pawn on h7 can move. The pawn on f4 has a lot of options. The pawn on a7 can move. The pawn on h6 can move.

Let's analyze a bit. Moving the bishop to g7 (f8g7) doesn't seem to do much. Moving the bishop to e8 (f8e8) is also not very active. Moving the bishop to f7 (f8f7) seems like a reasonable developing move, putting the bishop on a more active square.

The pawn moves on f4 are tempting, but they weaken the pawn structure. The pawn moves on a7 are also not very active.

The pawn on h6 to h5 seems like a good move, it attacks the white pawn on g4.

Therefore, I will move the pawn on h6 to h5.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Okay, I have a lot of options. White has pushed e4, so I need to think about how to respond. I see several possibilities:

*   **...Nf6:** This is a standard developing move, controlling central squares and preparing to challenge white's control of the center.
*   **...e6:** This supports the pawn on d7 and prepares to develop the light-squared bishop.
*   **...d5:** This directly challenges white's control of the center.

I think ...Nf6 is a solid, flexible move. Let's play that.

*   **...Nf6:** This is a standard developing move, controlling central squares and preparing for further development.
*   **...e6:** This supports the pawn structure and prepares to develop the light-squared bishop.
*   **...d5:** This challenges white's control of the center.

I think ...Nf6 is a solid and flexible move. It develops a piece, controls important squares, and doesn't commit to a specific plan too early.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, I have a lot of options. Let's break it down:

*   **Pawn moves:** I can push my pawns on the kingside (h7, g7), queenside (a7, b7, c7, d7), and the e-file. Pushing the e-pawn is tempting to challenge the center.
*   **Knight moves:** My knight on f6 has several squares to go to.
*   **Bishop moves:** My dark-squared bishop on f8 has a few diagonals open.
*   **King moves:** The king can only move to e7.
*   **Queen moves:** The queen can move to e7.

Considering the position, I think a good developing move is to develop the knight to c6. This controls the center and prepares for further development.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, I've got a good list of moves. Let's evaluate.

*   **Pawn moves:** I have a lot of pawn moves available. Pushing the pawns in front of my king (h7h6, g7g6) is generally a good idea for king safety, but it's not urgent here. Pushing d7d6 or b7b6 could be useful later to control the center.
*   **Bishop moves:** The bishop on f8 has a few diagonals open. f8e7 looks like a reasonable developing move. f8d6, f8c5, f8b4 are a bit more aggressive, but could be useful later.
*   **King moves:** e8e7 is a possibility, but I don't see an immediate need to move the king.
*   **Rook moves:** a8b8 is a developing move.
*   **Knight moves:** The knight on c6 has several options. c6e7 is a developing move. c6a5, c6d4, c6b4 are more aggressive, but might not be the best in this position.
*   **Other moves:** e5d4 is a pawn capture.

Considering the position, I think a good developing move is in order. I'll develop my bishop to e7.

Okay, I have a list of legal moves. Let's analyze them.

*   **Pawn moves:** `g7g6`, `d7d6`, `b7b6`, `a7a6`, `h6h5`, `g7g5`, `d7d5`, `a7a5` - These are all standard pawn moves. I need to consider which pawn structure I want to aim for.
*   **Bishop moves:** `e7f8`, `e7d6`, `e7c5`, `e7b4` - The bishop on e7 has some options.
*   **Knight moves:** `f6g8`, `f6h7`, `f6h5`, `f6d5`, `f6g4`, `f6e4`, `c6b8`, `c6a5`, `c6d4`, `c6b4` - The knights have a lot of options.
*   **Rook moves:** `h8g8`, `h8f8`, `h8h7`, `a8b8` - The rooks have limited options.
*   **King moves:** `e8f8`, `e8g8` - The king has limited options.
*   **Pawn capture:** `e5d4` - This is a possible pawn capture.

The position is relatively open. White has a strong center and is threatening to develop their pieces. I need to develop my pieces and challenge White's control of the center.

I think developing the knight on f6 is a good idea. `f6d5` looks like a good move, challenging the center and potentially opening lines for my queen and bishop.

Alright, I have a lot of options. Let's analyze a few of the more interesting ones.

*   **...h8g8:** Moving the Rook doesn't seem to achieve much immediately.
*   **...e7f6:** Developing the Bishop to f6 looks interesting. It attacks the knight on g4 and prepares to control the long diagonal.
*   **...e7d6:** This also develops the Bishop, but it's less active.
*   **...c6e5:** This attacks the knight on f3 and opens the diagonal for the Queen.
*   **...g7g6:** This supports the pawn structure and prepares for ...f5.
*   **...f7f6:** This supports the pawn structure and prepares for ...e5.
*   **...d7d6:** This supports the pawn structure and prepares for ...e5.
*   **...g7g5:** This is a more aggressive pawn push, but it weakens the kingside.
*   **...f7f5:** This is a more aggressive pawn push, but it weakens the kingside.
*   **...d5f6:** This develops the Bishop, but it's less active.

I like the idea of developing the Bishop to f6. It puts pressure on the knight on g4 and opens the diagonal for the Queen. I'll play ...Bf6.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, I've got a good list of moves. Let's analyze.

*   **Pawn moves:** I see a lot of pawn moves available. Pushing the pawns on the kingside (h7, g5) could be interesting for a kingside attack later. Pushing the pawns in front of the queen (d6) seems solid. Pushing the b and a pawns (b6, a6) could be useful for controlling squares.
*   **Knight moves:** The knight on f6 has a few options. Moving it to e7 seems like a good developing move.
*   **Bishop moves:** The bishop on c8 doesn't have many options right now.
*   **Rook moves:** The rooks on a8 and h8 have limited options.
*   **Queen moves:** The queen on d8 has some options, but nothing immediately threatening.
*   **King moves:** The king has no moves.

Considering the position, I think a good developing move is to move the knight to e7. This develops a piece, controls important central squares, and prepares for future actions.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, I have a good list of moves. Let's consider the options.

*   **Pawn moves:** There are a lot of pawn moves available. Pushing the pawns on the h, g, f, a, and b files don't seem to immediately improve my position. Pushing the e-pawn is interesting, but it opens up the diagonal for the white bishop.
*   **Bishop moves:** The bishop on f8 has a few options. Moving it to g7 or h6 doesn't seem to achieve much.
*   **Knight moves:** The knight on c6 has several options. Nc6-b8 doesn't seem great. Nc6-e5 could be interesting, attacking the pawn on f7. Nc6-d4 attacks the pawn on f7 and opens up the diagonal for the queen.
*   **Rook moves:** The rook on a8 has a few options.
*   **King moves:** The king has no moves.
*   **Queen moves:** The queen has no moves.

I think the most promising moves are either Nc6-d4 or Nc6-e5. Nc6-d4 seems more active, attacking the pawn on f7 and opening the diagonal for the queen.

I'll go with **Nc6-d4**.

Okay, that's a lot of moves. Let's analyze a few key possibilities.

*   **Developing the Bishop:** ...Bf6 looks interesting, attacking the knight on d4 and potentially opening the diagonal for the queen.
*   **Pawn Advances:** Pushing pawns like ...h5 or ...g5 could help create attacking chances on the kingside, but might also weaken the pawn structure.
*   **Queen Moves:** The queen is well-placed, but moving it now might not be the best use of the turn.

Considering the position, I think developing the bishop to f6 is a good developing move that also creates a threat.

*   **Pawn moves:** Pushing pawns like ...h7, ...g5, ...c6, ...b6, ...a6, ...h5, ...c5, ...b5, ...a5 are all possible, but don't seem to immediately improve my position.
*   **Knight moves:** ...Ng7, ...Ne7, ...Ng5, ...Ne5, ...Nh4 are all possible, but the knight on f6 is well-placed.
*   **Bishop moves:** ...Be7, ...Bf8 are possible, but the bishop on c8 is blocked.
*   **Queen moves:** ...Qe7, ...Qe8, ...Qd7 are possible, but the queen is well-placed.
*   **Rook moves:** ...Ra8b8 are possible, but the rooks are well-placed.
*   **King moves:** ...Ke7, ...Kf8 are possible, but the king is well-placed.

I think the most active move here is to develop the dark-squared bishop. ...Bf8 doesn't seem to do much. ...Be7 is a good developing move that also helps to defend the king.

Therefore, I will move the bishop to E7.

*   **f7e6, d7e6, d7d6, c7c6, b7b6, a7a6, h6h5, g6g5, c7c5, b7b5, a7a5:** Pawn moves.

The most pressing issue is the queen. I'm going to play `e7e6` to block the queen's attack and develop my queen.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Okay, I have a lot of options. The most pressing concern is the attack on my king. I see a few defensive moves, but I need to be careful.

*   **...h8g8, ...h8f8, ...a8b8, ...e8f8, ...e8d8, ...e8e7**: These moves with the rooks and king don't immediately address the threat and might even worsen the position.
*   **...f6g7, ...f6e7, ...f6g5, ...f6e5, ...f6h4**: These moves with the bishop are interesting, but they don't seem to directly defend the king.
*   **...e6e7, ...e6d6, ...e6c6, ...e6b6, ...e6a6, ...e6f5, ...e6e5, ...e6g4, ...e6e4, ...e6e3, ...e6e2**: These pawn moves are not helpful.
*   **...d5e7, ...d5b6, ...d5f4, ...d5b4, ...d5e3, ...d5c3**: These knight moves look promising. ...Nd5f4 attacks the queen and might force a trade or deflection.
*   **...d4c6, ...d4f5, ...d4b5, ...d4f3, ...d4b3, ...d4e2, ...d4c2**: These knight moves are also interesting, but they don't seem to address the immediate threat.
*   **...d7d6, ...c7c6, ...b7b6, ...a7a6, ...h6h5, ...g6g5, ...c7c5, ...b7b5, ...a7a5**: These pawn moves are not helpful.

The most promising move seems to be ...Nf6f4. It attacks the queen and forces White to react. This gives me a chance to consolidate my position.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Okay, that's a lot of moves! Let's analyze them.

*   **King moves:** `h8g8`, `h8f8`, `e8f8`, `e8d8`, `e8e7`, `e8g8` - Moving the king is usually a last resort, especially early in the game. I don't want to expose my king further.
*   **Rook moves:** `a8b8`, `h8h7` - The rook on h8 is currently blocked. Moving the rook on a8 to b8 seems reasonable to connect my rooks.
*   **Bishop moves:** `f6d8`, `f6g7`, `f6e7`, `f6g5`, `f6e5`, `f6h4`, `f6d4`, `f6c3` - The bishop on f6 has a lot of options. Moving it to e7 seems like a good developing move, controlling important squares.
*   **Queen moves:** No queen moves available.
*   **Knight moves:** `d5e7`, `d5b6`, `d5f4`, `d5b4`, `d5e3`, `d5c3` - The knight on d5 has many options. Moving it to e7 seems like a good developing move, controlling important squares.
*   **Pawn moves:** `e6e7`, `e6d6`, `e6c6`, `e6b6`, `e6a6`, `e6f5`, `e6e5`, `e6g4`, `e6e4`, `e6e3`, `e6e2`, `d7d6`, `c7c6`, `b7b6`, `a7a6`, `h6h5`, `g6g5`, `c7c5`, `b7b5`, `a7a5` - I have many pawn moves. Pushing the e-pawn to e5 seems like a good way to challenge white's queen and control the center.

Considering the position, I think the best move is to develop my knight to e7. This will help control the center and prepare for further development.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, that's a lot of moves to consider! Let's break this down.

*   **King moves:** `e8f8, e8d8, e8e7` - Moving the King right now doesn't seem ideal. It's exposed.
*   **Rook moves:** `a8b8, h7h8, h7g7` - The Rook on a8 is blocked. The Rook on h7 has some options, but nothing immediately threatening.
*   **Bishop moves:** `f6h8, f6d8, f6g7, f6e7, f6g5, f6e5, f6h4, f6d4, f6c3, f6b2` - The Bishop on f6 has a lot of potential. Developing it is a good idea.
*   **Pawn moves:** `e6e7, e6d6, e6c6, e6b6, e6a6, e6f5, e6e5, e6g4, e6e4, e6e3, e6e2, d5e7, d5b6, d5f4, d5b4, d5e3, d5c3, c7c6, b7b6, a7a6, h6h5, g6g5, c7c5, a7a5` - Lots of pawn moves. Pushing pawns can open lines, but we need to be careful not to weaken our position.
*   **Queen moves:** None.
*   **Knight moves:** None.

My initial thought is to develop the Bishop on f6. The move `f6e7` looks interesting, as it develops the Bishop and potentially eyes the weak f2 pawn.

Let's make the move.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, I have a lot of options. White's queen is a threat, and I need to address that. Let's analyze a few possibilities:

*   **...Qf6:** This directly challenges the Queen and develops a piece. However, it allows White to exchange queens, which might simplify the position and remove some of the immediate pressure.
*   **...e6-e5:** This challenges the center and opens lines for my pieces. It also attacks the White Queen.
*   **...c7-c6:** This supports the pawn structure and prepares to develop the Bishop on b7.
*   **...f7-f6:** This supports the pawn structure and prepares to develop the Bishop on e7.

Considering the immediate threat of the White Queen, and the need to develop, I think ...e6-e5 is the best move. It attacks the queen, opens lines for my pieces, and challenges White in the center.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Okay, I have a lot of options. Let's analyze them.

*   **King moves (e8f8, e8d8):** Moving the King doesn't seem immediately necessary, and it might further expose him.
*   **Rook moves (a8b8, h7h8):** The Rook on a8 is blocked. Moving the Rook on h7 to h8 doesn't seem to improve the position significantly.
*   **Bishop moves (e7f8, e7d8, e7f6, e7d6, e7g5, e7c5, e7h4):** The Bishop on e7 has a lot of potential. Developing it is a good idea. e7f6 seems like a reasonable developing move, controlling some key squares. e7g5 attacks the knight, but it might be too aggressive.
*   **Pawn moves (h6h5, g6g5, f7f6, d7d6, c7c6, b7b6, a7a6, f7f5, b7b5, a7a5):** Pawn moves are generally less important in the opening, but some can be useful.
*   **Queen moves (d5f6, d5b6, d5f4, d5b4, d5e3, d5c3):** The Queen is well-placed, but moving it now might not be the best use of the Queen.
*   **Pawn moves (e5h8, e5g7, e5f6, e5e6, e5d6, e5h5, e5g5, e5f5, e5f4, e5e4, e5d4, e5g3, e5e3, e5c3, e5h2, e5e2):** These moves are not legal.

Considering the position, I think developing the Bishop to f6 is a good developing move. It controls important squares and prepares for further development.

Alright, that's a lot of moves. White's queen is a major threat. I need to address that. Let's look at some candidate moves:

*   **...Qe7** This seems like a reasonable developing move, getting the queen out of the way of potential attacks and potentially eyeing the kingside. It also defends the f6 pawn.
*   **...d6** This supports the e5 pawn and prepares to develop the dark-squared bishop.
*   **...h5** This prevents White from playing g4, which could weaken my kingside.

I think ...Qe7 is the most active and flexible move. Let's try that.

Alright, I have a lot of options. White's queen is a major threat, and I need to address it. I see several possibilities:

*   **Defensive moves:** Moving the king (e8d8) is an option, but it doesn't address the immediate threats. Pushing pawns like h7h8, h7g7, d7d6, c7c6, b7b6, a7a6, h6h5, g6g5, b7b5, a7a5 are all possible, but don't seem to improve my position significantly.
*   **Developing moves:** Moving the bishop (f6) seems promising. f6g7, f6e7, f6g5, f6h4, f6d8, f6h8 are all options.
*   **Counterplay:** The move e5e6 seems interesting, but it doesn't seem to help much.

Considering the position, I think the best move is to develop my bishop to g7. This defends the king and prepares for further development.

*   **d5e7, d5f6, d5b6, d5f4, d5b4, d5e3, d5c3:** These are the knight moves.
*   **f7f6, d7d6, c7c6, b7b6, h6h5, g6g5, f7f5, c7c5, b7b5:** These are pawn moves.

The most active piece I have is my queen. I think the best move is to develop my queen to a square where it can defend my king and potentially counterattack. **Qe7** looks like a good option. It defends the king and prepares to develop the bishop.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Okay, I have a lot of options. White is threatening to push their pawns and open up the position. I need to be careful.

*   **e7e6** looks like a solid developing move. It supports the pawn on d5 and prepares to develop the bishop.
*   **f7f6** is another option, but it might weaken the kingside.
*   **d7d6** is also possible, but it might block in the dark-squared bishop.
*   **g7f6** is a possibility to develop the knight, but it might be too passive.

I think **e7e6** is the most solid and flexible move. It prepares for further development and solidifies the position.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Okay, I have a lot of options. Let's analyze them.

*   **King moves:** `e8f8`, `e8d8`, `e8e7` - Moving the King doesn't seem ideal right now, as it could further expose it.
*   **Rook moves:** `a8b8`, `a8a7`, `h7h8` - These moves don't immediately address the threats.
*   **Bishop moves:** `g7h8`, `g7f8`, `g7f6`, `g7e5`, `g7d4`, `g7c3` - Developing the Bishop is good, but the best square is unclear. `g7f6` looks interesting, defending the King and potentially controlling a key square.
*   **Queen moves:** `e6e7`, `e6f6`, `e6d6`, `e6c6`, `e6b6`, `e6a6`, `e6f5`, `e6e5`, `e6g4`, `e6e4` - The Queen is well-placed, but moving it now doesn't seem urgent.
*   **Pawn moves:** `d5e7`, `d5f6`, `d5b6`, `d5f4`, `d5b4`, `d5e3`, `d5c3`, `f7f6`, `d7d6`, `c7c6`, `b7b6`, `h6h5`, `g6g5`, `f7f5`, `c7c5`, `b7b5` - Pawn moves are generally less impactful in this position.

Considering the threats, I think the best move is to develop the Bishop to f6. This defends the King and controls a key square.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, I have a lot of options. White's threats are immediate, so I need to prioritize defense. Let's analyze some of the key moves:

*   **e8f8, e8d8, e8e7:** Moving the king is tempting, but it doesn't solve the underlying problems. It just delays the inevitable.
*   **a8b8, a8a7:** Moving the rook doesn't seem to help much.
*   **f6h8, f6d8, f6g7, f6e7, f6g5, f6e5, f6h4, f6d4, f6c3:** The knight has a lot of moves, but none of them seem to address the immediate threats.
*   **e6e7, e6d6, e6c6, e6b6, e6a6, e6f5, e6e5, e6d5, e6g4, e6e4, e6e3, e6e2, e6e1:** Pushing the pawns in front of the king is a good idea.
*   **d7d6, c7c6, b7b6, h6h5, g6g5:** These pawn moves don't seem to help.
*   **c7c5, b7b5:** These pawn moves might open the position too much.

The most important thing is to try to block the white queen's attack. I think the best move is to push the e-pawn to e5. This blocks the queen's attack on the king, and it also opens up lines for the bishop on f8.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, I have a lot of options. Let's analyze them.

*   **King moves (e8f8, e8d8, e8e7):** These seem safe, but don't really develop anything.
*   **Rook moves (a8b8, a8a7):** The rook on a8 is currently blocked. Moving it doesn't seem immediately useful.
*   **Pawn moves (h7h8, h7g7, d7d6, c7c6, b7b6, h6h5, g6g5, c7c5, b7b5):** These are all pawn moves. Some advance the pawns, but don't seem to create immediate threats.
*   **Bishop moves (f6h8, f6d8, f6g7, f6e7, f6g5, f6h4):** The bishop on f6 has some interesting options.
*   **Queen moves (e5e7, e5e6, e5d6, e5h5, e5g5, e5f5, e5d5, e5f4, e5e4, e5d4, e5g3, e5e3, e5c3, e5h2, e5e2, e5e1):** The queen is very active and has a lot of potential moves.

The most interesting options seem to be the queen moves and the bishop moves. The queen on e5 is under attack by the pawn on g4, so I need to address that.

I think the best move is to develop the bishop and attack the white queen.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, I have a lot of options. White's attack is the main concern. I need to prioritize defending my King and developing my pieces.

Looking at the moves, I see a few possibilities:

*   **e8f8, e8d8, e8e7:** Moving the King. This is a defensive option, but it might not be the best use of my time.
*   **h7h8, h7g7:** Moving the pawn. Not very helpful right now.
*   **g5...:** Moving the pawn. This could open lines for my pieces, but it also weakens the pawn structure.
*   **e5...:** Moving the pawn. This looks like a good option to challenge the center and develop.
*   **f7f6, d7d6, c7c6, b7b6, h6h5, f7f5, c7c5, b7b5:** Pawn moves. These are mostly passive.

I think the most active and promising move is to challenge the center with my pawn. I'll play **e5e4**. This opens lines for my Queen and Bishop, and it forces White to react.

Alright, I have the list of legal moves. The position is quite open, and White has a strong queen presence. I need to develop my pieces and challenge White's control of the center. I'll focus on developing my pawns and potentially opening lines for my rooks.

I'll move the pawn in front of the queen to challenge the center.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Okay, that's a lot of moves. Let's analyze them.

*   **King moves:** e8f8, e8d8, e8e7, e8d7. Moving the king is generally not a good idea early in the game unless absolutely necessary. The king is safer in the center for now.
*   **Bishop moves:** c8d7, c8b7, c8e6, c8f5, c8g4. The bishop on c8 has some good diagonals. c8f5 looks interesting, attacking the queen.
*   **Rook moves:** a8b8, a8a7, a8a6, a8a5, a8a4, a8a3. The rook on a8 has limited options.
*   **Pawn moves:** h7h8, h7g7, f7f6, c7c6, h6h5, f7f5, c7c5. Pawn moves are important for controlling the center and developing pieces. f7f6 looks like it weakens the king's defense. c7c6 and h6h5 are passive. c7c5 looks like a good developing move, challenging the center.
*   **Queen moves:** g5d8, g5e7, g5f6, g5h4, g5f4, g5e3, g5d2. The queen is well-placed and can attack the center.
*   **e4 moves:** e4e7, e4e6, e4f5, e4e5, e4d5, e4g4, e4f4, e4d4, e4c4, e4b4, e4f3, e4e3, e4d3, e4e2, e4c2, e4e1, e4b1.

Considering the position, I want to develop my pieces and challenge white's control of the center. **c7c5** seems like a good developing move that also challenges the center.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, I have a lot of options. White's attack is the priority. Let's analyze the key threats:

*   **White's Queen:** The Queen on e5 is a major threat.
*   **White's Bishop on f1:** This Bishop is also targeting my King.

I need to find a move that addresses these threats. Moving the King is tempting, but it might not be the best. I see a few options that look interesting:

*   **...Qd8:** This move develops the Queen and defends the King. It also potentially opens up lines for a counterattack.
*   **...Bf5:** This move attacks the Queen and develops the Bishop.

Let's go with the more active approach and develop the Bishop.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, I've got the legal moves. White is clearly trying to put pressure on the Black King. I need to find a move that defends and develops.

*   **e8f8, e8d8, a8d8, a8c8, a8b8, a8a7, a8a6, a8a5, a8a4, a8a3:** These are rook moves. Moving the rook on a8 doesn't seem to immediately address the threats. Moving the King is also not ideal.
*   **h7h8, h7g7:** Pawn moves. Pushing the pawn on h7 doesn't seem to help.
*   **f5c8, f5d7, f5e6, f5g4:** Bishop moves. The Bishop on f5 is a key defender. Moving it away from the defense of the King is risky.
*   **e4e7, e4e6, e4e5, e4d5, e4g4, e4f4, e4d4, e4c4, e4b4, e4a4, e4f3, e4e3, e4d3, e4e2, e4c2, e4e1, e4b1:** Queen moves. The Queen is well-placed.
*   **h6g5, h6h5:** Pawn moves. Pushing the pawn on h6 doesn't seem to help.
*   **f7f6:** This pawn move seems like a good developing move, supporting the defense of the King and potentially opening lines for the Bishop.
*   **c5c4:** This pawn move seems like a good developing move, challenging the center.

I think **f7f6** is the best move here. It supports the King and develops a pawn.

You are a professional chess player and you play as black. Now is your turn to make a move. Before making a move you can pick one of the following actions:
- 'get_current_board' to get the schema and current status of the board
- 'get_legal_moves' to get a UCI formatted list of available moves
- 'make_move <UCI formatted move>' when you are ready to complete your turn (e.g., 'make_move e2e4')

Okay, I see the board. White has a strong attack brewing, especially with the queen on e5. Black's king is a bit exposed. I need to find a move that addresses the immediate threats and develops my pieces. Let's see what moves are available.

h7h8,h7g7,h7f7,e7f7,e7d7,a7a8,a7d7,a7c7,a7b7,a7a6,a7a5,a7a4,a7a3,f5c8,f5d7,f5e6,f5g4,e4e6,e4e5,e4d5,e4g4,e4f4,e4d4,e4c4,e4b4,e4a4,e4f3,e4e3,e4d3,e4e2,e4c2,e4e1,e4b1,h6g5,f6g5,h6h5,c5c4

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, that's a lot of moves. Let's analyze them.

*   **Pawn moves:** `h7h8`, `h7g7`, `h7f7`, `a7a8`, `a7d7`, `a7c7`, `a7b7`, `a7a6`, `a7a5`, `a7a4`, `a7a3`, `c5c4` - These pawn moves are mostly defensive or developing. `h7h8` is a promotion, but it's not immediately helpful. `c5c4` looks interesting to challenge the center.
*   **Bishop moves:** `f5c8`, `f5d7`, `f5e6`, `f5g4` - The bishop on f5 has some potential, but needs to be careful of the queen. `f5e6` seems like a good developing move.
*   **Queen moves:** `e4e6`, `e4e5`, `e4d5`, `e4g4`, `e4f4`, `e4d4`, `e4c4`, `e4b4`, `e4a4`, `e4f3`, `e4e3`, `e4d3`, `e4e2`, `e4c2`, `e4e1`, `e4b1` - The queen has a lot of options, but many of them don't seem to improve the position.
*   **Knight moves:** `h6g5`, `f6g5`, `h6h5` - These knight moves are less impactful.

Considering the threats and the need for development, I think `f5e6` is the best move. It develops the bishop to a more active square, potentially controlling the important d5 square and challenging white's control of the center. It also opens the diagonal for the queen.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, that's a lot of moves! Let's break this down.

*   **Pawn Moves:** The pawn moves are mostly about controlling the center and developing. `c5c4` looks interesting, challenging white's pawn structure.
*   **Bishop Moves:** The bishop on f6 has several options. `e6f7` attacks the white queen, but it's likely defended. `e6d7` is also a possibility.
*   **Queen Moves:** The queen on e4 has a wide range of options.
*   **Knight Moves:** The knight on e6 has a few moves.
*   **Rook Moves:** No rook moves are available.

Considering the position, I want to put pressure on the white queen. Let's try `e6f7`.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, that's a lot of moves. Let's analyze. White's queen on e5 is a major threat. I need to address that. The pawn on f7 is undefended and could be a target.

*   **h7h8=Q, h7h8=R, h7h8=B, h7h8=N:** Promoting the h-pawn to a queen seems tempting, but it doesn't immediately address the threat.
*   **h7g7:** This doesn't help.
*   **f7g8=Q, f7g8=R, f7g8=B, f7g8=N:** Promoting the f-pawn is also not the best option right now.
*   **f7e8=Q, f7e8=R, f7e8=B, f7e8=N:** Promoting the f-pawn is also not the best option right now.
*   **f7e6:** This blocks the queen's attack, but it doesn't develop a piece.
*   **f7d5:** This doesn't help.
*   **e7d7:** This doesn't help.
*   **a7a8=Q, a7a8=R, a7a8=B, a7a8=N:** Promoting the a-pawn is also not the best option right now.
*   **a7d7, a7c7, a7b7, a7a6, a7a5, a7a4, a7a3:** These moves don't help.
*   **e4e6, e4f5, e4e5, e4d5, e4g4, e4f4, e4d4, e4c4, e4b4, e4a4, e4f3, e4e3, e4d3, e4e2, e4c2, e4e1, e4b1:** These are all white's moves.
*   **h6g5:** This doesn't help.
*   **f6g5:** This doesn't help.
*   **h6h5:** This doesn't help.
*   **f6f5:** This doesn't help.
*   **c5c4:** This attacks the pawn on d4 and opens the diagonal for my bishop.

The best move seems to be **c5c4**. It challenges the center and prepares for further development.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, I have a lot of options. Let's analyze them:

*   **Pawn moves:** The pawn moves on the h-file (h7h8, h7g7) are interesting, but promoting the pawn to a Queen right now doesn't seem immediately helpful. The pawn moves on the f-file (f7g8, f7e8, f7e6, f7d5) are also options, but don't seem to improve the situation significantly. The pawn moves on the a-file (a7a8, a7c7, a7b7, a7a6, a7a5, a7a4, a7a3, a7a2) are not relevant.
*   **Queen moves:** The Queen moves (e4e8, e4e7, e4e6, e4f5, e4e5, e4d5, e4g4, e4f4, e4d4, e4f3, e4e3, e4d3, e4e2, e4c2, e4e1, e4b1) are the most important. The Queen is under attack, and needs to move.
*   **Other moves:** The pawn moves on the h-file (h6g5, h6h5) and f-file (f6g5, f6f5) are not relevant.

The most pressing issue is the Queen being attacked. I need to move the Queen to a safe square. Moving the Queen to e6 seems like a good option. It attacks the white Bishop and defends the King.

Alright, I have a few options. The pawn on f6 is under pressure, and I need to address that. Moving the pawn on f6 to f5 seems like a good defensive move, challenging the center and opening a line for my bishop. Let's make that move.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, I have a lot of options. Let's analyze them:

*   **Pawn moves:** `h7h8`, `h7g7`, `h7h6`, `f7g8`, `f7e8`, `a7a8`, `a7c7`, `a7b7`, `a7a6`, `a7a5`, `a7a4`, `a7a3`, `a7a2`, `e6e8`, `e6e7`, `e6f6`, `e6d6`, `e6e5`, `e6d5`, `e6e4`, `e6e3`, `e6e2`, `e6e1`, `f5g4`, `g6g5`, `f5f4`

    *   `h7h8`: Promotes the pawn to a queen, but it's immediately attacked by the white queen. Not good.
    *   `h7g7`: Doesn't help much.
    *   `h7h6`: Doesn't help much.
    *   `f7g8`: Promotes the pawn to a queen, but it's immediately attacked by the white queen. Not good.
    *   `f7e8`: Promotes the pawn to a queen, but it's immediately attacked by the white queen. Not good.
    *   `a7a8`: Promotes the pawn to a queen, but it's immediately attacked by the white queen. Not good.
    *   `a7c7`, `a7b7`, `a7a6`, `a7a5`, `a7a4`, `a7a3`, `a7a2`: Doesn't help much.
    *   `e6e8`, `e6e7`: Doesn't help much.
    *   `e6f6`, `e6d6`: Doesn't help much.
    *   `e6e5`: This looks interesting. It challenges the center and opens lines for my pieces.
    *   `e6d5`: Doesn't help much.
    *   `e6e4`, `e6e3`, `e6e2`, `e6e1`: Doesn't help much.
    *   `f5g4`: Doesn't help much.
    *   `g6g5`: Doesn't help much.
    *   `f5f4`: Doesn't help much.

I think `e6e5` is the best move here. It challenges the center and opens lines for my pieces.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Okay, I've got a lot of options. Let's analyze them.

*   **Pawn moves:** h7h6 looks like a good developing move, and it prevents a potential Queen check on h7. f7e6, f7d5, and f5f4 are also interesting pawn moves.
*   **e5 moves:** The e5 pawn has a lot of options, but most of them don't seem to help much.
*   **g6 moves:** g6g5 is a possibility, but it weakens the kingside.
*   **a7 moves:** a7a6, a7a5, a7a4, a7a3, a7a2, a7a8, a7c7, a7b7 are not good moves.

I think the best move here is to develop the pawn and protect the king.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Okay, that's a lot of moves. Let's analyze them.

*   **Rook moves (a7):** The rook on a7 has many options, but moving it doesn't seem to immediately address the threat of White's queen.
*   **Pawn moves (f7):** f7-g8 is a promotion, but it's not a good idea to promote to a queen right now. f7-e8 is also a promotion. f7-e6, f7-d5 are pawn moves.
*   **Pawn moves (h6):** h6-h7, h6-h5 are pawn moves.
*   **Pawn moves (g6):** g6-g5, g6-h5 are pawn moves.
*   **Pawn moves (f5):** f5-f4, f5-g4 are pawn moves.
*   **Pawn moves (e5):** e5-e6, e5-e4, e5-d6, e5-d5, e5-f6, e5-f4, e5-g7, e5-g3, e5-h8, e5-h2, e5-e7, e5-e3, e5-e2, e5-e1, e5-c3, e5-d4, e5-e8 are pawn moves.

The most pressing issue is the threat to the black king. I need to find a move that develops a piece and defends the king. The pawn on f7 is a good option.

I will move the pawn on f7 to e6. This blocks the queen's attack and opens a diagonal for the bishop.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, I've got a lot of options. Let's analyze them.

*   **Pawn moves:** `d7d6`, `h6h8`, `h6h7`, `h6h5`, `g6g5`, `f5f4`. These are mostly defensive, but some might open lines for my pieces.
*   **Bishop moves:** `e6g8`, `e6f7`, `e6d5`. The bishop on e6 is important for defense.
*   **Queen moves:** `e5h8`, `e5g7`, `e5f6`, `e5d6`, `e5d5`, `e5f4`, `e5e4`, `e5d4`, `e5g3`, `e5e3`, `e5c3`, `e5h2`, `e5e2`, `e5e1`. The queen is very active and can be used to attack or defend.
*   **Pawn promotion:** `a7a8`, `a7c7`, `a7b7`, `a7a6`, `a7a5`, `a7a4`, `a7a3`, `a7a2`. This is not immediately relevant.
*   **Pawn moves:** `g6h5`, `f5g4`. These are not very useful.

The most critical threat is the white queen. I need to defend my king and develop my pieces.

I see a few promising moves. `e6d5` looks interesting, as it develops my bishop and attacks the white queen. However, it might be a trap. `e5f6` is also a good move as it defends the king and attacks the white queen.

I'll go with `e5f6`. It defends my king and forces the white queen to move.

Okay, I see the board. White has a significant material advantage, with two queens and a rook up. Black's king is also somewhat exposed. I need to find a move that minimizes the damage and tries to create some counterplay. Let's see what legal moves I have.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, I've got a list of legal moves. White is clearly threatening to checkmate me. I need to find a move that addresses the immediate threats and tries to create some breathing room.

*   **f7g8, f7f8, f7e8:** These are pawn promotions. Promoting to a queen is likely bad because of the material disadvantage. Promoting to a knight might be interesting to create some threats.
*   **f7h7, f7g7, f7e7, f7f6:** These are pawn moves that don't seem to help much.
*   **d7c7, a7a8, a7c7, a7b7, a7a6, a7a5, a7a4, a7a3, a7a2:** These are pawn moves that don't seem to help much.
*   **h6h8, h6h7, h6h5:** These are pawn moves that don't seem to help much.
*   **e6d5:** This pawn move might open up lines for my bishop.
*   **g6h5, f5g4, g6g5, f5f4:** These are pawn moves that don't seem to help much.

The most promising move seems to be promoting the pawn on f7 to a knight. This creates a threat and might complicate the position enough to give me a chance. Let's try that.

Okay, I have the list of legal moves. The most pressing issue is the threat to the black king. White's queen on g8 is a major threat. I need to find a move that addresses this.

*   **g8h8, g8f8, g8e8, g8d8, g8c8, g8b8, g8a8:** These are queen moves, but they don't address the immediate threat.
*   **g8h7, g8g7, g8f7:** These are queen moves, but they don't address the immediate threat.
*   **d7e8, d7d8, d7c8, d7c7:** These are pawn moves. None of them seem to help.
*   **a7a8, a7c7, a7b7, a7a6, a7a5, a7a4, a7a3, a7a2:** These are pawn moves. None of them seem to help.
*   **e6f7, e6d5:** These are pawn moves. None of them seem to help.
*   **g6h5, g6g5:** These are pawn moves. None of them seem to help.
*   **f5g4, f5f4:** These are pawn moves. None of them seem to help.

It seems like there is no immediate defense against the queen. The best I can do is to try to develop a piece and create some counterplay. I will move the pawn on f5 to f4. This opens up a diagonal for the bishop.

*   **g8h8, g8f8, g8e8, g8d8, g8c8, g8b8, g8a8:** Moving the queen doesn't immediately address the threat.
*   **g8h7, g8g7, g8f7:** Moving the queen to g7 is not possible because the square is occupied by the white queen.
*   **d7e8, d7c8, d7e7, d7d6:** Moving the pawn doesn't help the king.
*   **a7a8, a7c7, a7b7, a7a6, a7a5:** Moving the pawn doesn't help the king.
*   **e6f7, e6f5, e6d5, e6g4:** Moving the bishop doesn't help the king.
*   **g6h5, g6g5:** Moving the pawn doesn't help the king.

The best move is to move the queen to h8 to defend the king.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, I have the legal moves. White's threats are serious. The most immediate danger is the attack on the Black King. I need to prioritize defense.

*   **h8g8, h8f8, h8e8, h8d8, h8h7, h8g7, h8h6, h8f6, h8e5, h8d4, h8c3:** These are Queen moves. Some of them are defensive, but they don't seem to address the immediate threats.
*   **d7e8, d7d8, d7c8, d7d6:** These are pawn moves. d7d6 looks like it might help a little, but it doesn't solve the problem.
*   **a7a8, a7c7, a7b7, a7a6, a7a5, a7a4, a7a3, a7a2:** These are pawn moves. Useless.
*   **e6g8, e6f7, e6f5, e6d5, e6g4:** These are Bishop moves. The Bishop on e6 is the key to the defense. e6f5 looks interesting, attacking the white knight.
*   **g6h5, g6g5:** These are pawn moves. Useless.

The best move seems to be **e6f5**. This attacks the White Knight, potentially forcing it to move and relieving some pressure. It also opens a diagonal for the Bishop.

Okay, I've got the legal moves. The most pressing threat is the white queen. I need to address it.

*   **d7e8, d7d8, d7c8:** These are queen moves. Capturing the queen is tempting, but it's likely a trap.
*   **d7d6:** This move blocks the queen's attack on the king and develops the pawn.
*   **a7a8, a7c7, a7b7, a7a6, a7a5, a7a4, a7a3, a7a2:** These are pawn moves.
*   **h6h8, h6f8, h6h7, h6g7, h6h5, h6g5:** These are pawn moves.
*   **f5e6, f5g4, f5e4, f5d3, f5c2:** These are bishop moves.
*   **g6h5, g6g5:** These are pawn moves.

The most promising move seems to be **d7d6**. It defends the king and opens up the diagonal for the bishop on f5.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, I've got a list of legal moves. The most pressing issue is the attack on my King. I need to find a move that either defends the King directly or creates a counter-attack that forces White to address a different threat.

Looking at the moves, I see that moving the pawn on h6 to h5 seems like a reasonable defensive move. It blocks the potential check from the White Bishop on f1.

Therefore, I will make the move h6h5.

*   **...d6d5:** This challenges the center and opens the diagonal for my bishop.

I think the most forcing move is to attack the queen.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Okay, I have the legal moves. Let's analyze them.

*   **Pawn moves:** a7 can move to a8, a6, a5, a4, a3, a2, a7 can promote to a8. d6 can move to d7, c5. e4 can move to f5, d5, f3, d3, c2. g6 can move to h5, g5.

The most pressing issue seems to be the threat to the black king. White's rook on h4 is a potential threat. I need to consider moves that address this.

*   **d6d7:** This doesn't seem to help much.
*   **e4f5:** This doesn't help.
*   **g6g5:** This doesn't help.
*   **a7a8:** This is a promotion, but to what? It doesn't seem to address the immediate threat.

I need to find a move that develops a piece and potentially defends against the threat.

Let's consider the pawn moves again. The pawn on e4 is blocking the bishop on f5. Moving the pawn on g6 to g5 opens up the g-file, but doesn't immediately help.

I think the best move here is to move the pawn on g6 to g5. This opens up the g-file and potentially allows the king to escape.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, I have a few options. The pawn on d6 has several moves. The bishop on e4 has many moves. Let's analyze the pawn moves first.

*   **d6d7:** This advances the pawn, but doesn't immediately threaten anything.
*   **d6c7:** This captures a pawn, but also opens up the diagonal for the white bishop.
*   **d6e6:** This is a more aggressive pawn advance.
*   **d6d5:** This challenges the center.
*   **d6c5:** This captures a pawn, but opens the diagonal for the white bishop.

Now let's look at the bishop moves.

*   **e4a8:** This captures the rook, but the rook is defended by the king.
*   **e4h7:** This attacks the pawn, but it's not a significant threat.
*   **e4b7:** This attacks the pawn, but it's not a significant threat.
*   **e4g6:** This attacks the pawn, but it's not a significant threat.
*   **e4c6:** This attacks the pawn, but it's not a significant threat.
*   **e4f5:** This develops the bishop and attacks the knight.
*   **e4d5:** This develops the bishop and attacks the center.
*   **e4f3:** This attacks the pawn, but it's not a significant threat.
*   **e4d3:** This attacks the pawn, but it's not a significant threat.
*   **e4c2:** This attacks the pawn, but it's not a significant threat.

I think the best move here is to develop the bishop and attack the knight.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Okay, I have the legal moves. Let's analyze them.

*   **Pawn moves:** `d6d7`, `d6c7`, `d6e5`, `d6d5`, `d6c5` - These pawn moves don't seem to help much. `d6d7` is blocked. The others don't immediately address the threats.
*   **Pawn moves:** `a6a8`, `a6a7`, `a6c6`, `a6b6`, `a6a5`, `a6a4`, `a6a3`, `a6a2` - These pawn moves are not helpful.
*   **Bishop moves:** `f5c8`, `f5h7`, `f5d7`, `f5g6`, `f5e6`, `f5g4`, `f5e4`, `f5d3`, `f5c2` - The bishop on f5 has some interesting options. `f5c8` attacks the rook. `f5h7` attacks the pawn.
*   **Pawn moves:** `f4f3` - This pawn move is not helpful.

Considering the position, the most promising move seems to be to attack the rook with the bishop.

Okay, I've got the legal moves. Let's analyze them.

*   **d7e8, d7c8:** These are bishop moves. They don't seem to immediately improve the position.
*   **d7e6, d7c6, d7f5, d7b5, d7g4:** These are also bishop moves. Some of them might be interesting, but I need to be careful about leaving my king vulnerable.
*   **a6a8, a6a7, a6h6, a6g6, a6f6, a6e6, a6d6, a6c6, a6b6, a6a5, a6a4, a6a3, a6a2:** These are pawn moves. Pushing the pawn on a6 might be useful to create some space, but it doesn't seem to be a priority right now.
*   **d5c5, d5c4:** These are pawn moves.

Considering the position, I think I should try to activate my bishop and potentially create some pressure. The move **d7e6** looks like a reasonable option. It develops the bishop to a more active square and potentially eyes some squares that could be useful later.

Okay, I see the legal moves. The bishop on f7 has a lot of options. I need to consider the threats and try to improve my position.

*   **f7g8**: This promotes the bishop to a queen, but it doesn't address the immediate threats and leaves the king exposed.
*   **f7e8**: This also promotes the bishop to a queen, but it doesn't address the immediate threats and leaves the king exposed.
*   **f7g6**: This develops the bishop and attacks the knight on h5. This seems like a reasonable developing move that also creates a threat.
*   **f7e6**: This develops the bishop, but doesn't create any immediate threats.
*   **f7h5**: This attacks the knight on h5, but it doesn't develop the bishop to a good square.
*   **f7d5**: This develops the bishop, but it doesn't create any immediate threats.
*   **f7c4**: This develops the bishop and attacks the pawn on b2, but it doesn't seem to be the best move.
*   **c5c4**: This moves the pawn, but it doesn't seem to be the best move.

**f7g6** looks like the best move. It develops the bishop, attacks a knight, and prepares for further development.

Now, let's get the legal moves.

Okay, I see the legal moves. My bishop on g7 can move to e8, h7, f7, h5, f5, or e4. My pawn on c5 can move to c4.

The move c5c4 looks interesting, challenging the center. However, it opens up the diagonal for the white bishop.

Let's consider the bishop moves.
*   **g6e8:** This develops the bishop and attacks the rook on h2. This seems like a good developing move.
*   **g6h7:** This doesn't seem to achieve much.
*   **g6f7:** This doesn't seem to achieve much.
*   **g6h5:** This attacks the knight on d4.
*   **g6f5:** This attacks the pawn on f5.
*   **g6e4:** This attacks the knight on d4, but also opens up the diagonal for the white bishop.

I think the best move is to develop the bishop to e8, attacking the rook.

*   **c5b6:** This is a move with the black pawn on c5.

The bishop moves look like they are trying to develop the bishop, but they don't seem to have any immediate tactical impact. The pawn move, c5b6, looks interesting. It attacks the white pawn on a2.

I think the best move is to develop the bishop and put pressure on the white pieces. I'll move the bishop to f7.

Okay, I have a few options.

*   **g6e8:** This moves the bishop to the back rank, which doesn't seem particularly useful right now.
*   **g6h7:** This develops the bishop, but it's a passive move.
*   **g6f7:** This develops the bishop and attacks the pawn on e5.
*   **g6h5:** This develops the bishop, but it's a passive move.
*   **g6f5:** This develops the bishop and attacks the knight on e4.
*   **g6e4:** This develops the bishop and attacks the knight on e4.
*   **c5b6:** This moves the pawn.

I think the most active moves are to develop the bishop and attack the knight. Both g6f5 and g6e4 do this. However, g6e4 also opens a diagonal for the bishop to attack the king.

I'll choose g6e4.

You are a professional chess player and you play as black. Now is your turn to make a move. Before making a move you can pick one of the following actions:
- 'get_current_board' to get the schema and current status of the board
- 'get_legal_moves' to get a UCI formatted list of available moves
- 'make_move <UCI formatted move>' when you are ready to complete your turn (e.g., 'make_move e2e4')

Okay, I'm ready to analyze the position. First, I need to see the current board state.

Okay, I see the board. White has a significant material advantage, but the position is complex. My king is relatively safe for now. I need to assess the immediate threats and then look for active possibilities.

I'll start by getting the legal moves to see what options I have.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Okay, I see the legal moves. The most interesting ones seem to be the pawn moves.

I'll analyze the pawn moves.
*   **d5d6**: This seems like a reasonable move, challenging the white pawn.
*   **d5c4**: This is a capture, but it doesn't seem to gain much.
*   **e4h7**: This is a knight move.
*   **e4g6**: This is a knight move.
*   **e4f5**: This is a knight move.
*   **e4f3**: This is a knight move.
*   **e4d3**: This is a knight move.
*   **e4g2**: This is a knight move.
*   **e4h1**: This is a knight move.

I think the best move is to challenge the white pawn.

I will move the king to d6.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Okay, I have a few options. Let's analyze them:

*   **e4h7, e4g6, e4f5, e4f3, e4d3, e4g2, e4h1:** These are all moves with the Bishop. The Bishop on e4 is currently attacking the pawn on f5. Moving the Bishop away seems like a reasonable option to avoid losing the Bishop.
*   **d5e6, d5c6, d5c4:** These are all moves with the pawn on d5.

Considering the position, I think the best move is to move the Bishop to f3 to attack the Knight.

Okay, I have the legal moves. The bishop on f3 has a lot of options. The king on d3 also has a few.

Let's consider the options. Moving the bishop to a8, b7, c6, d5, g4, e4, g2, e2, h1, or d1 all seem like they don't immediately improve my position. Moving the king to e4, c4, e3, or c3 also doesn't seem to be the best option.

However, I see that the white rook on h7 is undefended. I can move my bishop to e2 to attack the rook.

Therefore, I will move the bishop to e2.

Okay, I see the board. White has a knight on a8, pawns on a7, a6, f5, g5, and the king on e6, a bishop on f6, and rooks on a1 and h1. Black has a king on d6 and a pawn on a5.

Now, I need to see what moves are available to me.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Okay, I see the legal moves. It looks like the previous response provided moves for a piece that doesn't exist on the board. Based on the current board state, the only legal moves are for the black king. The legal moves for the black king are: Kd5, Kc5, Kc7, Ke7, Ke5, Kc6, Kd7.

I will move the king to d5.

Alright, I have the list of legal moves. I'll start by considering the most common and solid opening principles. I want to develop my pieces, control the center, and avoid any immediate weaknesses.

The moves `...e7e6` and `...d7d6` are solid and prepare for further development. `...g7g6` and `...b7b6` are also reasonable, but I prefer to develop towards the center.

I'll choose to play `...e7e6`. This supports the development of the queen and bishop and helps control the center.

Alright, I have a list of legal moves. Let's consider the options.

*   **Pawn moves:** I have a lot of pawn moves available. Pushing pawns in the center is often a good idea.
*   **Knight moves:** The knight on f6 has several options.
*   **Bishop moves:** The bishop on f8 has several options.
*   **Queen moves:** The queen has several options.
*   **King moves:** The king has one option.
*   **Rook moves:** The rooks have no moves.

I think I'll start by developing a pawn and controlling the center. I'll move the pawn in front of the king.

*   **Developing the Knight (b8c6 or b8a6):** These are also standard developing moves.
*   **Pushing a pawn (h7h6, g7g6, etc.):** These are more positional moves, and can help control the center.
*   **e6e5 or d6d5:** These are more aggressive moves that challenge the center.

I think I will develop my Queen's Bishop to e7. This move develops a piece, controls some important squares, and prepares for potential future actions.

*   **Pawn moves:** Pawns on the 7th rank have a lot of options.
*   **King moves:** The king on e8 has a few options.

The position is relatively open. White has a strong center. I need to develop my pieces and challenge white's control. I think developing the knight to c6 is a good developing move. It controls central squares and prepares to challenge white's center.

Alright, I have a good list of moves. Let's analyze. White's queen is a threat, and I need to develop my pieces and defend my king.

I see a few reasonable options. Moving the rook on h8 doesn't seem immediately helpful. Moving the queen to c8 looks like a good developing move, putting pressure on the center and potentially connecting my rooks. Moving the pawn on h7 or g7 doesn't seem to do much. Moving the pawn on e6 or d6 seems premature.

I think the best move here is to develop my queen.

Alright, I have a good list of moves. Let's analyze them.

*   **Queen moves (h8g8, h8f8, e8f8, e8d8, c8d8, c8b8, a8b8, e8g8):** The queen is currently well-placed. Moving the queen now doesn't seem to immediately improve the position.
*   **Bishop moves (e7f8, e7d8):** These moves don't seem to be particularly helpful at this moment.
*   **Knight moves (f6g8, f6h5, f6d5, f6g4, f6e4, c6d8, c6b8, c6e5, c6a5, c6d4, c6b4):** The knight on f6 has a lot of options. The knight on c6 also has a lot of options.
*   **Pawn moves (h7h6, g7g6, b7b6, a7a6, e6e5, d6d5, h7h5, g7g5, b7b5, a7a5):** Pawn moves are generally less impactful at this stage, but can be useful for controlling space.

Considering the position, I think I want to develop my knight and challenge the center. **...Nf6-d5** looks like a good move. It attacks the center, and potentially opens up lines for the queen and bishop.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, I've got a lot of options. White's queen and bishop on d4 are eyeing my kingside. I need to develop and defend.

*   **h7h6** and **g7g6** are passive and don't really help.
*   **f7f6** is also passive.
*   **b7b6** and **a7a6** are also not very active.
*   **e6e5** is interesting, but opens up the position too much too early.
*   **h7h5**, **g7g5**, **f7f5**, **b7b5**, and **a7a5** are all pawn pushes that don't seem to address the immediate threats.
*   Moving the queen is tempting, but doesn't seem to improve my position.
*   Moving the bishop is also not ideal at the moment.

I think the best move is to develop my knight and challenge the center. **c6d4** looks like a good move. It attacks the white bishop and opens up the position for my pieces.

*   **Development:** I need to develop my pieces. The bishop on f8 is currently blocked.
*   **Defense:** I need to defend against white's potential threats.

Considering these factors, I'll move my king to f8.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Okay, I have a lot of options. White is putting pressure on the e-file, so I need to be careful.

*   **Developing the Queen's Bishop:** `c8e8` or `c8d8` look tempting to develop the bishop, but they don't immediately address the threats.
*   **Pawn Moves:** Pushing pawns like `h7h6`, `g7g6`, `f7f6`, `c7c6`, `b7b6`, `a7a6` are all reasonable to control space and prepare for defense. `e6e5` is also an option to challenge the center.
*   **Bishop Moves:** `d5f6`, `d5b6`, `d5f4`, `d5b4`, `d5e3`, `d5c3` are all possible bishop moves.
*   **Rook Moves:** `h8g8`, `f8g8`, `f8e8`, `a8b8` are possible rook moves.

I think the most pressing issue is the potential attack on the e-file. I need to develop and defend. I'll develop my queen's bishop to d8 to defend the e-file and prepare for future development.

Alright, I have a lot of options. White's queen on d3 is a threat, and I need to develop my pieces and control the center. I see a few possibilities.

*   **...d7-d5:** This challenges white's control of the center and opens the position for my pieces.
*   **...e7-e5:** This is another central push, but it might leave my king a little exposed.
*   **...c7-c5:** This also challenges the center and prepares to develop my queen's bishop.

I think ...d7-d5 is the most principled move. It directly challenges white's central control and opens lines for my pieces.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

That's a lot of options! Let's analyze. White's queen is a threat, and I need to develop my pieces and defend. The most pressing issue is the potential attack on my king. I need to consider moves that address this.

*   **Developing the Queen's Bishop:** Moves like ...Bg8 or ...Bf6 look tempting, but don't immediately address the threat.
*   **Pawn Moves:** ...h6, ...g6, ...f6, ...c6, ...b6, ...a6 are all passive and don't help develop or defend.
*   **...e6 or ...e5:** These moves look interesting to control the center and potentially open lines for my pieces. However, ...e6 doesn't immediately address the threat. ...e5 is a more active move.
*   **...d6:** This move is not available.

Considering the position, I'll play **...e6** to support the defense of my king and prepare for further development.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, I have a lot of options. Let's analyze.

*   **Queen moves:** The queen on d8 has many options, but none immediately threaten anything critical. Moving it to a more active square is a good idea.
*   **Pawn moves:** Pushing pawns can control the center and open lines.
*   **Bishop moves:** The bishop on f8 has a few options, but none are immediately impactful.
*   **Rook moves:** The rooks on a8 and h8 have limited options.
*   **King moves:** The king is safe for now.

The position feels a bit closed. I think I should try to open it up a bit. Pushing the e-pawn seems like a good idea to challenge the center.

I'll move the e-pawn.

Alright, I've got a lot of options. Let's think this through. White's queen is a threat, and I need to develop my pieces. The pawn structure is relatively locked, so I need to be careful about pushing pawns too early.

*   **Queen moves:** Moving the queen is tempting, but it could expose her.
*   **Pawn moves:** Pushing pawns can open lines, but also weaken my position.
*   **Bishop moves:** The bishop on f8 has limited options.
*   **Rook moves:** The rooks are currently passive.
*   **King moves:** The king is safe for now.

I'm going to develop my knight to a more active square. I'll move the knight on e7 to f5, attacking the pawn on d4 and controlling a key central square.

Okay, I've got the legal moves. White's queen is a major threat. I need to find a move that defends against the immediate threats and develops my pieces.

Let's analyze some options:

*   **...Qg8:** This defends the king and develops the queen.
*   **...Qd7:** This also defends the king and develops the queen, but it might be slightly less active.
*   **...h6:** This prevents a potential white attack on the h-file.
*   **...f6:** This supports the e-pawn and prepares to challenge the center.
*   **...d5:** This challenges the center and opens lines for my pieces.

Considering the position, I think **...Qd7** is the best move. It defends the king, develops the queen to a more active square, and prepares for further development.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, I have a lot of options. The queen on d7 is very active. Let's consider a few possibilities.

*   **Qxc8:** Capturing the rook on c8 seems tempting, but it might open up the position too much for white.
*   **Qxc6:** This attacks the knight on c6 and could lead to a favorable exchange.
*   **Qd5:** This attacks the pawn on e4 and puts pressure on the center.
*   **...h6/g6/f6/b6/a6:** These pawn moves are passive, but they can help to solidify the position.
*   **...h5/g5/f5/b5/a5:** These pawn moves are more aggressive, but they could weaken the pawn structure.

I think the most active move is to attack the center and put pressure on white. I will move my queen to d5.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Okay, I have a lot of options. Let's analyze them.

*   **King moves:** `h8g8` is a possibility, but it doesn't really improve the king's safety.
*   **Queen moves:** The queen has a lot of options, but I don't want to move it just yet.
*   **Rook moves:** I can move the rook, but I don't see any immediate tactical opportunities.
*   **Bishop moves:** The bishops have some options, but they are not immediately useful.
*   **Pawn moves:** I have a lot of pawn moves.

I think the best move is to develop the pawn in front of the king to create a little more space and potentially open the h-file for the rook.

Okay, I have the legal moves. White is threatening to push their pawns and open up my king. I need to be careful.

Let's analyze some of the options:

*   **...h8g8:** Moving the rook doesn't seem to help much.
*   **...f8f7:** This defends the pawn on f6, which is good.
*   **...d7c6:** This develops the queen, but it might be a bit passive.
*   **...f4f5:** This attacks the white pawn and potentially opens up the position.
*   **...g7g6:** This supports the pawn on f6 and prepares to fianchetto the bishop.
*   **...b7b6:** This supports the pawn on a6.
*   **...a7a6:** This supports the pawn on a5.
*   **...f6f5:** This attacks the white pawn and potentially opens up the position.
*   **...g7g5:** This is a more aggressive pawn push.

I think the most solid move is to defend the pawn on f6 and prepare for the future. I'll play ...f8f7.

Alright, I've got a lot of options. Let's analyze this. White seems to have a slight space advantage, and their pieces are relatively well-developed. My queen is a bit passive on d8. I need to find a move that develops a piece, improves my position, and doesn't leave me vulnerable.

I see a few possibilities. Moving the queen seems premature. Pushing pawns can be useful, but I need to be careful not to weaken my position.

Let's consider developing the knight on f4. Moving it to d3 seems interesting. It attacks the pawn on c5 and opens the diagonal for the bishop on c8.

Therefore, I will move the knight from f4 to d3.

Okay, I have a lot of options. Let's analyze the position a bit. White seems to have a slight space advantage. Black's queen is active, but potentially vulnerable. I need to develop my pieces and challenge White's control of the center.

I see a few candidate moves:

*   **...d7d5:** This challenges the center and opens lines for my pieces.
*   **...e6d5:** This also challenges the center and potentially opens the position.
*   **...g7g6:** This supports the kingside and prepares for possible development.

I think ...d7d5 is the most principled move. It directly challenges White's central control.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

You are absolutely right! I apologize for the illegal move. I misread the board. The pawn on d7 is blocked.

Let's re-evaluate. ...g7g6 looks like a solid developing move, preparing for kingside development. It also prevents any potential weaknesses on the g-file.

Okay, that's a lot of moves. Let's analyze the most critical ones. White is clearly trying to exploit the open h-file.

*   **h8g8, h8f8, h8e8:** Moving the rook doesn't seem to help much against the immediate threats.
*   **d8g8, d8f8, d8e8, d8c8, d8b8, d8a8:** Moving the queen is also not immediately helpful.
*   **f7g8, f7f8, f7e8, f7g7:** Moving the pawn doesn't help.
*   **e7f8, d7e8, d7c8, d7c7, d7c6, d7b5, d7a4:** Moving the pawn doesn't help.
*   **e6f5, e6d5, e6g4, e6c4, e6b3, e6a2:** Moving the bishop is not immediately helpful.
*   **d4c6, d4f5, d4b5, d4f3, d4b3, d4e2, d4c2:** Moving the knight is not immediately helpful.
*   **d3e5, d3c5, d3f4, d3b4, d3f2, d3b2, d3e1, d3c1:** Moving the pawn doesn't help.
*   **b7b6, a7a6, h6h5, g6g5, f6f5, d6d5, b7b5, a7a5:** These pawn moves are slow and don't address the immediate threats.

The most pressing threat is the potential for a checkmate. I need to find a move that defends the king. The best move seems to be to move the queen to defend the king.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, I've got the legal moves. White is clearly putting pressure on the kingside. I need to find a move that defends and develops.

*   **h8g8, h8f8, h8h7:** Moving the rook doesn't immediately solve the problem.
*   **e8g8, e8f8, e8d8, e8c8, e8b8, e8a8:** Moving the king is risky, and doesn't develop anything.
*   **f7g8, f7f8, f7g7:** Moving the bishop doesn't help much.
*   **e7f8, e7d8:** Moving the queen is not a good idea.
*   **d7d8, d7c8, d7c7, d7c6, d7b5, d7a4:** Moving the pawn doesn't help.
*   **e6f5, e6d5, e6g4, e6c4, e6b3, e6a2:** Moving the bishop doesn't help.
*   **d3e5, d3c5, d3f4, d3b4, d3f2, d3b2, d3e1, d3c1:** Moving the knight doesn't help.
*   **b7b6, a7a6, h6h5, g6g5, f6f5, d6d5, b7b5, a7a5:** Pawn moves don't help.

Looking at the position again, the most pressing threat is the potential for a checkmate. I think the best move here is to move the king to safety.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, I have a lot of options. Let's analyze them.

*   **Defensive moves:** I need to consider moves that directly address the threats to my king.
    *   `h8g8`: Moving the rook to g8 doesn't seem to help much.
    *   `h8h7`: This blocks the h-file, which might be useful later, but doesn't address any immediate threats.
    *   `f8g8`: Moving the bishop doesn't seem to help.
    *   `f7g8`: Moving the pawn doesn't seem to help.
    *   `e7d8`: Moving the queen doesn't seem to help.
    *   `d7c7`: Moving the pawn doesn't seem to help.
    *   `d7c6`: Moving the pawn doesn't seem to help.
    *   `d7b5`: Moving the pawn doesn't seem to help.
    *   `d7a4`: Moving the pawn doesn't seem to help.
    *   `e6f5`: Moving the bishop doesn't seem to help.
    *   `e6d5`: Moving the bishop doesn't seem to help.
    *   `e6c4`: Moving the bishop doesn't seem to help.
    *   `e6b3`: Moving the bishop doesn't seem to help.
    *   `e6a2`: Moving the bishop doesn't seem to help.
    *   `d3e5`: Moving the knight doesn't seem to help.
    *   `d3c5`: Moving the knight doesn't seem to help.
    *   `d3f4`: Moving the knight doesn't seem to help.
    *   `d3b4`: Moving the knight doesn't seem to help.
    *   `d3f2`: Moving the knight doesn't seem to help.
    *   `d3b2`: Moving the knight doesn't seem to help.
    *   `d3e1`: Moving the knight doesn't seem to help.
    *   `d3c1`: Moving the knight doesn't seem to help.
    *   `g6f5`: Moving the pawn doesn't seem to help.
    *   `b7b6`: Moving the pawn doesn't seem to help.
    *   `a7a6`: Moving the pawn doesn't seem to help.
    *   `h6h5`: Moving the pawn doesn't seem to help.
    *   `g6g5`: Moving the pawn doesn't seem to help.
    *   `d6d5`: Moving the pawn doesn't seem to help.
    *   `b7b5`: Moving the pawn doesn't seem to help.
    *   `a7a5`: Moving the pawn doesn't seem to help.

*   **Attacking moves:** I need to look for opportunities to create counterplay.

After reviewing the available moves, I think the best move is to move the rook to h7. This blocks the h-file and prepares for a possible counterattack.

Okay, I've got the legal moves. White is definitely putting pressure on the f-file. I need to consider the following:

*   **King Safety:** The king is a bit vulnerable.
*   **Development:** I need to develop my pieces to counterattack.
*   **Defense:** I need to defend against the immediate threats.

Looking at the moves, I think I should develop my queen's bishop to a more active square. The move ...Bf7 seems like a good option. It develops the bishop, defends the g8 square, and prepares to potentially challenge the white bishop on c1.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, I've got a lot of options. Let's analyze the key threats and my possible responses. White's queen on d4 is a major threat. My king is somewhat exposed. I need to consider both defensive and counter-attacking moves.

*   **Pawn Moves:** Many pawn moves are available, but most don't seem to immediately address the threats.
*   **e6-f5:** This looks interesting. It attacks the white knight on d3 and opens a line for my bishop.
*   **d7-d5:** This challenges the center and opens a line for my queen.
*   **d7-c6:** This could be a defensive move, blocking the diagonal of the white bishop.
*   **h6-h5:** This could be a defensive move, blocking the diagonal of the white bishop.

Considering the position, I think the most active and promising move is to challenge the center and open lines for my pieces. I'll play **d7-d5**.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Okay, I have the legal moves again. I apologize for the previous error. Let's analyze again.

*   **h7h8, g7g8, g7f8, g7f7, e7f8, e7d8, d7e8, d7d8, d7c8, d7c7, d7c6, d7b5, d7a4:** These are pawn promotions and pawn moves.
*   **e6f7, e6f5, e6d5, e6c4, e6b3, e6a2:** These are knight moves.
*   **d3e5, d3c5, d3f4, d3b4, d3f2, d3b2, d3e1, d3c1:** These are knight moves.
*   **b7b6, a7a6, h6h5, d6d5, b7b5, a7a5:** These are pawn moves.

The most pressing issue is the attack on my king and the threat of white's queen. I still think the best approach is to try to open lines and create counterplay.

**e6-f5** looks like a good move. It attacks the knight on d3 and opens the diagonal for my bishop.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Okay, I have the list of legal moves. Let's analyze them.

*   **Pawn moves:** h7h8, g7g8, g7f8, g7f7, g7g6, b7b6, a7a6, a7a5. The pawn moves are generally safe, but I need to consider the best development and control of the center.
*   **Queen moves:** d7e8, d7d8, d7c8, d7c7, d7e6, d7c6, d7b5. The queen is a powerful piece, but I need to be careful not to expose it too early.
*   **Bishop moves:** e7f8, e7d8. The bishop on e7 has limited mobility.
*   **Knight moves:** f5g6, f5e6, f5g4, f5e4. The knight on f5 is well-placed.
*   **Other moves:** d3e5, d3c5, d3f4, d3b4, d3f2, d3b2, d3e1, d3c1, h6h5, d6d5. These are White's moves.

Considering the position, I want to develop my pieces and control the center. The pawn on g7 can move to g6, which opens the diagonal for the bishop. The knight on f5 can move to e4, attacking the pawn on d4 and controlling the center.

Let's move the knight to e4.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, I've got a lot of options. White is threatening to promote the pawn on h7, and the queen on d4 is a serious threat. I need to address the immediate dangers.

*   **h7h8=Q** is the most pressing threat. I need to stop it.
*   **...g7g6** prevents the pawn from promoting.
*   **...d6d5** is a good developing move that challenges the center.
*   **...d7c6** is a good developing move that challenges the center.

I think the best move here is to prevent the immediate threat and develop a piece.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, I've got a lot of options. Let's analyze the most critical ones:

*   **h7h8=Q, h7h8=R, h7h8=B, h7h8=N:** Promoting the pawn on h7 is tempting, but it doesn't immediately solve the problems.
*   **d7e6:** This looks like a good developing move, challenging the center.
*   **d7c6:** Another developing move, but less active than d7e6.
*   **e4f3:** This looks interesting, attacking the knight.
*   **g6g7:** This doesn't seem to help much.
*   **h6h5:** This doesn't seem to help much.

The most pressing issue is the attack on the king. I need to try and relieve the pressure. **d7e6** seems like the most promising move. It develops a piece, controls a key square, and potentially opens lines for the queen.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, that's a lot of moves! Let's analyze them.

*   **Pawn moves:** h7h8, h7g7, h7f7, g6g7, g6g5, e5e6, e5g5, e5f5, e5d5, e5c5, e5b5, e5f4, e5d4, e5g3, e5h2, b7b6, a7a6, h6h5, f6f5, d6d5, a7a5. These are mostly defensive or trying to develop.
*   **Knight moves:** e4c6, e4f5, e4d5, e4f3, e4g2, e4h1, d3c5, d3f4, d3b4, d3f2, d3b2, d3e1, d3c1. The knights are well-placed, but some moves look better than others.
*   **Bishop moves:** e7f8, e7d8. These are the only bishop moves.

The immediate threat seems to be the white queen and knight on the kingside. I need to address that.

*   **e5f4** looks interesting. It attacks the knight and opens a line for my queen.
*   **e5d4** also attacks the knight.
*   **h6g5** seems like a good defensive move, protecting the king.
*   **g6g5** also seems like a good defensive move, protecting the king.

I think I'll go with **h6g5**. It directly defends the king and prepares to develop my pawn.

*   **Pawn moves:** `h6h8`, `h6h7`, `h6h5`, `h6h4`, `h6h3`, `g6h7`, `g6g7`, `g6f7`, `e5e6`, `e5f5`, `e5d5`, `e5c5`, `e5b5`, `e5a5`, `e5f4`, `e5d4`, `e5g3`, `e5h2`, `d6d5`, `a7b6`, `a7a6`, `a7a5`, `f6f5`. These are mostly pawn pushes. Some are more useful than others. `h6h7` and `g6g7` are not useful. `a7a5` is a standard pawn advance. `d6d5` is a central pawn push that can open lines.

*   **Bishop moves:** `e7f8`, `e7d8`, `e4c6`, `e4f5`, `e4d5`, `e4f3`, `e4g2`, `d3c5`, `d3f4`, `d3b4`, `d3f2`, `d3b2`, `d3e1`, `d3c1`. The bishops have some mobility, but the board is somewhat closed.

*   **Knight moves:** None

*   **Queen moves:** None

*   **King moves:** None

*   **Rook moves:** None

Considering the position, I think I should try to open the position a bit and challenge white's control of the center. `d6d5` looks like a good move to do this.

`make_move d6d5`

Okay, I have a lot of options. Let's analyze a bit.

*   **Pawn moves:** I have a lot of pawn moves. h6-h5 looks interesting to challenge the rook on h1. e7-e6 looks like a good developing move.
*   **Queen moves:** The queen on e4 has a lot of options, but I don't see any immediate threats.
*   **Knight moves:** The knight on d3 has a few options.
*   **King moves:** The king is relatively safe for now.

I think I'll start with a developing move for my pawn. e7-e6 seems solid.

*   **Bishop moves:** The bishop on e7 has a few options: `e7f8`, `e7d8`, `e7d6`, `e7c5`, `e7b4`, `e7a3`.

*   **Queen moves:** The queen on e4 has many options: `e4f5`, `e4f3`, `e4g2`, `e4h1`, `e5b8`, `e5c7`, `e5e6`, `e5d6`, `e5f5`, `e5f4`, `e5d4`, `e5g3`, `e5h2`.

*   **King moves:** The king on g7 has no moves.

I like the idea of pushing the h-pawn. It could become a threat later. I'll start with `h5h4`.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, I've got a lot of options. Let's analyze them.

*   **Pawn Moves:** The pawn moves seem to be the most numerous.
    *   `e7f8, e7d8`: These are pawn promotions. Promoting to a queen is often best, so these are worth considering.
    *   `e7d6, e7c5, e7b4, e7a3`: These are pawn pushes.
    *   `g6h7, g6g7, g6f7, g6h6`: These are pawn pushes.
    *   `f6f5`: This pawn move looks interesting, challenging the center.
    *   `a7b6, a7a6, a7a5`: These are pawn pushes.

*   **Bishop Moves:**
    *   `e5b8, e5c7, e5e6, e5d6, e5f5, e5f4, e5d4, e5g3, e5h2`: The bishop on e5 has a lot of options.

*   **King Moves:**
    *   `g7g6`: This is a king move.

*   **Other Moves:**
    *   `h4h8, h4h7, h4h6, h4h5, h4g4, h4h3`: These are rook moves.
    *   `e4f5, e4f3, e4g2, e4h1`: These are queen moves.
    *   `d3c5, d3f4, d3b4, d3f2, d3b2, d3e1, d3c1`: These are knight moves.

Considering the position, I want to develop my pieces and challenge white's control of the center. The pawn on f6 looks like a good candidate to advance.

I'll make the move `f6f5`.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Okay, I have a lot of options. Let's analyze them.

*   **Pawn moves:** I have several pawn moves available. `g6h7`, `g6g7`, `g6f7`, `g6h6`, `g6f6`, `a7b6`, `a7a6`, `a7a5`. Pushing the g-pawn seems interesting to challenge the king.

*   **Queen moves:** The queen on e5 has many possible moves. `e5h8`, `e5b8`, `e5g7`, `e5c7`, `e5f6`, `e5e6`, `e5d6`, `e5f4`, `e5d4`, `e5g3`, `e5h2`. The queen is well-placed, but I need to find the most effective move.

*   **Bishop moves:** The bishop on f5 has a few options: `f5g4`, `f5f4`.

*   **Other moves:** `e7f8`, `e7d8`, `e7f6`, `e7d6`, `e7c5`, `e7b4`, `e7a3`, `e4f3`, `e4g2`, `e4h1`, `d3c5`, `d3f4`, `d3b4`, `d3f2`, `d3b2`, `d3e1`, `d3c1`, `h4h8`, `h4h7`, `h4h6`, `h4h5`, `h4g4`, `h4h3`.

Considering the position, I think the most promising move is to attack the king directly. I will move my queen to h2, putting the white king in check.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

That's a lot of moves! Let's analyze.

*   **Pawn moves:** I have a lot of pawn moves. e7f8, e7d8, e7f6, e7d6, e7c5, e7b4, e7a3 are all pawn moves. g6h7, g6g7, g6f7, g6h6, g6f6 are also pawn moves.
*   **Other moves:** h4h8, h4h7, h4h6, h4h5, h4g4, h4h3, e4f3, e4g2, e4h1, d3e5, d3c5, d3f4, d3b4, d3f2, d3b2, d3e1, d3c1, h2b8, h2c7, h2d6, h2e5, h2f4, h2h3, h2g3, h2g2, h2f2, h2e2, h2h1, h2g1, a7b6, f5g4, a7a6, f5f4, a7a5

I need to consider the position of the king, the threats, and potential development. The white queen is a threat. I need to consider how to defend against it.

The most pressing issue is the threat to my king. I need to move my king out of the way.

Let's move the king.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

That's a lot of moves. Let's analyze the position. White seems to have a strong attack, especially with the rook on e5 and the queen on f7. I need to defend and try to create counterplay.

*   **e7f8, e7d8, e7d6, e7c5, e7b4, e7a3:** These are pawn moves. They don't seem to address the immediate threats.
*   **f6g7, f6f7, f6g6, f6e6:** These are pawn moves. They don't seem to address the immediate threats.
*   **h4h8, h4h7, h4h6, h4h5, h4g4, h4h3:** These are pawn moves. They don't seem to address the immediate threats.
*   **e4f3, e4g2, e4h1:** These are knight moves. The knight on e4 is under attack, and moving it seems like a good idea. e4f3 attacks the white bishop on b1.
*   **d3e5, d3c5, d3f4, d3b4, d3f2, d3b2, d3e1, d3c1:** These are knight moves. The knight on d3 is under attack, and moving it seems like a good idea.
*   **h2b8, h2c7, h2d6, h2e5, h2f4, h2h3, h2g3, h2g2, h2f2, h2e2, h2h1, h2g1:** These are rook moves. The rook on h2 is under attack, and moving it seems like a good idea.
*   **a7b6, f5g4, d5c4, a7a6, f5f4, a7a5:** These are pawn moves. They don't seem to address the immediate threats.

The knight on e4 is under attack. Moving it to f3 seems like a reasonable defensive move, attacking the white bishop on b1.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

That's a lot of moves! Let's analyze. The most immediate threat seems to be the white rook on a1. I need to address that. I also need to consider the position of my king.

*   **Defending the Rook:** I don't have any immediate moves to directly defend the rook.
*   **King Safety:** My king is somewhat exposed.
*   **Pawn Structure:** I have a pawn chain on the e-file.

Considering all of this, I think the best move is to develop my queen to a more active square and potentially put pressure on the white king. I'll move my queen to h8.

Okay, I have the legal moves again. The queen is on h2, so I can't move it. My rook on h4 is attacking the g4 pawn. I could move it to h3 to protect the g4 pawn. I could also move my pawn on f5 to f4 to attack the knight on c4. Let's try f5f4.

Okay, I have a lot of options. Let's analyze them.

*   **Pawn moves:** e7f8, e7d8, e7d6, e7c5, e7b4, e7a3, f6g7, f6f7, f6g6, f6e6, h4h8, h4h7, h4h6, h4h5, h4g4, h4h3, a7b6, a7a6, a7a5, d5c4. Pushing the pawns doesn't seem to help much in the current position.
*   **Knight moves:** f3g4, f3e4, f3g2, f3e2, f3h1, f3d1. The knight on f3 is a bit exposed. Moving it doesn't seem to improve the position significantly.
*   **Bishop moves:** d3e5, d3c5, d3b4, d3f2, d3b2, d3e1, d3c1. The bishop on d3 is a key defender. Moving it away would be a mistake.
*   **Rook moves:** h2h3, h2g3, h2g2, h2f2, h2e2, h2d2, h2c2, h2b2, h2h1, h2g1. Moving the rook doesn't seem urgent.

Considering the position, I think I need to try to consolidate my position and develop a piece. The pawn on e7 is a bit weak. I'll move the pawn to defend the bishop on f6.

Okay, I have the legal moves: g6h7, g6g7, g6h6, g6f6, and d3e5.

Let's analyze these moves:

*   **g6h7:** Moving the pawn on g6 to h7. This doesn't seem particularly useful.
*   **g6g7:** Moving the pawn on g6 to g7. This advances the pawn, but doesn't immediately threaten anything.
*   **g6h6:** Moving the pawn on g6 to h6. This doesn't seem to achieve much.
*   **g6f6:** Moving the pawn on g6 to f6. This seems like the most interesting move. It attacks the knight on e4 and opens the diagonal for the bishop on f5.
*   **d3e5:** This is a very interesting move. It attacks the knight on e4 and opens the diagonal for the bishop on f5.

I think the best move here is **g6f6**. It develops a pawn, attacks the knight, and opens the diagonal for the bishop.

Okay, I see the board. White has a strong attack developing. My king is a bit exposed. I need to find a move that addresses the immediate threats and develops my pieces. Let's see what moves are available.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Okay, I have a lot of options. Let's analyze them.

*   **Pawn Moves:** The pawn moves are mostly defensive or developing. `e7f8` is a promotion, but it's not immediately useful. `e7d8` is also a promotion, but not helpful. `e7d6, e7c5, e7b4, e7a3` are all pawn moves that don't seem to improve my position. `f6g7, f6e6` are knight moves. `h4h8, h4h7, h4h6, h4h5, h4g4, h4h3` are pawn moves.
*   **Knight Moves:** `f3g4, f3e4, f3g2, f3e2, f3h1, f3d1` are knight moves.
*   **Bishop Moves:** `d3e5, d3c5, d3b4, d3f2, d3b2, d3e1, d3c1` are bishop moves.
*   **Pawn Moves:** `h2h3, h2g3, h2g2, h2f2, h2e2, h2d2, h2c2, h2b2, h2h1, h2g1` are pawn moves.
*   **Pawn Moves:** `a7b6, a7a6, a7a5` are pawn moves.

The most pressing issue is the potential attack on my king. I need to consider developing a piece to defend. The knight on f3 seems like a good candidate. I could move it to e4, attacking the white pawn on d2 and potentially opening lines for my pieces.

Therefore, I will move the knight from f3 to e4.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, I have a list of legal moves. Let's analyze them.

The most pressing issue is the threat to my king. White's queen on h7 is a serious problem. I need to address this immediately.

Looking at the moves, I see that I can move my pawn from e7 to f8 and promote it to a queen. This will block the check and potentially create a counterattack.

Therefore, my move is e7f8.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Okay, I have a lot of options. Let's analyze them.

*   **...Bg7:** Develops the bishop, but doesn't immediately address any threats.
*   **...Be7:** Develops the bishop, but blocks the pawn on f6.
*   **...Bh6:** Develops the bishop, but it's passive.
*   **...Bd6:** Develops the bishop, but it's passive.
*   **...Bc5:** Attacks the knight, but the knight can move.
*   **...Bb4:** Attacks the rook, but the rook can move.
*   **...Ba3:** A very aggressive move, but the bishop is exposed.
*   **...Kg6:** The king is moving to a safer square.
*   **...Kf7:** The king is moving to a safer square.
*   **...hxg4:** This is a pawn capture, but it opens the h-file.
*   **...Ne5:** Attacks the bishop and opens the diagonal for the queen.
*   **...Nc4:** Attacks the bishop.
*   **...b6:** Supports the pawn structure.
*   **...f3:** This is a pawn capture, but it opens the f-file.
*   **...b5:** Challenges the center.

The most pressing issue is the potential threat on the h-file. I think the best move is to develop the knight to e5, attacking the bishop and opening the diagonal for the queen.

*   **f8h6:** Develops the bishop and attacks the rook. This looks promising.
*   **e4h7:** This doesn't seem to help.
*   **h4h8:** This doesn't seem to help.

I think **f8h6** is the best move. It develops the bishop and attacks the rook, forcing White to react.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Okay, I have a lot of options. Let's analyze them.

*   **Pawn moves:** `h6f8`, `h6g7`, `f6g7`, `f6f7`, `f6e7`, `f6g6`, `f6e6`, `h4h5`, `h4g4`, `h4h3`, `f4f3` - These don't seem to directly address the threats or improve my position significantly. Some might even weaken my pawn structure.
*   **Knight moves:** `e5f7`, `e5d7`, `e5g6`, `e5c6`, `e5g4`, `e5c4`, `e5f3`, `e5d3` - The knight on e5 is a key defender. Moving it away would be risky.
*   **Bishop moves:** `e4h7`, `e4g6`, `e4f5`, `e4f3`, `e4d3`, `e4g2`, `e4c2`, `e4h1`, `e4b1` - The bishop on e4 is also important. Moving it could open lines for white.
*   **Queen moves:** - I don't have a queen on the board.
*   **Rook moves:** - I don't have a rook on the board.
*   **King moves:** - My king is on e8 and has no legal moves.

I need to find a move that defends against the immediate threats. The most pressing threat seems to be the potential attack on my king. I see that the pawn on f6 can move to f7. This move blocks the diagonal of the bishop on g5.

Therefore, I will move my pawn from f6 to f7.

*   **Bishop moves:** The bishop moves (h6f8, h6g7) don't seem to offer immediate tactical advantages.
*   **Knight moves:** The knight moves (e4h7, e4g6, e4f5, e4f3, e4d3, e4g2, e4c2, e4h1, e4b1) are interesting, but the knight is currently well-placed.
*   **Rook moves:** The rook moves (h2h3, h2g3, h2g2, h2f2, h2e2, h2d2, h2c2, h2b2, h2h1, h2g1) are not immediately relevant.

The most pressing concern is the potential threat to the king. I'll play **f7f6** to protect the king.

I need to protect the king. The move f7f6 is illegal. I see that the pawn on f4 can move to f3. This will not protect the king. I need to protect the king. I can move the pawn on d5 to d4. This does not protect the king.

Okay, I see the problem. I was focusing on the rook, but it's the pawn on f7 that is the key. It can promote.

The legal moves for the f7 pawn are f7g8, f7f8, f7e8, f7g7, f7e7, f7g6, and f7e6. Promoting to a queen seems like the best option.

Let's promote the pawn to a queen.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, I have a good list of moves. Let's consider a few options.

*   **Developing the Knights:** `g8f6` and `g8h6` are standard developing moves, but `g8f6` seems more active.
*   **Queen Development:** `e8d7` is a reasonable developing move for the Queen.
*   **Pawn Structure:** `h7h6`, `g7g6`, etc. are solid, but don't immediately challenge anything.
*   **Pawn Advances:** `e7e6` and `d5d4` are interesting.

Considering the position, I think developing the knight to f6 is a good, solid move. It controls central squares and prepares for further development.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, I have a list of legal moves. White seems to be developing a strong attack. I need to be careful. Let's analyze the possibilities.

*   **Pawn moves:** Pushing pawns like h7h6 or g7g6 is a solid, developing move, but doesn't immediately address any threats. e7e6 is also a good developing move.
*   **Knight moves:** ...Nf6-d7 or ...Nf6-h5 don't seem to accomplish much. ...Nf6-e4 could be interesting, attacking the pawn on f2.
*   **Queen moves:** ...Qd8-d7, ...Qd8-d6, ...Qd8-d5 are all possible, but don't seem to improve the position significantly.
*   **King moves:** ...Ke8-d7 is a possibility, but the king is relatively safe in the center for now.
*   **Bishop moves:** ...Bg4-c8, ...Bg4-d7, ...Bg4-e6, ...Bg4-h5, ...Bg4-f5, ...Bg4-h3, ...Bg4-f3 are all possible, but don't seem to improve the position significantly.

Considering the position, I think the best move is to develop my knight and challenge white's control of the center. ...Nf6-e4 looks promising, attacking the f2 pawn and potentially opening lines.

Alright, I have the legal moves. The position is a bit cramped, but I see some options. I think I'll focus on developing my pieces and controlling the center. Moving the queen seems premature, and I don't want to weaken my pawn structure too much right now. I like the idea of developing the knight to a good square. Let's try ...Nc6.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Okay, I have a lot of options. Let's analyze them.

*   **Pawn moves:** Pushing pawns like h7h6, g7g6, f7f6, e7e6, b7b6, a7a6, h7h5, g7g5, f7f5, e7e5, b7b5, a7a5 are all possible, but don't immediately develop any pieces or challenge the center. Some of these could be useful later, but not now.
*   **Knight moves:** The knight on c6 has several options (c6b8, c6e5, c6a5, c6d4, c6b4). c6e5 looks interesting, attacking the pawn on d3 and potentially opening the position. c6d4 is also a possibility, but it might be too passive.
*   **Queen moves:** The queen on d8 has many moves (e8d7, d8c8, d8b8, d8d7, d8d6, d8d5). Moving the queen now seems premature.
*   **Rook moves:** The rooks on a8 and h8 have limited options.
*   **Bishop moves:** The bishop on f8 has limited options.

I think the most active move is to develop my knight to e5, challenging the center and putting pressure on the d3 pawn.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Okay, I have a lot of options. Let's analyze some of the most interesting ones.

*   **Queen moves:** The queen on d8 has many moves. I need to consider how these moves affect the position. Moving to d7 seems like a reasonable developing move.
*   **Pawn moves:** Pushing pawns is also an option. I could push the h-pawn to h6 or h5, the g-pawn to g6 or g5, and so on. These moves can control the center or prepare for an attack.
*   **Other moves:** The other moves are less interesting.

I think developing the queen to d7 is a good developing move. It opens up the diagonal for the bishop on f8 and prepares for further development.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, I have a lot of options. Let's think this through.

*   **Queen moves:** The queen has many options, but moving it too early might expose it.
*   **Pawn moves:** Advancing the pawns is a good way to control the center and create space.
*   **King moves:** The king doesn't have many safe options right now.

I think I'll start by developing a pawn to control the center and prepare for further development. I'll move the pawn in front of the queen.

Alright, I have a lot of options. White's queen on d4 is a threat. I need to address that. I see a few possibilities:

*   **...Qd7:** This develops the queen and defends the pawn on e7. It also prepares to potentially put pressure on the d-file.
*   **...Qg6:** This attacks the white knight on f3 and also develops the queen.
*   **...Qe6:** This develops the queen and attacks the e4 pawn.

I think ...Qd7 is the most solid move, developing the queen to a safe square and defending the e7 pawn. Let's go with that.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Okay, I have a lot of options. Let's analyze them.

*   **Queen moves:** Moving the queen to e8 or c8 doesn't seem to improve the position much.
*   **Knight moves:** The knight on f6 can be developed to e4, g4, c5, or g8. Ne4 attacks the pawn on d4, but it's likely to be attacked by the white knight. Ng4 is also not ideal. Nc5 looks interesting, attacking the pawn on e4 and controlling a key square.
*   **Pawn moves:** Pushing the pawns doesn't seem to help much at this stage.

I think Nc5 is the best move here. It develops the knight, attacks the pawn, and controls a central square.

My apologies. I made a mistake in the move notation. The knight is on f6, so the move should be Nf6c5. Let me try that again.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Okay, I have a lot of options. Let's break this down.

*   **Queen moves:** Qd7 looks like a reasonable developing move, getting the queen off the back rank and potentially eyeing the center.
*   **Knight moves:** Nc6-e5 looks interesting, challenging the center and potentially attacking the pawn on f3. Nc6-d4 is also a possibility.
*   **Pawn moves:** Pushing pawns is always a consideration. h7-h6, g7-g6, f7-f6, e7-e6, b7-b6, and a7-a6 are all solid, but don't immediately impact the position. Pushing pawns further like h7-h5, g7-g5, e7-e5, b7-b5, and a7-a5 are more aggressive, but could weaken my pawn structure.
*   **Bishop moves:** The bishop on f5 has a lot of potential.

Considering the position, I think developing the queen to d7 is a good start. It develops a piece, prepares to challenge the center, and doesn't overextend.

Okay, I see the board. White's king is exposed, and my queen is well-placed. Let's see what tactical opportunities I have. I'll request the legal moves.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, I've got a lot of options. My immediate thoughts are:

*   **Check the King:** I need to look for immediate threats to the white king.
*   **Develop Pieces:** I should also consider developing my pieces to more active squares.

Let's analyze some of the moves.

*   **...Qg8:** This puts the queen on the g-file, but doesn't immediately threaten anything.
*   **...Qe8:** This also doesn't seem to do much immediately.
*   **...Qc8:** This also doesn't seem to do much immediately.
*   **...h6/h5, g6/g5, f6/f5, e6/e5, b6/b5, a6/a5:** These are pawn moves. Some of these could be useful for controlling space or preventing white from advancing, but they don't seem urgent.
*   **...Nf6:** This develops the knight, but doesn't seem to be the most active square.
*   **...Ne5:** This attacks the pawn on f3 and puts the knight in a good position.

I think **...Ne5** is a good developing move that also creates a threat.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Okay, I have a lot of options. Let's analyze a bit.

*   **Pawn moves:** Pushing pawns like h7h6, g7g6, etc. doesn't seem to achieve much immediately. They might be useful later for controlling squares or creating space, but not now.
*   **Queen moves:** Moving the queen (d8e8, d8c8, etc.) is premature. It's better to develop other pieces first.
*   **Bishop moves:** The bishop on f5 has some interesting options. Moving it to g6, e6, g4, e4, h3, d3, c2 could be useful.
*   **Knight moves:** The knight on d5 has a lot of options too.
*   **King moves:** The king cannot move.

I think I'll develop the bishop on f5 to e4. This attacks the knight on f3 and opens up the diagonal for the queen. It also puts some pressure on the center.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, I have a lot of options. Let's analyze them.

*   **King moves:** `h8g8` is the only king move. It doesn't seem to improve the king's safety significantly.
*   **Queen moves:** The queen has a lot of moves, but none of them immediately threaten anything critical.
*   **Bishop moves:** The bishop on f8 has limited options, but it could develop to c5.
*   **Pawn moves:** I have many pawn moves. Pushing the h-pawn or g-pawn doesn't seem to help much. The pawn on d7 can move to d6 or d5, which could challenge the center.
*   **Other pieces:** The knight on d4 is well-placed.

Considering the position, I think I should develop my bishop and challenge white's control of the center. I'll move the bishop to c5.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, a lot of options. The immediate threats seem to be around the black king. Let's consider the most pressing issues.

*   **King Safety:** The king on e7 is somewhat exposed.
*   **Piece Development:** Black needs to develop pieces to counter White's potential attack.

Let's look at some candidate moves:

*   **...h7h6:** This seems like a solid pawn move to protect the g7 pawn and potentially create a flight square for the king.
*   **...d7d6:** This supports the king and prepares to develop the dark-squared bishop.
*   **...d7e6:** This also supports the king and opens up the diagonal for the queen.
*   **...c7c6:** This supports the d5 pawn.

I think the most flexible move is ...h7h6. It doesn't commit to a specific plan and allows me to see how White responds.

*   **Pawn structure:** I don't want to weaken my pawn structure unnecessarily.

Considering the options, I think the best move is to develop the rook to help defend the king.

*   **Queen moves (c8e8, c8d8, c8b8):** Moving the queen might be useful to develop it, but I need to be careful about leaving the king exposed.
*   **Rook moves (g8h8, a8b8):** These moves don't seem particularly helpful at the moment.
*   **Pawn moves:** The pawn moves are mostly defensive.

Considering the position, I think I need to try to consolidate my position and develop my pieces. The move **c7c6** seems like a solid, defensive move. It supports the king and prepares to develop the queen.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, I've got a lot of options. Let's analyze them. The immediate threats seem to be from the white knights and bishops. The black king is relatively safe for now. I want to develop my pieces and control the center.

*   **c7** looks like a good developing move, controlling the center.
*   **g6** and **f6** are also good pawn moves to support the center.
*   **e6** is another option.

I'll choose **c7** to develop my queen.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, that's a lot of moves to consider. White's queen on d4 is a major threat. I need to find a move that either defends against it or develops a counter-attack.

*   **Queen moves:** The queen on c7 has several options. Moving it to d8, b8, or a5 doesn't seem to help much. Moving it to c8 is also not ideal. Moving it to d7 seems like a good defensive move, blocking the queen's attack on the king.
*   **Pawn moves:** Pushing pawns doesn't seem to help much in the short term.
*   **Other pieces:** The knight on e5 has a lot of moves, but none seem to immediately alleviate the pressure.

I think the best move here is to defend the king with the queen.

*   **e6f6:** This doesn't seem to help much.
*   **d7c7:** This blocks the queen's diagonal, but doesn't develop a piece.
*   **g7g6:** This supports the kingside, but doesn't develop.
*   **f7f6:** This also supports the kingside, but doesn't develop.
*   **d5f6:** This attacks the knight, but it's not a good trade.
*   **d5b6:** This develops the bishop and attacks the knight. This looks like a good developing move.

I'll go with **d5b6**.

Okay, I've got a lot of options. Let's analyze them.

*   **King moves:** Moving the King is not ideal at this stage.
*   **Rook moves:** Moving the Rook doesn't seem to help much right now.
*   **Queen moves:** The Queen is well-placed for now.
*   **Bishop moves:** The Bishop on f8 has limited options.
*   **Knight moves:** The Knight on e5 has some interesting possibilities.
*   **Pawn moves:** Pawn moves are important for controlling the center and developing pieces.

Considering the position, I think I should focus on developing my pieces and improving my King's safety. The pawn on g7 can move to g6, which can help protect the King. The knight on e5 has some interesting moves, but I'm not sure if they are the best.

I'll move the pawn on g7 to g6 to help protect the King.

You are a professional chess player and you play as black. Now is your turn to make a move. Before making a move you can pick one of the following actions:
- 'get_current_board' to get the schema and current status of the board
- 'get_legal_moves' to get a UCI formatted list of available moves
- 'make_move <UCI formatted move>' when you are ready to complete your turn (e.g., 'make_move e2e4')

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, I've got a lot of options. Let's analyze the position. White's queen is a threat, and my king is somewhat exposed. I need to develop my pieces and try to control the center.

The move ...Qd8 looks like a good developing move, getting my queen off the back rank and potentially eyeing the center. It also defends the pawn on d6.

Therefore, I will make the move Qd8.

Okay, I see the board. Black's king is in a somewhat exposed position. White has a strong pawn structure in the center and a potential attack developing. I need to find a move that addresses the immediate threats and improves my position. Let's see what my legal moves are.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, I have a lot of options. Let's analyze them:

*   **King moves (e6f7, e6d7, e6d5):** These moves don't seem to improve the king's safety and could potentially weaken the pawn shield.
*   **Queen moves (d8e8, d8c8, d8b8, d8d7, d8c7, d8b6, d8a5):** The queen is currently well-placed. Moving it now might not be the best use of the queen.
*   **Rook moves (a8c8, a8b8, g8h8, g8g7):** These moves don't seem to be immediately helpful.
*   **Bishop moves (f8g7):** This develops the bishop, but it's not a high-priority move.
*   **Pawn moves:** There are many pawn moves. Some of them look interesting.

Considering the position, I think I need to consolidate my position and prepare for a possible attack. The pawn moves seem the most promising. Specifically, I like the idea of pushing the pawn in front of the king to create a pawn shield.

I'll move the pawn on g6 to g5. This supports the king and prepares for a possible kingside defense.

The most pressing issue is the threat to my King. I need to find a move that improves my defense. After reviewing the board again, I realize that I missed a crucial detail. My Queen is under attack. I need to move my Queen.
