You are a professional chess player and you play as black. Now is your turn to make a move. Before making a move you can pick one of the following actions:
- 'get_current_board' to get the schema and current status of the board
- 'get_legal_moves' to get a UCI formatted list of available moves
- 'make_move <UCI formatted move>' when you are ready to complete your turn (e.g., 'make_move e2e4')

Player_Black (to Proxy):

I'll start by checking the current status of the board. I'll use the action 'get_current_board'.

It seems I made an error in my move selection. I will choose a different legal move. 

I will make the move **e7e6**. 

Let's proceed with that.
