--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

I see all my legal moves now. As Black responding to the Bird's Opening (1.f4), one of the strongest responses is 1...e5, known as the From Gambit. This move immediately challenges White's control of the center and puts pressure on the f4 pawn.

The From Gambit is considered one of the best responses to the Bird's Opening as it leads to sharp play and good counterattacking chances for Black. If White captures with 2.fxe5, Black can continue with 2...d6 to recapture the pawn with good development prospects.

I'll play this principled response:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

After analyzing the position and my available moves, I'll make a decision.

The position shows an early opening where White has played somewhat unconventionally with a3, c4, and f4. I've captured on f4 with my e-pawn, and now I should continue with solid development.

I should focus on developing my pieces, controlling the center, and potentially exploiting White's somewhat loose pawn structure. One of the strongest moves here would be to develop my dark-squared bishop to e7, which develops a piece while maintaining flexibility.

I can see the position now. I'm playing as Black and have several interesting options. 

I notice that I have the opportunity to castle kingside with "e8g8" which is a strong move that would secure my king's safety. Castling is often a priority in the middlegame as it connects my rooks and moves my king to a safer position.

The position appears to be in the early middlegame with some piece development already completed. My king is still in the center, which makes castling particularly valuable.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

I'll analyze the position:

I'm playing as Black and I notice several key aspects of the position:
- White has advanced a pawn to f4, creating tension with my e5 pawn
- My king is on g8 with castling still available (I can play Rf8-g8 or Rf8-e8)
- I have knights on c6 and f6, bishops on e7 and c8
- The position appears to be in an early middlegame phase

Looking at my options, I should focus on development and king safety. I notice I can complete kingside castling with Rf8-g8, which would be a natural move to secure my king.

Another strong option is to challenge White's center with e5-e4, putting pressure on White's knight on f3.

After consideration, I believe castling is the priority for king safety.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

After analyzing the position and my available legal moves, I'll make a decision.

I notice I'm playing a variation of the Sicilian Defense with a somewhat unusual pawn structure. White has advanced a pawn to f4, and I have knights on c6 and f6, with bishops on e7 and c8.

One of the strongest moves here would be to develop my bishop from c8 and castle, which would improve my king safety and piece coordination.

Looking at the board, I notice:
- I have the option to castle kingside (e8g8)
- My knights are well developed
- There's some tension in the center with my e5 pawn
- White has a queen on c2

Castling is often a priority to get the king to safety, and in this position it looks like a good option since my kingside is relatively secure.

- I have knights on c6 and f6
- I have bishops on e7 and c8
- My pawn structure is mostly intact with an advanced e5 pawn
- White has a pawn on f4 that's capturing my e5 pawn's attention

One of the strongest moves I see is developing my bishop to e7-c5, which would increase my control of the center and put pressure on White's position.

Looking at the board, I notice:
- I have two bishops (c5 and c6 knight) that are well-developed
- White has pushed the f-pawn to f4, creating some space on the kingside
- My king is on g8 without castling yet
- I have a pawn on e5 that could be supported or advanced

Among my options:
- I could castle with g8f8 or g8e8
- I could develop my rook with a8b8
- I have several knight moves from f6 and c6
- I could move my dark-squared bishop on c5

Castling is a priority for king safety, and since the kingside looks somewhat exposed with the f4 pawn advance by White, I'll castle queenside.

3. I have knights on c6 and f6 in good positions
4. White has advanced a pawn to f4, creating some tension in the center

Castling kingside would be a priority as it brings my king to safety and connects my rooks. This is typically one of the most important early/middle game objectives.

I'll analyze the position as Black:

The position appears to be in the middle game with an interesting pawn structure. White has a queen on c3 and has advanced a pawn to f4, while I have bishops on c5 and c6, knights on f6 and c6, and my king is on g8.

Looking at my options:
- I notice my bishop on c5 is attacking White's queen on c3
- My e5 pawn is under attack by White's f4 pawn
- I should consider development and king safety

Among my best options:
1. Developing my rook with `a8b8` or moving my king to safety with `g8f8`
2. Capturing with my bishop if possible
3. Defending my e5 pawn or advancing it

After consideration, I'll move my bishop on c5 to e3, which attacks White's queen and creates a strong threat.

Looking at the position more carefully, I see that my bishop on e3 is attacking the white knight on f4, and I could capture it. This would be a good move as it removes a knight that's in an active position and could potentially threaten my pieces.

I need to analyze this position carefully. 

I notice several key features:
- My king is on g8 with no immediate threats
- I have a bishop on f4 that's actively placed
- White has a queen on c2 that could become dangerous
- There's a pawn confrontation on e5/f4

Looking at my options, I see a strong move with my bishop on f4. It can attack White's queen on c2 by moving to d2, creating a powerful tactical threat.

Looking at the board, I notice:
- My king is on g8 with no immediate threats
- White has a queen on c2 and a knight on c3
- I have two knights (c6 and f6) that could be developed
- My e5 pawn is advanced and could be supported or pushed

Among my options:
- Knight moves like f6e4 could be aggressive but need to check if it's safe
- Developing my king's position with g8f8 or g8e8 could be useful
- Pushing central pawns like d7d5 could contest the center

After evaluation, I'll make a move that improves my position.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

After analyzing the position, I can see several key factors:

1. The kings are on opposite sides (my king is on g8, white's on d3)
2. I have two knights developed (c6 and f6) and my dark-squared bishop on c8
3. White has a pawn on f4 that's attacking my e5 pawn
4. I need to consider both development and king safety

Looking at my options, I should prioritize either:
- Completing development
- Improving king safety
- Counterattacking in the center

The move Bf5 (c8f5) looks strong as it:
- Develops my bishop to an active square
- Puts pressure on White's position
- Prepares for potential kingside castling later

The position shows I'm playing Black in what appears to be a middle game position. I have my king on g8, queen on d8, and several pieces developed. I notice my bishop on f5 is active and my knights are on c6 and f6.

Looking at the legal moves, I see several strong options:
- I could develop my bishop further with f5e4
- I could protect my e5 pawn with d8e7
- I could improve my knight position with f6e4 or c6d4

I think the most active move is to advance my knight to e4, which puts pressure on the center and creates threats.

After analyzing the position, I see several strong options:

1. The knight on e4 is attacking the white king on e5, creating a check.
2. I have a bishop on f5 that could potentially be part of an attack.
3. My queen on d8 has several possible moves.

The most critical move here is to capitalize on the check. Looking at the knight on e4, I can see it's checking the white king. Among the legal moves, I have options like e4f6, e4g5, e4c5, e4g3, e4c3, e4f2, or e4d2.

The best move appears to be e4c3, forking the white king and potentially another piece while maintaining the check. This forces the king to move and I'll gain material.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

After analyzing the position and available moves, I can see I'm playing as Black in what appears to be a complex middlegame position. 

I notice several key elements:
- My king is on g8 with a rook on h8
- I have a queen on d8 and another rook on c8
- I have two knights (c6 and e4) and a bishop on f5
- White has a queen on b2 and king on e5

The most striking feature is White's king on e5, which is quite exposed in the center. This presents a tactical opportunity.

My knight on e4 is attacking the white king, and if I can coordinate an attack with other pieces, I might gain material or even create a mating attack.

The move Qd8-f6 looks very strong, as it:
1. Attacks the white king directly
2. Creates a double attack with my knight
3. Threatens mate if the king doesn't move

I'll make this move:

make_move d8f6

After analyzing the position and available moves, I notice several strong options:

1. I have a bishop on f5 that could attack the white king on e5 with `f5e6`, putting the king in check.
2. My knight on e4 could also give check with `e4d6` or `e4g3`.
3. I have a queen on f6 that could deliver check with `f6e6`.

The most decisive move appears to be `f6e6`, which would be a direct check from my queen, and the white king has limited escape squares due to my pieces controlling many squares around it.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

I can see that I have two legal moves as Black:
- h8g7: Moving my king from h8 to g7
- g8g7: Moving my rook from g8 to g7

Let me analyze the position:

I notice that White's queen is on g7, directly attacking my king on h8. This is check, and I must respond to it. I have only two options - either move my king to g7 or block with my rook by moving it to g7.

If I move my king to g7 (h8g7), I would be capturing White's queen, which is an excellent outcome. This would remove White's most powerful piece and get my king out of check.

If I move my rook to g7 (g8g7), I would be sacrificing my rook to block the check, which is clearly inferior to capturing the queen with my king.

Therefore, I'll capture the queen with my king:

I can see the current position and my legal moves. Let me analyze the situation:

As Black, I have:
- My king on g7 with several possible moves
- My queen on e6
- Two knights (c6 and f7)
- A bishop on e4
- Rooks on a8 and g8
- Several pawns

Looking at the position, I notice:
- White's king is exposed on e3
- I have a bishop on e4 that's attacking the white king
- My queen on e6 could potentially join an attack

One of the strongest moves appears to be moving my queen to f6, which would:
1. Maintain pressure on White's position
2. Create a powerful battery with my queen and rook
3. Protect my king's potential escape square
4. Maintain control of important central squares

Player_Black (to Proxy):

After analyzing the position and available moves, I notice several key factors:

1. I have a queen on c3 and two knights (c6 and f2)
2. I have a bishop on e4 that's attacking White's king on e5
3. White has a bishop on d4 that's threatening my queen

Looking at the position, I see a strong tactical opportunity. My bishop on e4 is already putting pressure on White's king at e5, and I can use my knight to create a devastating attack.

I'll play:

make_move f2d3

This knight move creates a double attack - it checks the king while also threatening White's bishop on d4. This forces White to move their king, after which I can capture the bishop with my queen, gaining material while maintaining pressure.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

After analyzing the position, I see I have several strong options as Black. I have a material advantage and my pieces are actively placed with my queen on c3 and bishop on e4 targeting the white king on e5.

One of the most powerful moves I see is to use my queen to attack the white king directly:

make_move c3f6

This move delivers a check to the white king while also attacking the g7 pawn. This creates a double attack (check and threat to the pawn), forcing White to deal with the check first. The king has limited escape squares, and after White responds to the check, I'll have further tactical opportunities to increase my advantage.

2. White's king is exposed on e5

4. I have knights on c6 and d3, and a queen on f6

The most promising move appears to be using my bishop to check the white king:

make_move e4f3

This move:
- Puts White's king in check
- Maintains control of important central squares
- Threatens to win material if White has to move the king and expose other pieces

After analyzing the position, I see I have several strong pieces in active positions. My queen on f6 is well-placed, I have two knights (c6 and e5) in good central positions, and a bishop on e2. 

I notice my bishop on e2 is particularly strong, pinning the white king to the rook on h5. This is a tactical opportunity I should exploit. The move e2f3 would check the king and threaten the rook on h5, creating a double attack.

After analyzing the position, I see several strong options. I notice my queen on f6 has many possible moves, and I have two knights that could be developed further.

Looking at the position more carefully, I see that White's king is on e5 and my bishop on f3 is already putting pressure on it. I can exploit this tactical opportunity.

I'll play the bishop move f3g2, which checks the White king while also threatening the pawn on h1. This forces the king to move and gives me a strong attacking position.

1. I have two knights (on c6 and e5) that could potentially create threats
2. My queen on f6 is active and could be used for attack
3. My bishop on g2 is well-placed, targeting White's position

One particularly strong move I see is to move my bishop from g2 to e4, which attacks White's king on e5 and creates a check. This forces White to respond to the check and gives me the initiative.

One particularly strong move I see is to move my knight from e4 to g2, which would be a fork attacking both White's king on e5 and the rook on e5. This creates a double attack that White cannot defend against both pieces simultaneously.

After analyzing the position, I can see I'm playing as Black with a material advantage. I have two knights, a bishop, two rooks, and my king against White's bishop, two rooks, and king.

I notice my bishop on e5 is attacking White's king on e5, creating a check. This is a critical tactical moment. I should capitalize on this check by either capturing material or improving my position.

Looking at my legal moves, I see that my bishop on e5 can move to several squares while maintaining the check. The most aggressive option would be to capture the pawn on g3 with check, which also threatens White's rook on e1.

I apologize for the error. Let me check the legal moves again and make a valid move.

Looking at the board and the legal moves list, I see that my bishop is on e4 (not e5 as I incorrectly stated), and there is no pawn on g3. Let me select a strong move from the legal moves list.

The bishop on e4 is giving check to the White king on e3. I can capture the pawn on g2 with check, which would be a strong move:

Now I can see all my legal moves. Let me analyze the position:

I notice I have a bishop on g2 that's attacking White's rook on e5. This is a valuable piece I can capture. I also have knights on c6 and e5, and my king is on g7.

The move g2e4 would capture White's rook on e5 with my bishop, which is an excellent move as I would win a rook for a bishop (a material gain of about 2 points).

I'll make this capture:

After analyzing the position, I see several interesting options:

1. I have a bishop on e4 that's attacking the white king on f4
2. I have a knight on e4 that could deliver a check or make a tactical move
3. My rooks on c8 and g8 could be developed

The most critical aspect is that my bishop on e4 is directly attacking the white king on f4. This is an extremely powerful position that I should capitalize on immediately.

Looking at the legal moves, I can play e4f3+ which would check the king. This seems like the strongest move as it forces the king to move and maintains pressure.

Looking at the position, I see I'm playing as Black and have several interesting options. Let me analyze the key aspects:

1. Material seems roughly equal
2. My king is on g7 with reasonable safety
3. I have a bishop on f3 that's actively placed
4. I have knights on c6 and e5 in good positions
5. White has a rook on e5 that could be targeted

One of my strongest moves appears to be attacking White's rook with my knight: c6e7, which would fork White's king on f6 and rook on e5.

This is a powerful tactical opportunity that would win material, as White cannot save both pieces.

Looking at the legal moves, I think the strongest continuation is to increase the pressure with my knight on e7 by moving it to c6, which attacks the white pawn on b4 while developing my piece to a more active square.

Let me analyze the position and make a strong move as Black.

I notice several key features of the position:
- I have two knights (c6 and e5) that are well-positioned
- I have a bishop on g2 that's attacking diagonally
- White's king is on f4, somewhat exposed
- I have a pawn on d5 that could potentially advance

Looking at my options, I see a particularly strong move: the knight on e5 can capture White's pawn on g4, which would attack White's king and pawn structure simultaneously.

I apologize for the error. Let me check the legal moves again and make a valid move.

Looking at the list of legal moves provided, I see that "e5g4" isn't actually listed. Let me re-examine the board and the legal moves.

From the legal moves list, I see that my knight on e5 can actually capture on d4 with "e5d4". This is a strong move as it captures a pawn and improves my knight's position.

I apologize for the confusion. Let me carefully review the legal moves list again.

Looking at the provided list of legal moves, I notice that "e5d4" isn't actually listed. Let me double-check the board position and the legal moves.

From the legal moves list, I see that my knight on position e5 isn't mentioned in the starting positions of the legal moves. The knights appear to be at c6 and d5 according to the legal moves list.

Let me make a strong move from the available options. The bishop on g2 can capture on e4, which would be a powerful move:

g7f8,g7g6,c6e5,f7f6

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

I need to analyze the position carefully before making my move:

Current assessment:
- Material: I'm up a bishop (Black has a bishop and knight vs White's bishop)
- King safety: My king is on g7, White's king is on f4
- Threats: White's bishop on e5 is attacking my pawn on d4
- My bishop on e4 is controlling important diagonals
- My knight on c6 can move to e5, which would attack White's king

Looking at my legal moves:
1. g7f8 - Moving my king to the back rank
2. g7g6 - Moving my king to g6
3. c6e5 - Moving my knight to e5, attacking White's king
4. f7f6 - Advancing my f-pawn

The move c6e5 stands out as it creates a direct knight check on White's king. This is a strong tactical move that forces White to respond to the check and gives me the initiative.

After analyzing the position, I see several key factors:

1. I have a bishop on g4 and a knight on e5, both actively placed
2. White has a rook on d4 that's quite active
3. My king on g7 could use some safety

One of the strongest moves I see is to use my bishop to attack White's king on f4:

make_move g4f3

This move directly attacks the White king, forcing an immediate response. If White captures my bishop, I can recapture with my knight, maintaining pressure. This is a strong tactical opportunity that should give me a significant advantage.

2. White has a rook on d4 threatening my knight on e5
3. I have a bishop on f3 that's attacking White's king on f4
4. Material seems roughly equal with both sides having active pieces

The most critical issue is my knight on e5 being under attack. I need to either move it or defend it. Looking at my options, I can see several strong knight moves like Nd3+ which would give check, or Nc4 which would attack White's rook.

However, I notice an even stronger move - my bishop on f3 is already attacking White's king on f4. This is a direct check, and looking at the position, it appears to be a very strong check that could lead to material gain or even checkmate.

I notice my knight on e5 is very active and has multiple good options. It's threatening White's position and could be used for a tactical strike. I also have two rooks on c8 and g8 that could be better coordinated.

Looking at the knight moves, e5f3 looks particularly strong as it would attack White's king and potentially create a fork. This would put immediate pressure on White.

I'll make this move:

This is a critical position where I can deliver a decisive blow with my knight. I'll play:

make_move f3g5

This knight move to g5 is a fork, simultaneously attacking the white king on f4 and the rook on e5. Since the king is in check, White must move the king, allowing me to capture the rook on the next move. This is a winning tactical shot.

After analyzing the position, I can see I'm playing as Black with my king on g7. I have both rooks on the back rank (c8 and g8), and a knight on g5. The White king is on f4, and there are various pawns for both sides.

Looking at my legal moves, I notice my knight on g5 has several options. One strong move would be to attack the White king with Ng5-e6+, giving a check.

2. I have a knight on e6 and rooks on c8 and g8
3. White has rooks on d3 and d8, with the white king on f3

Looking at my options, I notice my knight on e6 has several good moves. In particular, the knight can fork White's king and rook with Nf4+, which would give a check and threaten the rook on d3.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

I need to analyze this position carefully as Black.

Looking at the board:
- White has two rooks on the d-file (d1 and d7)
- My king is on g7 with my rooks on c8 and g8
- White's king is on e5
- I have a knight on g2 which appears to be a strong piece

The most pressing issue is that White's rook on d7 is threatening my position. I should consider either defending against potential threats or creating counterplay.

Among my options:
- Moving my knight on g2 could create threats
- Rook moves could help consolidate my position
- King safety is important

I think the best move is to activate my knight with a fork:

- My king on g7
- My rooks on c8 and g8
- My knight on e3
- My pawns on a7, b7, c7, f7, and h7

Looking at the position, I notice:
- White has two rooks on the d-file (d1 and d4)
- White's king is on f4
- My knight on e3 is very active and could be a strong piece

My knight on e3 is particularly well-placed, attacking White's king on f4. I should consider using this tactical opportunity. The move e3g2+ would be a knight fork, attacking both White's king and potentially another piece.

I'll make this move:

Looking at the legal moves, I should prioritize safety and counterplay. The knight on g2 seems to be in a strong position, potentially threatening White's king on g4. I could also consider improving my rook position.

After evaluating the options, I'll move my knight from g2 to e3, which puts pressure on White's position and attacks a central square.

After analyzing the position, I see I'm playing as Black with my king on g7. White has two rooks on the d-file and a king on f4. I have a knight on e3 which is actively placed in White's territory, and two rooks on c8 and g8.

My knight on e3 is particularly strong, forking White's position. Looking at the legal moves, I can see several promising options:

1. I could attack White's king with Ne3-g4+
2. I could capture a pawn with Ne3-g2
3. I could move my rook to create threats

The knight move to g4 giving check seems strongest as it forces White's king to move and maintains my knight in an active position.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

I need to analyze the position carefully before making my move.

Looking at the board:
- I'm playing as Black with my king on g7
- White has a rook on d7 that's attacking my c7 pawn
- White has another rook on f1
- White's king is on f4
- I have a knight on g4 that could be useful
- My rooks are on c8 and g8

The most pressing issue is the rook on d7 attacking my c7 pawn. I also notice my knight on g4 is well-positioned and could potentially create threats.

One strong move would be to use my knight to attack White's king with Ng4-e5+, putting the king in check and potentially forking other pieces.

I need to analyze this position carefully. I'm playing as Black, and I notice:

1. Material is roughly even
2. My king is on g7 with some pawn protection
3. I have a knight on e5 in a strong central position
4. White has rooks on f1 and f2, potentially threatening my f7 pawn
5. White's king is on f4

Looking at my options, I should prioritize safety and development. The knight on e5 is well-placed and could potentially create threats. I also need to ensure my king's safety.

One strong move would be to connect my rooks by moving the c8 rook to f8, which would protect my f7 pawn and create a stronger defensive structure.

- White has a king on f4 and rooks on f1 and h1
- I have rooks on f8 and g8, and a knight on e5
- The pawn structure is interesting with several pawns for both sides

My knight on e5 is well-positioned and attacking several squares. My king on g7 seems relatively safe. I should consider improving my position while maintaining defensive resources.

Among my options, I think developing my rook with f8e8 would be a good move. This centralizes one of my rooks and maintains flexibility.

I notice my knight on g5 is attacking White's king on f4, delivering check. This is a critical tactical opportunity. I should either capture the king or make a strong move that maintains pressure.

Looking at the legal moves, I see that my knight can move to e4, e6, h3, or f3. The best move is to capture the undefended pawn on e4 with my knight while maintaining the check on the king.

The best move appears to be to attack White's king with my knight while also threatening the rook on b2:

Player_Black (to Proxy):

After analyzing the position, I see I'm playing as Black with my king on g7 and a knight on f2. White has a strong position with rooks on b4 and d1, and the white king is on f4.

I notice my knight on f2 is attacking the white king on f4. This creates a check opportunity. I'll play:

make_move f2h3

This knight move to h3 creates a fork between the white king on f4 and the rook on d1. White will have to move their king, and then I can capture the rook on my next move. This is a strong tactical opportunity that should win material.

Looking at the position, I notice my king is somewhat exposed on g7, and I should consider improving my position. One strong move would be to centralize my rook on e8 by moving it to e4, where it attacks White's pawn on a4 and gains activity.

- White's king is on e5, somewhat exposed
- My king is on g7, relatively safe

One of the strongest moves I see is to attack White's king with my rook:

4. White has a king on g4 and rooks on b2 and c1

Looking at the position, I notice my knight on g5 is attacking White's king on g4. This is a check! I should capitalize on this tactical opportunity.

The best move is to capture the white pawn on e4 with my knight while maintaining the check:

Player_Black (to Proxy):

After analyzing the position, I can see I'm playing as Black with my king on g7. White has a rook on b2 and c1, with the white king on g3. I have a knight on e4 which is attacking several squares.

One of the strongest moves I can make is to use my knight to attack the white king and rook simultaneously with a fork:

make_move e4f2

This knight fork attacks both the white king on g3 and the rook on b2. White will be forced to move their king, after which I can capture the rook on b2, winning material. This is a classic tactical opportunity that should give me a significant advantage.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

After analyzing the position and my legal moves, I can see I'm playing as Black with my king on g7 and rooks on e8 and g8. I also have a knight on f2 that's actively positioned in White's territory.

Looking at the board, I notice my knight on f2 is attacking White's king on f3, creating a check. This is a strong tactical position. I should consider my best move carefully.

Since my knight is giving check, I need to decide the best follow-up. The knight on f2 has several options, including Nd3, Ne4, Ng4, and Nh3. Among these, Nh3 looks particularly strong as it maintains pressure while moving to a safer square.

I'll make this move:

make_move f2h3

Let me analyze the position:

I'm playing as Black and it appears we're in an endgame with rooks and a knight. I have a knight on f2 that's quite active, and two rooks on e8 and g8. My king is on g7.

Looking at the legal moves, I notice my knight on f2 has several good options. It's currently attacking White's king area and could potentially create threats.

I also need to consider the safety of my king and the activity of my rooks.

After evaluating the position, I'll make a move with my knight to increase pressure on White's position:

After analyzing the position, I see I'm playing as Black with my king on g8 and rooks on e8 and g8. I have a knight on d3 that has several potential moves.

Looking at the position, I notice my knight on d3 is active and can make several strong moves. The f2 square looks particularly attractive as it would put pressure on White's king on f3.

I'll make the knight move to f2, which creates a tactical threat against the white king:

Let me analyze the position:

I'm playing as Black with my king on g8 and rooks on e8 and g8. I also have a knight on f2 which is actively placed in White's territory. White has a king on f3 and a rook on b1.

Looking at my options, I notice my knight on f2 is very active and could potentially deliver a check. Let me consider the knight moves:
- f2g4+ would check the White king
- f2e4 threatens the king's vicinity
- f2h3 is a retreat
- f2d3 controls important squares
- f2h1 and f2d1 move to the back rank

The move f2g4+ stands out as it gives check and forces the White king to move, giving me the initiative.

Looking at the position, I notice I'm playing as Black with my king on g8, rooks on e8 and g8, and a knight on e3. White has a king on f3 and a rook on b2, with various pawns for both sides.

My knight on e3 is attacking White's king on f3, which is a check. I should capitalize on this tactical opportunity. The best move appears to be to capture White's rook with my knight while maintaining the check on the king.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

I'll analyze this position as Black.

Looking at the board, I see we're in an endgame with rooks and pawns. My king is on g8, with rooks on e8 and g8. White's king is on f3, with a rook on g7.

The position appears to be quite simplified. I notice that my king is somewhat exposed, and I should consider improving its position. Since I have two rooks, I should try to coordinate them effectively.

Among my options, connecting my rooks by moving my king to f8 seems logical, as it maintains king safety while improving piece coordination.

One of the strongest moves here is to use my rook to control the open e-file and potentially threaten White's position:

1. I can use my rook on e1, which is already on an open file and attacking White's position

3. My king on g8 can move to g7

The most powerful move appears to be using my rook on e1, which is already in a very strong position on White's back rank. This rook is threatening White's position and controlling the e-file.

3. I have several pawn moves available

Looking at the position, I notice I can use my e-rook to attack along the e-file. Since White's king is on f4, moving my rook to e4 would create a check.

This is a strong move as it:
- Puts immediate pressure on White's king
- Controls the 4th rank
- Could potentially win material if White doesn't respond correctly

I'll make this move:

I notice I have a powerful rook on e4 that's controlling the e-file. One of my strongest moves would be to attack White's king with a check by moving my rook from e4 to e5.

I notice an immediate checkmate opportunity with my rook on f6. I can move it to g6, which would deliver checkmate since White's king on g5 would be attacked with no legal moves.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

I need to analyze this position carefully. I'm playing as Black and I see:

1. I have a rook on f8 and h2, a king on g8, and pawns on c7, f7, and h7
2. White has a king on g3, a bishop on a7, and pawns on b2 and c4

This appears to be an endgame position where I have a significant material advantage with two rooks. Looking at the position, I notice:

- My king is on g8 with a rook on f8 protecting it
- My second rook is on h2, which is deep in White's territory and potentially threatening White's king
- White's king is on g3, somewhat exposed

The most forcing move appears to be to use my rook on h2 to check White's king or threaten mate. The move h2g2 would put White's king in check and force it to move.

I need to analyze this position carefully. 

I'm playing as Black and I see:
- My king is on g8 with a rook on f8
- I have another rook on g2 that's attacking the white king on f3
- White has a bishop on a7 and pawns on b2, c3

The most striking feature is my rook on g2 is attacking the white king on f3. This is a very powerful position. I should consider:

1. Checking with Rg2-f2+ would force the king to move
2. Moving my king to safety (h8-g7)
3. Bringing my other rook into the attack

Since the white king is under attack from my rook, I should capitalize on this tactical opportunity. The most forcing move is to check the king.

- White has a king on g3 and a bishop on a7
- Material is roughly equal, but I have a strong rook on f2 that's active in White's territory
- My king appears to be safe at the moment

The most powerful move I see is to use my active rook on f2 to attack the white king. The move `f2g2` would put White's king in check and apply significant pressure.

I see all my legal moves now. Since White has played 1.g4, one of the strongest responses is to immediately challenge this pawn with 1...h5. This puts pressure on White's advanced g-pawn and can lead to early complications favorable for Black.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Looking at the position, I see White has played the Grob Opening (1.g4), which is quite aggressive but also creates weaknesses around White's king.

The most principled response is to immediately attack the advanced g4 pawn with 1...h5, which would threaten to win a pawn. However, I notice from the board that I've already played 1...h5, and White has responded with 2.g5.

Now I have several good options:
1. I could capture the pawn with 1...hxg4
2. I could play a central pawn move like 1...d5 or 1...e5
3. I could develop a piece with 1...Nf6

Among these, capturing the pawn with h5xg4 is the most direct and gives me an immediate material advantage while also opening the h-file for my rook.

1. I'm playing as Black and it appears we're in the early opening phase
2. White has developed some pieces including knights to c3 and h3, and the bishop to g2
3. I have knights on c6 and f6, and a pawn on g4 that seems to have advanced

Looking at my options, I should focus on development and control of the center. The pawn on g4 is somewhat exposed, but not immediately threatened.

Good candidate moves include:
- e7e5: Stake a claim in the center
- d7d5: Control the center
- e7e6: Solid development preparing for d5
- f8e7 or c8e6: Develop bishops

Since e7e5 is a standard response that helps control the center and opens lines for my bishop and queen, I'll choose that move.

After analyzing the position and the available legal moves, I'll make my decision.

I notice that White has developed a knight to c3 and a bishop to g2, while I have knights on c6 and f6, with pawns advanced to e5 and g4. I should continue my development.

One of the best moves here would be to develop my dark-squared bishop with Bf8-e7, which develops a piece, protects my king, and prepares for castling.

I see the position now. I'm playing as Black and have several interesting options. 

Looking at the position, I notice:
- I have the option to castle kingside (e8g8)
- My knight on f6 has several good options
- My bishop on e7 is developed
- White has a knight on c3 and a bishop on g2

Given the position, I think castling kingside is a priority to ensure king safety and connect my rooks. This is a standard and strong move in many openings.

I need to analyze the position carefully before making my move.

Looking at the board, I notice:
- I'm playing Black and have a standard development with knights on c6 and f6
- White has a bishop on g2 and a knight on c3
- There's a pawn on b4 that could be threatening my knight on c6
- My e-pawn has advanced to e5
- I have a g-pawn pushed to g4

Among my options, I should consider:
1. Developing my king to safety with castling (g8h8)
2. Continuing development with moves like f8e8
3. Knight moves that improve my position or create threats

Castling kingside seems like a priority to get my king to safety. This is a standard and strong move in many openings.

After analyzing the position, I can see I'm playing as Black with a fairly developed position. I notice:

1. My king is on h8 without castling rights
2. I have knights on c6 and f6, bishops on e7 and c8
3. White has a bishop on e5 that's attacking my f6 knight
4. I have a pawn on e5 that could be vulnerable

Looking at my options, I should prioritize king safety and piece coordination. The knight on f6 is under attack from White's bishop on e5, so I should consider moving it or defending it.

One strong move would be to develop my light-squared bishop with e7-c5, which puts pressure on White's position and improves my piece activity.

4. White has a bishop on f4 that's targeting my position

I'll play a solid developing move that improves my position. The knight on f6 can move to e4, where it would be centralized and put pressure on White's position.

I notice my king is on h8 and I have a rook on f8, which means I can castle kingside with "h8g8". This would improve my king's safety and connect my rooks.

I also see I have two knights (on c6 and e4) and two bishops (on c5 and c8), along with my queen on d8. My pawn structure is mostly intact.

Given the position, castling would be a strong move to improve my king's safety:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

After analyzing the position and available moves, I see several key factors:

1. My king is exposed on g8 with no pawn shield
2. I have two bishops (c5 and c5) and two knights (c6 and e4) actively placed
3. White has a knight on a4 threatening my c5 bishop

One of my strongest pieces is the knight on e4, which is centralized and putting pressure on multiple squares. I should consider either:
- Developing my rook on f8 to e8
- Improving my king safety by castling (moving g8h8)
- Moving my bishop on c5 to safety if threatened

The move g8h8 (castling kingside) looks particularly good as it improves my king safety while connecting my rooks.

I can see the current position and my legal moves. Let me analyze the situation:

1. I notice my king is on h8 and I have a rook on f8, so castling is not an option.
2. White has a knight on a4 threatening my bishop on c5.
3. I have knights on c6 and e4, and bishops on c5 and c8.
4. My g-pawn has been advanced to g4.

One strong move would be to develop my bishop from c5 to e3, which attacks White's queen on d4 and creates a powerful threat. This forces White to respond to the threat and gives me the initiative.

One of the strongest moves appears to be capturing the knight on f2 with my knight, which would fork the white king and rook:

This knight move to e4 is strong because:
1. It attacks White's pawn on d6
2. It establishes my knight on a central square
3. It creates threats against White's position
4. It improves my piece activity

Looking at the position more carefully, I see that my knight on e4 can capture the white knight on f6, which would be a good material gain.

3. White has a knight on f5 that's somewhat threatening
4. My pawn structure is mostly intact

Looking at my options, the bishop on e3 has several good moves. In particular, I notice that Bxf2+ would be a check that captures a pawn. This is a strong tactical opportunity that would attack White's king and win material.

After analyzing the position and legal moves, I see several good options. I notice my bishop on e3 is active and can potentially create threats. I also have a knight on c6 that could be developed to a better square.

Looking at the position, I see that White has a knight on e5 which is quite centralized. My bishop on e3 is well-placed and could potentially capture White's bishop on g1. 

One strong move would be to develop my knight from c6 to e5, capturing White's knight there. This would give me control of a strong central square.

As Black, I notice:

- I have a knight on e5 that appears to be in a good position
- I have bishops on c8 and e5
- My queen is on d8
- I'm missing a pawn on f7 and h7
- White has a knight on c4 and a bishop on g7

Thank you for the list of legal moves. Let me analyze the position and make a decision.

Looking at the position, I notice several interesting possibilities:

1. My bishop on e3 is very active and has multiple good squares to move to
2. My knight on e5 is well-positioned and can make some threats
3. I have some pawn moves that could improve my position

After analyzing the options, I believe one of the strongest moves is to move my bishop to f2, which attacks White's king and rook simultaneously, creating a powerful tactical threat.

Thank you for providing the legal moves. Let me analyze the position and make a decision.

Looking at the available moves, I notice several interesting options:

1. My knight on e5 is well-positioned and has multiple options (g6, c6, c4, f3, d3)
2. My bishop on f2 is actively placed and has many possible moves
3. I have castling available (h8g8)

After evaluating the position, I believe castling kingside is a priority to improve my king's safety. This is a fundamental principle in chess - king safety should be addressed early, especially when the center is somewhat open.

- My knight on e5 is well-positioned in the center
- White has a knight on d4 that's somewhat advanced

Looking at my options, I see some strong possibilities:

1. The bishop on f2 has several good moves, particularly Bc5+ which would check the White king
2. My knight on e5 could move to c4 or f3, both creating threats
3. I could develop my queenside with moves like a6 or b6

After evaluation, I believe the strongest move is to play the bishop check.

- My knight on e5 is well-placed and could potentially fork pieces
- I have two bishops that can be developed further
- My king safety could be improved

Among the legal moves, I see some strong candidates:
- e5c4: Moving my knight to attack White's b-pawn
- c5d4: Capturing White's knight with my bishop
- g8h8: Improving king safety by moving away from the center
- e5f3: Knight fork threatening White's king and rook

After evaluation, I'll capture the knight on d4 with my bishop, which removes a centralized piece and improves my position.

I need to analyze the position carefully before making my move.

Looking at the board, I notice:
- I'm playing as Black and have a knight on e5 and a bishop on d4
- White has a bishop on c3 and a knight on d5
- My king is on g8 with no immediate threats
- I have a pawn on g4 that's advanced

The bishop on d4 is particularly strong, controlling key diagonals. I can see it's targeting f2, which could be a weakness in White's position.

One of the strongest moves appears to be:

make_move d4f2

This move attacks White's king and rook simultaneously with my bishop, creating a powerful fork. This should win material as White will have to move the king and allow me to capture the rook on the next move.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

After analyzing the position and the available legal moves, I can see several interesting options. 

I notice I have a bishop on f2 that's actively placed and attacking the white kingside. I also have a knight on e5 in a strong central position. The position appears somewhat complex with potential tactical opportunities.

Looking at my most promising moves:
- The bishop on f2 has several good options, particularly f2g3 which attacks the white rook
- The knight on e5 can make several jumps, with e5g6 potentially threatening the h-pawn
- I could also consider castling with g8h8 to improve my king safety

After evaluation, I believe the most pressing move is to activate my bishop with a check:

I notice that:
1. White has a bishop on c3 attacking my queenside
2. My knight on e5 is well-positioned and could potentially fork pieces
3. I need to continue development and improve my king's safety

After evaluating the options, I'll develop my kingside by castling, which will improve my king's safety and connect my rooks:

One of the strongest moves here would be to develop my rook to e8, connecting my rooks and controlling the open e-file:

1. I notice I have the opportunity to castle kingside with e8g8 (O-O), which would improve my king's safety.
2. My knight on e5 is well-placed in the center.
3. White has a bishop on a4 that could be threatening something.
4. I have a pawn on g7 that could be advanced.

After evaluating the position, castling kingside seems to be the best move to improve my king's safety and connect my rooks. This is a standard developing move that should strengthen my position.

I'll analyze the position as Black:

The position appears to be in the middle game with some pieces already exchanged. I notice:
- White has a bishop on a4 and a knight on g5
- I have a knight on e5 in a strong central position
- My king is castled kingside but the pawn shield is incomplete (h-pawn is missing)
- White's king is on f1 with rooks on d1 and g1

Looking at my options, I see several promising moves:

1. Developing my bishop with `d8e7` would connect my rooks
2. Knight moves like `e5c4` could attack White's d-pawn
3. Advancing pawns like `d7d5` could claim more central space

After consideration, I'll develop my queen's bishop which improves my position by connecting rooks and preparing to castle queenside if needed.

I notice my queen on d6 has many options. One strong move would be to attack White's king position with my queen while developing my pieces. The knight on e5 is well-placed and controls important central squares.

I'll move my queen to f6, which:
1. Maintains control of important central squares
2. Puts pressure on White's kingside
3. Protects my g7 pawn
4. Maintains flexibility for my queen

Player_Black (to Proxy):

After analyzing the position and available moves, I need to make a strategic decision.

I notice that my king is on g8, and I have a knight on e5 and queen on f6. White has a bishop on c3, a knight on g5, and rooks on d1 and g1. The position appears somewhat tense.

The knight on e5 is well-placed and could potentially fork pieces. My queen on f6 has good control of the board. I should consider improving my position further.

One strong move would be to activate my queen with `f6e6`, controlling the e-file and maintaining flexibility. This keeps pressure on White's position while staying safe.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Now I have a clear picture of the position and my available moves. Let me analyze the situation:

I'm playing as Black and have several options. Looking at the board:
- My king is on g8 with a rook on a8 and h8
- I have a knight on e5 in a good central position
- White has a bishop on c8 that's attacking my position
- White has a rook on d1 and g1, and the king is on e2

Among my legal moves, I should consider:
1. Knight moves from e5 - the knight is well-placed and could potentially create threats
2. Pawn moves to develop my position
3. King safety moves

The bishop on c8 is a concern as it's attacking into my position. My knight on e5 is well-placed but could be even better positioned.

I'll move my knight to c6, which defends my b-pawn and maintains a good central position:

3. The pawn structure shows some exchanges have occurred
4. I need to consider safety and development

Looking at my options, I notice my king is in the corner with both rooks still available. I should prioritize king safety and piece coordination.

The move h8h7 (moving my king from h8 to h7) would be risky as it exposes my king. Moving one of my rooks on the a-file or developing my pawns seems more prudent.

I'll develop my queenside by pushing the c-pawn, which helps control the center and opens lines for my pieces.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

I need to analyze the position carefully before making my move.

Looking at the board:
- I'm playing as Black with my king on g8
- White has a bishop on e5 threatening my position
- White has a knight on g5 that could be dangerous
- I have pawns on b7, c5, f7, g7, and a pawn on a7 (though this appears to be a white pawn on the board display)
- Material seems roughly equal

Key considerations:
1. King safety is a priority
2. The bishop on e5 is controlling important squares
3. I should improve my piece coordination

Among my legal moves, I see several king moves and rook moves. Moving my king to h7 would be risky with White's pieces aimed at the kingside. Moving my f7 pawn could weaken my king position.

I think a solid move would be to improve my rook position with:

make_move a8d8

This centralizes my rook, increases my control of the d-file, and maintains flexibility for my position. The rook will be more active on d8 than on a8.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

After analyzing the position, I can see I'm playing as Black with my king on g8 and rooks on d8 and h8. I have several pawn moves and rook moves available.

The position appears to be in the middlegame/endgame phase. White has a bishop on e5 that's attacking my f7 pawn, and a knight on g5 that's also putting pressure on my kingside.

I notice that my d8 rook is undefended and could be developed. Moving it to the e-file would put pressure on White's king on e5. Additionally, I should consider defending my f7 pawn which is under attack.

I'll play Rd8-e8, which develops my rook to an active file, puts pressure on White's king, and indirectly defends the f7 pawn by pinning the bishop to the king.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Looking at the position and my legal moves, I need to make a strategic decision as Black.

I notice that:
- I'm playing as Black with my king on g8
- White has a bishop on d4, a knight on g5, and rooks on c1 and h1
- I have rooks on e8 and g8, and my king appears to be in a castled position
- There's some pawn tension in the center and kingside

One of my most important priorities is king safety. I see that White's knight on g5 could be threatening my position. I should also consider activating my rooks.

I'll play the move:

make_move e8e5

This move activates my rook to the 5th rank, controlling the center and potentially putting pressure on White's e-pawn. It also maintains flexibility for my position while improving my piece activity.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

I'll analyze the position and make a strong move as Black.

Looking at the board:
- I have a rook on g8 and e5
- White has a knight on e4 threatening my rook on e5
- White has a bishop on d4
- My king is on h7
- Material seems roughly equal

Key considerations:
1. My rook on e5 is under attack by the knight on e4
2. I should either move the rook or defend it
3. I could also consider counterattacks

Among my legal moves, I see several strong candidates:
- e5e8/e7/e6: Moving the rook to safety
- e5f5/g5/h5: Moving the rook laterally (h5 would attack White's h-pawn)
- g7g5: Advancing a pawn to gain space

I think the best move is to move my rook to h5, which both saves the rook from the knight attack and creates a threat against White's h-pawn.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

I can see that I have four legal moves available as Black:

1. h7h8 - Moving my rook from h7 to h8
2. h7h6 - Moving my rook from h7 to h6
3. h5f5 - Moving my rook from h5 to f5
4. g7g6 - Moving my g-pawn from g7 to g6

Let me analyze the position:
- I have two rooks (on h5 and h7) and my king is on g8
- White has a bishop on f6, a knight on e5, and rooks on c1 and h1
- The bishop on f6 is controlling the g7 square, so my g-pawn is pinned against my king

Looking at my options:
- Moving the h7 rook to h8 or h6 doesn't accomplish much
- Moving the h5 rook to f5 would attack White's knight on e5, which seems like a good active move
- Moving g7-g6 would lose material since the pawn is pinned by the bishop on f6

The best move appears to be h5f5, attacking White's knight on e5. This creates a direct threat and puts pressure on White's position.

I notice my rook on f5 is well-positioned and active, controlling the f-file. I should consider:

1. Protecting the f7 pawn which could be vulnerable
2. Improving my king's safety
3. Advancing my pawns when appropriate

Looking at my options, I'll make a move that improves my position:

make_move h7h6

This move creates a luft (breathing space) for my king, preventing any back-rank checkmate threats while maintaining my solid position. It also gives my king an escape square at h7 if needed in the future.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

I need to carefully analyze this position as Black. 

I notice I have a rook on f5 that's actively placed, and another rook on g8. My king is on h6. White has knights on e4 and rooks on a1, c1, and h5. The material seems roughly equal.

Looking at my options, I see a few key considerations:
- My rook on f5 is well-positioned and attacking along the 5th rank
- I should be careful about potential knight forks from e4
- My king on h6 needs to stay safe

One strong move would be to play f5e5, attacking White's knight on e4. This puts pressure on a key piece and improves my position.

You are a professional chess player and you play as black. Now is your turn to make a move. Before making a move you can pick one of the following actions:
- 'get_current_board' to get the schema and current status of the board
- 'get_legal_moves' to get a UCI formatted list of available moves
- 'make_move <UCI formatted move>' when you are ready to complete your turn (e.g., 'make_move e2e4')

1. I'm playing as Black and have two rooks (e5 and g8), my king is on h6, and I have several pawns.
2. White has three rooks (c1, e1, h5) and a knight on e4, with the king on e2.
3. I notice my rook on e5 is attacking White's knight on e4, which is undefended.

The strongest move appears to be capturing the undefended knight with my rook:

1. My rook on e4 is active and can attack along the e-file or 4th rank
2. I have a rook on g8 that could be developed
3. My king on h6 is relatively safe

The most powerful move appears to be using my rook on e4 to attack along the e-file, particularly targeting e8 which would put pressure on White's position.

I notice I have a strong position with connected rooks on the back rank. One good option would be to centralize my king, which is currently on the edge of the board.

I'll move my king from h6 to g6, improving its position while maintaining control of important squares:

I'll analyze the position as Black:

The position shows I have my king on g6, rooks on e8 and g8, and pawns on b7, c5, f7, g4, and g7. White has rooks on h5 and e1, king on f1, and pawns on a4, c3, and h4.

Looking at my options:
- I have control of the e-file with my rook on e8
- My king is relatively safe on g6
- I should consider improving my position or creating threats

One strong move is to double my rooks on the e-file, which would increase pressure on White's position and potentially target the e1 rook:

Player_Black (to Proxy):

I apologize for the error. It seems I misread the board. Let me try again with a valid move from the legal moves list.

Looking at the position more carefully, I see that I already have a rook on e8, so doubling rooks on the e-file would require moving my g8 rook to the e-file. Let me select a strong move from the legal moves provided:

Looking at my options:
- I have control of the 8th rank with my rooks
- My king is relatively active on g6
- I should consider the safety of my king and potential threats

One strong move would be to connect my rooks, which provides better coordination and defends the g8 rook.

- Material is roughly equal, but I need to be careful about White's rook

Key considerations:
1. King safety is important - my king is somewhat exposed
2. I should look for active moves with my rooks
3. I should consider pawn advances that might help create a passed pawn

Among my options:
- Moving my king to h7 would be safer
- Centralizing a rook with f8d8 could be strong
- Advancing pawns like f7-f5 could gain space

After evaluation, I'll centralize my rook to increase its activity and control more of the board.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

I need to analyze this position carefully. 

I'm playing as Black and I notice:
- I have my king on g6 with rooks on d8 and g8
- White has a rook on d3 and king on g2
- The position looks to be in the endgame phase

Looking at my options, I need to consider both defensive and offensive possibilities. The white rook on d3 is currently controlling the d-file, so one good option would be to contest that file with my rook.

I'll play the move:

After analyzing the position and my legal moves, I see several key considerations:

1. I have two rooks - one on d3 and one on g8
2. My king is on g6, relatively safe for now
3. I have several pawn moves available

Looking at the position, I notice my rook on d3 is active and controlling the d-file. I should consider using it to create threats or gain control of more territory. The white king is on h1, which gives me potential attacking chances.

One of the strongest moves appears to be pushing my rook up the d-file to apply pressure and potentially create threats against White's position.

After analyzing the position, I can see I'm playing as Black with my king on g6, rooks on g8 and d7, and several pawns. White's king is on h1, and the material is roughly equal.

I notice I have good control of the board with my rooks. My king on g6 is relatively safe, but I should be careful about potential checks.

Looking at my options, I'll improve my rook position with:

make_move d7d1

This move puts my rook on the first rank, attacking White's position and potentially setting up checkmate threats. It also maintains control of the d-file while putting pressure on White's king position.

I notice several strong options:
- I could play d1d8 to control the 8th rank
- I could play g8h8 to connect my rooks
- I could advance my pawns with moves like c5c4

The most immediate priority appears to be improving my rook position and potentially creating threats. I'll connect my rooks, which is generally a good principle in endgames.

As Black, I have:
- My king on g6
- Rooks on h8 and e5
- Pawns on b7, c5, f7, g7, g4

White has:
- King on f1
- Pawns on a4, c3, h4

Looking at my legal moves, I need to make a strategic decision. The rook on h8 can move to h5, which would attack White's h4 pawn. My king can move in several directions.

Since I have a material advantage with two rooks versus no major pieces for White, I should use my rooks actively. Moving the h8 rook to h5 would attack White's h4 pawn and increase my rook's activity.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

After analyzing the position, I see several strong options:

1. My rook on e2 has an open file and can create threats
2. My rook on h5 controls the h-file and can potentially attack
3. I have a passed g-pawn that could be advanced

The most decisive move appears to be using my rook on e2 to deliver checkmate:

I'll make a strong move with my rook on h5, creating an immediate threat while maintaining control of the position:

make_move h5h2

This move attacks White's second rank and puts pressure on White's position. It threatens to check the White king if it moves away from f2, and creates potential mating threats. This is a strong active move that improves my position while restricting White's options.

Looking at the legal moves, I notice my rook on h2 has many options. The most powerful move appears to be to deliver checkmate with the rook.

I'll move my rook to h1, which delivers checkmate since the White king on g1 has nowhere to go.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

After analyzing the position and my legal moves, I see I have a rook on h1 that's completely free to move along the h-file and the first rank. I also have my king on g6 with several safe squares available.

Looking at the position strategically, I notice that:
1. My rook on h1 is very powerful and can potentially checkmate the white king
2. White's king is on g2, which gives me an opportunity to use my rook effectively

The strongest move here is to place my rook on h2+, giving check to the white king. This will force the white king to move, and I can potentially follow up with a checkmate sequence or win material.

My rook on h2 is very active and controls the h-file. I should consider using it to create threats or gain material. Looking at the legal moves, I notice I can play h2h1+, which would deliver check to the White king.

This check would force the White king to move, giving me tempo to improve my position further. Since the White king is already on the back rank, this check could lead to a decisive advantage.

After analyzing the position, I can see that I'm playing as Black with my king on g6 and a rook on h1. I have several pawn moves available, but the most powerful piece I have is the rook on h1.

Looking at the position, I notice that White's king is on f2, and there's no piece between my rook and White's king. This means I can deliver a checkmate immediately by moving my rook to f1.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Now I can see all my legal moves. Let me analyze the position:

I have a rook on f1 with no immediate threats, and my king is on g6. I notice my rook is on the same file as White's king on g2, but separated by one file. I can potentially create threats with my rook.

Looking at the available moves, I see I can play Rf2+, which would give check to the White king. This is a strong move as it forces the king to move and could potentially lead to material gain or a better position.

I'll make this move:

Player_Black (to Proxy):

I need to analyze this position carefully as Black.

Looking at the board:
- I'm playing as Black with my king on g6
- White's king is on f2
- I have pawns on b7, c5, f7, and g4
- White has pawns on a4 and c3

The position appears to be in the endgame phase. My king is more active than White's, which is a significant advantage. I should consider:

1. King moves to maintain flexibility
2. Pawn advances that could create passed pawns
3. Preventing White's counterplay

Among my options, advancing the g-pawn looks promising as it creates a passed pawn that could become a queen. Moving my king to support this pawn is also strategic.

I'll make the move:

4. White has pawns on a4 and c3

Looking at my options, I need to consider:
- King safety
- Pawn advancement
- Overall position improvement

The most promising move appears to be advancing my g3 pawn to g2, which threatens to promote. This creates an immediate threat that White must respond to.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Now I can see all my legal moves. Let me analyze the position and make the best move:

I have a significant material advantage with my queen versus no major pieces for White. The position is quite winning for me.

Key observations:
1. My king is safe on g6
2. My queen on g1 is very active
3. White's king is on f3

The most direct path to victory is to use my queen to either checkmate or win more material. Looking at the legal moves, I see several strong queen moves that put pressure on White.

I'll go with a powerful queen move to g3+, which checks the White king and forces it to move, after which I can continue the attack.

After analyzing the position, I see that I'm playing as Black with my king on g6 and queen on e5. White's king is on f3, and there are various pawns for both sides.

I notice an immediate checkmate opportunity: I can move my queen to f4, which would be checkmate since the White king on f3 would be in check with no legal moves.

I have several strong options, but the most decisive appears to be a queen check that will lead to material gain or checkmate. I'll play:

make_move e5f4

This move checks the White king while also attacking the c7 square, creating multiple threats. If White moves the king, I can potentially capture the c3 pawn with check or create other tactical threats. This puts maximum pressure on White's position.

This looks like a winning position for Black. I should use my queen effectively since it's the strongest piece on the board. Looking at the legal moves, I notice I can:

1. Attack the white king directly with Qf4-f2, putting it in check
2. Control more space with my queen
3. Advance my pawns

Looking at my legal moves, I need to consider my king safety and pawn structure. Since my king is already relatively active on g6, I should consider either improving its position or advancing my pawns strategically.

In this endgame position, activating the king is crucial. Moving my king to h6 would maintain its central influence while staying safe.

- Creating passed pawns

The c5 pawn is my most advanced piece and could potentially become a passed pawn. Advancing it would put pressure on White and force their attention to stopping it.

- A pawn on c3
- White's king on d2

The move g7-g5 looks strong as it:
1. Creates a connected passed pawn structure with my c4 pawn
2. Controls more space
3. Starts advancing toward promotion

Now I can see my legal moves. Let me analyze the position:

I'm playing as Black with my king on h6 (not g6 as I initially thought), and I have pawns on b7, f7, and g5. White has a king on c1 and pawns on a4 and c3.

Looking at the position strategically:
1. My king is currently active on h6
2. I should try to advance my pawns, particularly the g5 pawn which is most advanced
3. I need to be careful not to allow White's king to capture my pawns

The move g5-g4 looks strong as it advances my most forward pawn. This will create a passed pawn that could potentially promote. Since White's king is far away on c1, it cannot stop this pawn's advance immediately.

Now I can see the board position. I'm playing as Black and I have a king on g6, and pawns on b7, f7, c5, and g5. White has a king on d1, pawns on a4 and c3.

Let me check what legal moves I have available.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Thank you for providing the legal moves. I can now analyze the position and make my decision.

Looking at the board and my available moves, I notice:
- My king is on h6 (not g6 as I initially thought)
- I have pawns on b7, f7, c5, and g4
- White has pawns on a4 and c3, with the king on d1

Since White's king is far away on d1, I should try to advance one of my pawns toward promotion. The g-pawn is the most advanced, so I'll push it forward.

I need to analyze this position carefully. 

I see that I'm playing as Black with my king on h6, and pawns on b7, f7, c4, and g3. White has a king on e2 and pawns on a4 and c3.

Looking at my options:
- My g3 pawn is advanced and could be promoted with g3g2 followed by g2g1
- My king on h6 has several moves but needs to stay relatively close to my pawns
- My f7 and b7 pawns can advance

The most critical move appears to be pushing my g3 pawn, which is closest to promotion.

- Pawn moves: f7f6, f7f5, b7b6, b7b5

Since this appears to be an endgame position, I should consider:
1. Advancing my pawns to create passed pawns
2. Using my king actively
3. Preventing White's counterplay

I'll advance my f-pawn two squares to create a passed pawn and open up possibilities for my king to support it.

2. I have a pawn on f5 that can advance to f4
3. I have a pawn on b7 that can move one or two squares forward

Looking at the position, I should focus on advancing my pawns to create passed pawns for promotion. The f5 pawn is already quite advanced.

I'll advance my f-pawn to increase my advantage and create a passed pawn threat.

2. My pawn on f4 can advance to f3, putting pressure on White
3. My pawn on b7 can advance to either b6 or b5
4. My pawn on c4 is already advanced but blocked by White's c3 pawn

The most active move appears to be advancing the f-pawn, which creates a passed pawn threat and could potentially promote. This is likely my strongest asset in this position.

I see that I have the following options:
- King moves: h6h7, h6g7, h6g6, h6h5, h6g5
- Pawn moves: b7b6, b7b5, f3f2

Wait, there seems to be a discrepancy. In the board representation, my king appears to be on g6, but the legal moves suggest it's on h6. Also, there's a move f3f2 listed, but I don't see a pawn on f3 in the board representation (I see one on f5).

Let me make the best move based on the legal moves provided. Since advancing pawns toward promotion is usually good, and f3f2 would be just one step away from promotion:

Thank you for providing the legal moves. Let me analyze the position:

I notice I have a pawn on f2 that can promote immediately, which is clearly my strongest move. Among the promotion options, promoting to a queen gives me the most powerful piece.

I also have my king on h6 with several possible moves, and a pawn on b7 that can move forward or make a double step.

The best move is clearly to promote my f2 pawn to a queen:

I see the position now. I'm playing as Black and have a queen on f1, king on h6, and pawns on b7 and c4. White has a king on h4, pawns on a4 and c3. This looks like an endgame position where I might have an advantage with my queen.

Let me check what legal moves I have available.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Now I can see all my legal moves. Let me analyze the position strategically:

1. I have a queen vs no queen, which is a decisive advantage
2. My priority should be to use the queen effectively while keeping my king safe
3. I should look for a move that either:
   - Checks the white king
   - Controls key squares
   - Advances my pawns safely

Looking at the moves, I see that I can check the white king with Qf1-h3+. This would put immediate pressure on White and force a king move. This is a good attacking move that restricts White's king.

- Black pawns on b7 and c4
- White king on g2
- White pawns on a4 and c3

Let me check what legal moves I have as Black.

Now I understand my options as Black. I have the following legal moves:
- King moves: h6h7, h6g7, h6g6, h6h5, h6g5
- Pawn moves: b7b6, b7b5

Let me analyze the position:
1. My king is on h6 (not g6 as I initially thought)
2. I have pawns on b7 and c4
3. White has pawns on a4 and c3, with the king on g2

The most important strategic decision is what to do with my b7 pawn. Advancing it could create a passed pawn which might be decisive. The c4 pawn is already advanced and putting pressure on White's c3 pawn.

I'll advance my b-pawn two squares to create a passed pawn threat that White will need to address.

3. There appears to be another pawn at c4 (based on the board display)
4. White's king is on g5

This is a critical endgame position. My priority should be to advance my pawns while keeping my king active. The b-pawn is particularly important as it's more advanced.

I'll move my b-pawn forward to continue its advance toward promotion:

- White has a king on f5
- White has pawns on a4 and c5
- I (Black) have pawns on b4 and c4

Let me check what legal moves I have available.

Now I understand my available moves. I have:
1. King moves: h6h7, h6g7, h6h5
2. Pawn moves: b4c3 (capture), b4b3 (advance)

Let me analyze this position:
- This is a critical endgame position
- My king is currently on h6 (not g6 as I initially thought)
- White's king is on f5, controlling key squares
- The pawn structure is important for the outcome

The move b4c3 looks promising as it would capture White's pawn on c5, creating a passed pawn. However, I need to ensure this is actually a capture and not just an illegal move. Based on the board representation, there appears to be a White pawn on c5 that I can capture with my b4 pawn.

I'll make this capture to create a passed pawn, which should give me good winning chances in this endgame.

h6h7,h6g7,h6g6,h6h5,h6g5,c3c2

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

I notice there's a discrepancy between the board display and the legal moves. The board shows pawns on c4 and c5, but the legal moves include c3c2, suggesting a pawn on c3. Let me analyze the actual position based on the legal moves.

Looking at my options:
- I can move my king (h6) to h7, g7, g6, h5, or g5
- I can advance my pawn from c3 to c2

This is a critical endgame position. My pawn on c3 is quite advanced and close to promotion. The key decision is whether to push the pawn or improve my king position.

Since my pawn is already on c3 and can advance to c2, it's very close to queening. White's king is on e6, which is too far away to stop my c-pawn from promoting. White's a4 pawn is not as advanced as mine.

The best move is to advance my pawn toward promotion:

After analyzing the position and my legal moves, I see several strong options:

1. I can capture the white king with my queen: e3d4
2. I can check the white king with my queen: e3d3, e3e4, etc.

Since capturing the king would end the game immediately (though this is technically not allowed in standard chess rules), I'll make the most decisive move:

- Black king on g6
- White king on d4
- White pawn on a4
- Black pawn on c4

Let me check what legal moves I have as Black.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Now I understand my options as Black. This is a critical endgame position where I need to make the right decision.

Looking at the position:
1. My king is on h6 and can move to h7, g7, g6, h5, or g5
2. My pawn on c4 can advance to c3
3. White has a pawn on a4 and king on d4

Analysis:
- The white pawn is quite advanced, so I need to consider if I should push my pawn or use my king
- My pawn is closer to promotion than White's pawn
- I need to decide whether to advance my pawn or move my king to stop White's pawn

The best move here is to advance my pawn to c3, as this creates an immediate threat of promotion. White will need to respond to this threat, giving me tempo.

Now I can see my legal moves. I'm playing as Black with my king on h6 (not g6 as I initially thought) and a pawn on c3.

This is a critical endgame position. My goal should be to promote my pawn if possible, while preventing White's pawn from promoting.

Looking at the position:
- My pawn on c3 is much closer to promotion than White's pawn on a4
- I can advance my pawn immediately with c3c2, getting one step closer to queening

The best move is clear - I should advance my pawn:

I see that White has played b2-b4, which is known as the Sokolsky Opening or Polish Opening. This is an uncommon first move that aims to control the c5 square and potentially develop the bishop to b2.

Let's check my legal moves to respond to this.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Looking at the available moves, I need to respond to White's b4 opening. 

As a professional chess player, I have several good options:

1. e7e5 - Taking central control with a classical approach
2. d7d5 - Also controlling the center
3. c7c5 - Directly challenging White's b4 pawn
4. g8f6 - Developing a knight to a good square
5. e7e6 - Preparing for a solid defense

Among these, c7c5 is particularly thematic against b4, as it immediately challenges White's plan. This move follows sound opening principles by fighting for the center and putting pressure on White's advance.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

After analyzing the position, I see that White has played an early b4, which is the Polish (Sokolsky) Opening. I have already responded with c5, which directly challenges White's pawn.

One of the strongest responses here is to capture the b4 pawn with c5xb4. This would win a pawn and give me an early advantage. White might try to complicate with a3, but after b4-a3, I would have good development options.

I'll make this capture:

2. White has developed a knight to c3 and pushed g2-g3, likely planning a fianchetto with the bishop.
3. As Black, I should focus on development and controlling the center.

The most principled move here is 1...Nf6 (g8f6), developing a knight to a good square, controlling the center, and preparing for kingside castling. This is a standard developing move that follows opening principles.

1. White has captured my c-pawn with their knight on c3
2. White has also captured my pawn on e4
3. I have a knight on f6 that could recapture the pawn on e4

Recapturing the pawn on e4 with my knight (f6e4) looks like the most natural move here. It regains material equality and develops my knight to a central square. This is a standard principle in chess openings - when your opponent captures a center pawn, recapturing to maintain control of the center is often best.

I need to analyze this position carefully. 

I notice White's queen is on h4, which is quite aggressive. My knight on e4 is well-placed and attacking several squares. I also see that my pawn structure has been altered with the c-pawn missing and my b-pawn advanced to b4.

Looking at the legal moves, I have several good options:
1. I could develop my knight with Nc6 (b8c6)
2. I could move my queen to safety and development with Qc7 (d8c7)
3. I could capture a pawn with my b4 pawn (b4c3)
4. I could make a central pawn push like e5 or d5

The capture b4c3 looks particularly attractive as it would win a pawn and disrupt White's pawn structure. This is a strong move that would give me material advantage.

I'll make this move:

make_move b4c3

You are a professional chess player and you play as black. Now is your turn to make a move. Before making a move you can pick one of the following actions:
- 'get_current_board' to get the schema and current status of the board
- 'get_legal_moves' to get a UCI formatted list of available moves
- 'make_move <UCI formatted move>' when you are ready to complete your turn (e.g., 'make_move e2e4')

Player_Black (to Proxy):

I see all my legal moves now. Looking at the position, I notice White's queen on h4 is creating some pressure, and I need to respond appropriately.

The knight on e4 is well-placed and attacking White's territory. I should consider if it needs protection or if I can use it for a tactical advantage. I also need to continue my development and ensure my king's safety.

One strong move would be to develop my knight from b8 to c6, which develops a piece, controls the center, and prepares for castling. This is a natural developing move that follows good chess principles.

Looking at the legal moves, I should prioritize development and king safety. The most pressing issue is completing my development while ensuring my king is safe.

I'll develop my bishop and prepare to castle:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Thank you for providing the legal moves. Let me analyze the position more carefully.

I notice that White has a potentially dangerous attack building on my kingside with the queen on h4 and bishop on d3. This could lead to a checkmate threat if not addressed properly.

One of my priorities should be to defend against potential threats on h7, which is currently only defended by my king. The move h7-h6 would provide additional protection to that square.

I also need to continue my development and potentially castle to safety.

After considering the options, I'll play:

make_move h7h6

This move:
1. Defends against the potential threat on h7
2. Creates a luft (escape square) for my king if I castle kingside
3. Prevents White from placing a piece on g5 which could be annoying

After analyzing the position and legal moves, I notice several important factors:

1. White's queen on h4 is threatening my position
2. My queen on f6 can capture the white queen with f6h4
3. This would be a favorable exchange as queens are equal in value

This is a clear opportunity to capture White's queen with my own, which is a strong move in this position.

One of the strongest moves here is to move my knight on g4 to f6, which:
- Defends against potential threats
- Improves my knight's position to a classic strong square
- Maintains control of important central squares

1. White's queen on b4 is threatening my knight on c6
2. My queen on h4 is under attack by White's g3 pawn
3. I have an opportunity to capture White's bishop on h7 with my knight

Looking at the critical threats, I need to address the queen threat to my knight and save my own queen. The move that stands out is:

make_move h4b4

This captures White's queen with my queen, eliminating a major threat and gaining significant material advantage. This is a straightforward capture that wins a queen for free, which should give me a decisive advantage in the game.

1. Places my queen on a more central square
2. Controls important central squares

1. White's queen on b4 is threatening my knight on c6
2. White's knight on e4 is centralized and threatening squares
3. I need to address these threats while developing my pieces

One of the strongest moves here is to capture White's knight with my knight:

make_move f6e4

This move:
1. Captures White's centralized knight
2. Removes a dangerous piece from the center
3. Develops my knight to a good square
4. Creates counterplay against White's position

If White recaptures with a pawn, it would damage their pawn structure. This is a principled move that follows good chess strategy by removing a well-placed enemy piece.

After analyzing the position and my legal moves, I need to address the immediate threat from White's queen on b7, which is attacking my a7 pawn and potentially threatening my position.

I'll defend the a7 pawn while developing a piece:

make_move a8b8

This move defends the a7 pawn from the queen's attack and connects my rooks. It's a solid developing move that addresses the immediate threat while improving my piece coordination.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

After analyzing the position, I can see several important features:

1. White has a queen on c7, which is attacking my pawn on a7
2. I have two knights - one on c6 and one on e4
3. White has a bishop on b2 that's controlling the long diagonal
4. My king is on e8 with limited mobility

Looking at my options, I notice my knight on e4 is well-positioned and can make several strong moves. In particular, the knight on e4 can fork White's king and rook with Nf2+.

This check would force White to move their king and then I could capture the rook on the next move, gaining material advantage.

This move defends the a7 pawn from the queen's attack while keeping my rook active on the open a-file. It's a solid defensive move that maintains my position without creating any weaknesses.

After analyzing the position, I see I'm playing as Black and I'm in a complex middlegame. White has a queen on b2 and has some pressure, but I have knights on e7 and f2, with the f2 knight being particularly active and forked against White's king and rook.

My most powerful move appears to be the knight fork on f2, which is threatening both White's king on e1 and rook on g1. I should capitalize on this tactical opportunity.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

I see all my legal moves now. Let me analyze the position:

I'm playing as Black and I notice several important features:
- White has a queen on e3 that's quite active
- I have a knight on d1 that's deep in White's territory, putting pressure on White's position
- My king is on e8 and seems relatively safe
- I have a knight on e7 that could be developed better

Looking at my options, I see a strong move with my knight on d1. It can fork White's king on e3 and rook on c3 by moving to:

After analyzing the position, I notice several important factors:
- White's queen is on e5, creating pressure
- My knight on f2 has several good options
- My king is on e8 and could potentially be in danger

The knight on f2 is particularly interesting as it's deep in White's territory and has several strong moves available. I'll use it to create a threat.

I'll play the knight from f2 to e4, which attacks White's queen and creates a strong central presence.

After analyzing the position, I notice several important features:
- White has a queen on c7, threatening my position
- I have two knights, one on e7 and one on e4
- My king is on e8 and appears to be under pressure

One of my most pressing concerns is the white queen on c7, which is attacking my position. I should consider either defending against its threats or creating counterplay.

Looking at my knight on e4, it has several strong options. Moving it to f2 would create a fork on White's king and rook, which would be a decisive tactical blow.

4. My king's safety is a priority

Among my legal moves, capturing the rook with the knight (f2h1) stands out as the strongest option. This captures a rook for free, which is a significant material gain.

After analyzing the position, I see several key factors:

1. My king on e8 is in check from the white bishop on e5
2. I need to address this check immediately
3. I have several options to deal with the check:
   - Move the king to f7 (e8f7)
   - Block with the knight by moving it to d5 (e7d5)
   - Capture the bishop with the knight (e7e5) - but this isn't in the legal moves list

The safest and most developing move appears to be moving my king to f7, which gets out of check and maintains my position.

Looking at my options, I should prioritize king safety and piece coordination. The knight on e7 is under attack from the bishop on e4, so I should move it. Moving it to c6 develops the piece to a good central square and protects the d-pawn.

- My king is on f7
- White has a bishop on e5 that's attacking diagonally
- I have knights on c6 and h1

Looking at my options, I should prioritize safety and development. The knight on h1 is quite exposed and should be moved to a more useful position. Moving it to g3 would put pressure on White's position.

You are a professional chess player and you play as black. Now is your turn to make a move. Before making a move you can pick one of the following actions:
- 'get_current_board' to get the schema and current status of the board
- 'get_legal_moves' to get a UCI formatted list of available moves
- 'make_move <UCI formatted move>' when you are ready to complete your turn (e.g., 'make_move e2e4')

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

After analyzing the position and my legal moves, I can see several key considerations:

1. My king on f7 is somewhat exposed, so improving its safety is important
2. White has a bishop on e5 that's attacking into my position
3. I have two knights that could be developed better

Among my options, I notice I can move my king to a safer position with f7e7, which would also connect my rooks. This is a solid developing move that improves my king safety.

Another strong option is to challenge White's bishop with c6e5, capturing a piece and removing a threat.

After consideration, I'll capture the bishop on e5 with my knight, which removes an attacking piece and improves my position.

After analyzing the position, I can see several interesting options. I notice my knight on g3 has some active possibilities, and I also have some pawn moves to consider.

The knight on g3 is particularly well-positioned and could create threats by moving to e4, putting pressure on the center. This would also attack the white pawn on c3.

After analyzing the position, I see that I'm playing as Black with my king on f7. White has a rook on h1 and another on c1, with the white king on e1.

I notice I have two knights - one on e5 and one on e4, which are both active pieces. My pawn structure is somewhat compromised, but I have control of some key squares.

One of my strongest moves would be to develop my knight on e4 to f6, which would protect my king and control important central squares. This knight move would increase my control of the center while adding protection to my kingside.

- I have two knights (on f6 and e5) that are active
- White has a rook on d1 that could become dangerous
- There's a pawn on c3 that could be targeted

Looking at my options, I want to improve my position. The knight on e5 has several good options, including a potential fork with Ne5-c4 which would attack White's a-pawn and potentially threaten other pieces.

I'll make this move:

I notice my knight on c4 is active and can make several strong moves. I also have control of the f-file with my bishop on f8. My king is on f7 and appears relatively safe.

Looking at the potential knight moves from c4, I can develop pressure on White's position. The move c4e3 looks particularly strong as it attacks White's king on e5 while also potentially threatening a fork.

I'll make this move:

I notice several key aspects of the position:
- My king is on f7 with some pawn protection
- I have two knights (on f6 and e3) that could be developed further
- White has a rook on c1 and h1, and the king is on e2

One of my strongest pieces is the knight on e3, which is centralized and putting pressure on White's position. I can improve my position by moving my other knight to a better square.

The move f6d5 looks particularly strong as it:
1. Centralizes my knight
2. Attacks White's c3 pawn
3. Maintains control of key central squares

I notice that:
- I'm playing as Black with my king on f7
- White has a rook on c1 and h1, with the king on e2
- I have a knight on d5 that has several good options
- The position seems somewhat open

Looking at my options, the knight on d5 has many promising moves. In particular, the knight can fork White's king on e2 and rook on c1 with the move Nd5-c3+.

This would give check to the White king and simultaneously attack the rook on c1, which would be a strong tactical move.

After analyzing the position, I see I'm playing as Black with my king on f7. White has just a few pieces left (king on f2, rooks on c1 and h1, and some pawns), while I have more material with my rooks, bishop, knight, and pawns.

I notice my knight on c3 is active and can make several strong moves. One particularly good move is to play c3e4, attacking White's e-pawn while developing my knight to a more central square.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

I need to analyze this position carefully. As Black, I have a knight on e4 and my king on f7. Let me evaluate my options:

1. Knight moves (e4f6 or e4f2):
   - e4f6 would move my knight to a safer square, but doesn't create immediate threats
   - e4f2 is interesting - it attacks White's rook on f6 and could potentially fork pieces

2. King moves (f7g8, f7e8, or f7e7):
   - My king seems somewhat exposed, so improving its position could be good
   - f7g8 moves to the corner which is often safer
   - f7e8 or f7e7 move toward the queenside

Looking at the position, I notice White has a rook on f6 that's currently attacking my king's position. Moving my knight to f2 would attack this rook while potentially setting up a fork.

I'll make this aggressive move:

2. My king is on f7 and needs to be careful
3. There's a white rook on d1 that could be threatening

Among my options, I see several strong candidates:
- Moving my knight from f2 to a safer square while maintaining activity
- Developing my rook from h8
- Advancing pawns to gain space

The knight on f2 is particularly powerful, but also potentially vulnerable. I'll move it to a safer but still active square.

- My king is on f7
- White has a rook on d1 that could be threatening
- I have two bishops (c8 and f8)

One of my strongest moves appears to be the knight on d3, which is well-positioned and has several good options. The move Nd3-e5 looks particularly strong as it:
1. Attacks the center
2. Creates a protected outpost for my knight
3. Could potentially threaten White's king on e2

I need to analyze the position carefully before making my move.

Looking at the board, I notice:
- I'm playing as Black with my king on f7
- White has a rook on d1 and king on f1
- I have knights, bishops, rooks, and pawns available
- The position appears to be in the middlegame/endgame phase

Among my options, I should consider:
1. Knight moves (e5 to various squares)
2. Pawn advances
3. King safety
4. Piece development

The knight on e5 is well-positioned and could potentially fork pieces. Moving it to c4 would attack White's a-pawn while maintaining a central position.

1. I'm playing as Black and my king is on f7
2. White has a rook on d4 that's attacking my position
3. I have a knight on c4 that's currently undefended
4. White's king is on f1

Looking at my options, I notice my knight on c4 is attacking White's rook on d4. However, the rook is protected by the pawn on a4. I should consider either moving my knight to safety or finding a strong move.

One of the best moves appears to be moving my knight to e3, which creates a fork between White's king on f1 and the rook on d4. This would force White to either move the king or lose the rook.

Let me analyze the position:

I'm playing as Black, and I notice several key aspects of the position:
- My king is on f7, somewhat exposed
- I have a knight on e3 that's actively placed in White's territory
- White has a rook on d4 and king on g1
- The position is quite open

Looking at my options, the knight on e3 has several strong moves. I could consider:
- e3f5: Developing the knight to a good outpost
- e3g4: Threatening White's h-pawn
- e3c4: Attacking White's rook on d4

I also have pawn moves to consider for development and space. 

The most active and promising move appears to be attacking White's rook with my knight:

Looking at my legal moves, I should prioritize king safety while maintaining active piece coordination. The knight on c4 has several good options, including e5 which would attack the white rook.

After careful consideration, I'll move my knight to e5, creating a threat against the white rook while improving my piece position.

- White has a rook on d4 that's quite active
- I have a knight on c4 that's well-positioned and attacking White's a-pawn
- My king is on f7 and seems relatively safe
- I have bishops on c8 and f8

Looking at my options, I see several strong candidate moves:

1. Knight moves: My knight on c4 is active and has several good options. Moving to e3 would fork White's king and potentially other pieces.
2. King safety: Moving my king to e7 could improve its position.
3. Bishop development: Developing my bishop from f8 to e7 would connect my rooks.

After evaluation, I believe the best move is to play the knight fork:

1. Attack White's rook with e3d5 or e3c4
2. Create a fork with e3g4 (potentially threatening king and rook)
3. Move e3f5 to a strong central outpost

The move e3f5 looks particularly appealing as it:
- Controls important central squares
- Can't be easily attacked by pawns
- Maintains pressure on White's position

I'll make this move:

Player_Black (to Proxy):

I'll analyze the position and my available moves:

The position appears to be in the middlegame/endgame transition with reduced material. As Black, I need to consider:
1. My king safety (currently on f7)
2. Knight activity (knight on d4 is well-placed)
3. Piece coordination
4. Potential threats

My knight on d4 is very active and centralized. It has several good options including f5, c6, and e2. Moving to f5 would put pressure on White's position and control important squares.

I also notice my king on f7 could use improvement in its position, and my rooks aren't connected.

After evaluating the options, I'll make a move with my knight to f5, which increases my control of the center and puts pressure on White's position.

You are a professional chess player and you play as black. Now is your turn to make a move. Before making a move you can pick one of the following actions:
- 'get_current_board' to get the schema and current status of the board
- 'get_legal_moves' to get a UCI formatted list of available moves
- 'make_move <UCI formatted move>' when you are ready to complete your turn (e.g., 'make_move e2e4')

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

I'll analyze the position:

I'm playing as Black and I notice:
- White has a rook on b5 and pawns on a4, c3, and h4
- My king is on f7, and I have knights, bishops, and rooks available
- The knight on f5 is attacked by White's pawn on c3 (diagonal attack)
- I need to consider both safety and development

The knight on f5 is under attack by the c3 pawn, so I should either move it or defend it. Looking at the knight's options, Nd4 looks strong as it:
1. Escapes the attack
2. Centralizes the knight
3. Creates potential threats against White's position

I'll make this move:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

After analyzing the position, I see several important factors:

1. My knight on d4 is under attack by the white pawn on c3
2. White's rook on b4 is active and potentially threatening
3. I need to improve my position and ensure my king's safety

Among my options, I should prioritize saving the knight on d4, as it's a valuable piece. The knight has several escape squares, and I should choose the one that gives it the most activity.

The move Nd4-f5 looks particularly strong as it:
- Saves the knight
- Places it on a central square with good control
- Potentially threatens White's position

- I have a knight on f5 that has several good options
- My king is on f7, and I should consider its safety

Among my options, I see that my knight on f5 has several strong moves. The move Nf5-d4 looks particularly appealing as it:
1. Centralizes my knight
2. Attacks White's c-pawn
3. Could potentially fork pieces later

This is a strong square for my knight that improves my position.

2. I have a knight on d4 that's quite active in White's territory
3. My king is on f7 and seems relatively safe at the moment
4. Material appears roughly equal

Looking at my options, I notice several strong knight moves from d4. The knight on d4 is my most active piece, and I should use it effectively. The move Nd4-f5 looks particularly strong as it:
- Attacks the center
- Puts pressure on White's position
- Develops toward a strong outpost

I'll analyze the position as Black:

The position appears to be in the middlegame with material roughly equal. I notice my king is on f7, which is somewhat exposed. White has a rook on b4 that's active, and I have a knight on f5 that's well-positioned.

Looking at my options:
- I should improve my king safety
- I could develop my remaining pieces
- I should consider countering White's activity

Among my legal moves, I see several strong candidates:
- `f7e8`: Moving my king to a safer square
- `f5d6`: Repositioning my knight to a central square
- `f8e7`: Developing my bishop to protect my king

After consideration, I believe the best move is to improve my king's safety by moving it to e8, away from the open f-file.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Thank you for providing the legal moves. Let me analyze the position:

I'm playing as Black and I notice:
- I have a knight on d4 that has several good options
- White has a rook on b4 that's somewhat active
- My king is on e8 with castling still available (h8g8 is in the move list)
- I have some pawn structure issues with doubled pawns on the g-file

One of my strongest moves would be to castle kingside with h8g8 (O-O), which would improve my king safety and connect my rooks. This is generally a priority in the middlegame.

Another good option would be to develop my bishop with f8e7 or use my knight on d4 to attack with moves like d4f5 or d4c6.

After consideration, I'll prioritize king safety and castle kingside:

You are a professional chess player and you play as black. Now is your turn to make a move. Before making a move you can pick one of the following actions:
- 'get_current_board' to get the schema and current status of the board
- 'get_legal_moves' to get a UCI formatted list of available moves

Player_Black (to Proxy):

After analyzing the position, I can see I'm playing as Black and have several interesting options. 

The position appears to be in the middle game with material roughly equal. White has a rook on g4 and the king on g2, while I have my king on e8 and a knight on d4 that seems to be in a strong central position.

My knight on d4 has several good options, including d4f5 which would attack White's rook on g7. I also notice my bishop on f8 has mobility.

I'll choose to develop my knight to f5, which puts pressure on White's rook and improves my piece positioning:

Looking at my options, I can either move the knight or capture the rook. The move f5g3 looks particularly strong as it would be a knight fork attacking White's king on g1 and another piece.

1. White has a rook on g3 that's attacking my g7 pawn
2. My king is on e8
3. I have a knight on g6 near the white king on f6
4. The position looks unusual with many pieces missing

Let me check what legal moves I have available.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Thank you for providing the legal moves. Let me analyze the position and make a decision.

I notice that my knight on g6 has several possible moves (g6h5, g6f5, g6e4, etc.), which suggests it's actually on g3, not g6 as I initially thought. This must be my knight that has advanced deep into White's territory.

Looking at the position and available moves:

1. My king on e8 is safe for now, but I should consider development and safety
2. I have a bishop on f8 with several diagonal moves available
3. My knight on g3 is active and near the white king on f6
4. White's rook on g3 (that I initially saw) must actually be my knight

Given these options, I'll develop my bishop and protect my king by moving:

2. My knight on g3 is active and has several good options
3. I have two bishops that could be developed further

The knight on g3 is particularly well-positioned and can make some strong moves. One of the best options is to move it to e4, where it would:
- Attack the center
- Potentially fork pieces later
- Be protected by my pawn on e6

This is a strong developing move that improves my position.

- White has a rook on f6 that's quite active
- I have a knight on e4 that's centralized and could be useful
- My king is on e8 with castling still possible
- I have bishops on e7 and e6

Looking at my options, I notice I could:
1. Castle kingside with g8h8
2. Develop my knight on e4 with potential threats
3. Move my bishop on e7 to a more active position

The knight on e4 seems well-placed and could create threats. Moving it to g3 would attack White's king on e2, which could be a strong move.

Taking the rook seems like the best move here, as it removes an immediate threat and gains material advantage.

You are a professional chess player and you play as black. Now is your turn to make a move. Before making a move you can pick one of the following actions:
- 'get_current_board' to get the schema and current status of the board
- 'get_legal_moves' to get a UCI formatted list of available moves
- 'make_move <UCI formatted move>' when you are ready to complete your turn (e.g., 'make_move e2e4')

Player_Black (to Proxy):

After analyzing the position, I can see that:

1. White's rook is on f6, attacking my e6 pawn
2. White's king is on g3, far from my king
3. I have several options including king moves, rook moves, and pawn advances

One of my most pressing concerns is the attacked e6 pawn. I should also consider improving my position and potentially creating counterplay.

Looking at the legal moves, I think the most principled move is to defend the e6 pawn by moving my king to e7, which also activates my king.

1. My king is on e7 with White's rook on f6 nearby
2. I have a bishop on c8 and rooks on a8 and h8
3. White's king is on g6, quite exposed

The most pressing issue is that White's rook on f6 is putting pressure on my position. I need to address this threat while improving my position.

Among my options:
- Moving my king to safety (e7d8, e7d7, e7f6, e7d6)
- Developing my rooks (h8g8, h8f8, etc.)
- Moving my bishop (c8d7)

I'll move my king to d8, getting away from the pressure of White's rook on f6 while maintaining control of the center.

- I'm playing as Black
- White has a rook on e6 that's attacking my pawn on e7
- White's king is on g3
- My king is on e8
- I have rooks on a8 and h8, and a bishop on c8
- There's a white pawn on d4 that has been promoted
- The position looks quite complex

Let me check what legal moves I have available.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Now I can see my legal moves. Let me analyze the position more carefully:

I notice that my king on e8 is in check from White's rook on e6. This is a critical situation that I need to address immediately. My legal moves reflect this - I must either move my king, block the check, or capture the attacking piece.

Looking at my options:
- I can move my king with e8d7 (but I don't see this in the legal moves list, which is strange)
- I can block with my rook: h8e8
- I can capture the rook with a piece (but I don't see a piece that can capture it)

From the legal moves provided, h8e8 seems to be my best option - moving my rook to block the check. This protects my king while positioning my rook on an active central file.

- My king is on e8
- I have rooks on a8 and e8
- I have a bishop on c8
- I have pawns on a7, b7, d4 (captured white pawn), g7, and h6
- White has a rook on c6, a king on g6, and pawns on a6, d7, and g6

Let me check what legal moves I have available.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Now I can see my legal moves. Let me analyze the position and make the best move:

The position is quite unusual. I notice several key factors:
- I have a discovered check opportunity with my bishop on c8 if I move my rook from e8
- White's rook on c6 is threatening my b7 pawn
- My king is in the center and could benefit from castling

Among my options, I see that I can castle kingside with e8g8, which would improve my king safety. This is typically a strong move when available.

I'll make this move:

Looking at the position, I see I'm playing as Black and the situation is quite complex. I notice:

2. White has a rook on d6 which is attacking my d-pawn
3. I have a rook on a8 and g8, and a bishop on c8
4. The position appears to be in the middlegame/endgame phase

Let me analyze my best options:

- I could move my king to e7 with d8e7, but that would put me in check from the rook on d6
- Moving my bishop with c8d7 develops a piece and protects the d-pawn
- Moving my rook on g8 to e8 (g8e8) would connect my rooks
- Advancing my b-pawn with b7b5 could gain space on the queenside

After consideration, I'll develop my bishop to protect my d-pawn and improve my piece coordination:

- Moving my king to c8 (d8c8) would protect the bishop and improve my king's position
- This would also connect my rooks, which is generally good

Based on this analysis, I'll move my king to c8:

You are a professional chess player and you play as black. Now is your turn to make a move. Before making a move you can pick one of the following actions:
- 'get_current_board' to get the schema and current status of the board
- 'get_legal_moves' to get a UCI formatted list of available moves
- 'make_move <UCI formatted move>' when you are ready to complete your turn (e.g., 'make_move e2e4')

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Let me analyze the position:

I'm playing as Black and I see I have a rook on a8 and g8, my king on c8, a bishop on a4, and pawns on a7, b7, and h6. White has a rook on d6, pawns on a6 and g6, and the white king is on f5.

My bishop on a4 is attacking along the a4-e8 diagonal and has several good moves available. I notice I can play a4-e8, which would put my bishop on the back rank and create a strong threat.

I'll make this move:

make_move a4e8

I need to analyze this position carefully. I'm playing as Black, and I notice:

1. Material is roughly equal (I have a bishop, two rooks, and some pawns vs White's rook and pawns)
2. White's rook is on e5, threatening my position
3. My king is on e8, and I need to ensure its safety
4. I have a bishop on c8 that could be developed

Looking at my legal moves, I should prioritize king safety and piece coordination. The move e8d7 looks good as it:
- Moves my king to a safer square
- Begins to centralize my king
- Avoids any immediate threats
- Prepares to connect my rooks later

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Looking at the position, I see that I'm playing as Black and I have several options. The position appears to be in the endgame with limited material. White has a rook on f6 and the king on f3, while I have my king on c8, a bishop on d7, and rooks on a8 and g8.

I notice that White's rook on f6 is attacking my g-pawn, so I should consider defending it. I also see that my bishop on d7 has several good diagonal moves available.

One strong move would be to activate my rook with:

make_move g8e8

This centralizes my rook, increases my control of the e-file, and maintains flexibility. It also keeps my king protected and allows me to coordinate my pieces better for counterplay.

I need to analyze this position carefully as Black.

Looking at the board:
- I'm in check from the White rook on d4 attacking my king on e8
- I need to address this check immediately
- My options are to move the king, block the check, or capture the attacking piece

Since I can't capture the rook or block the check, I must move my king. The safest option appears to be castling kingside, which would move my king to safety and bring my rook into play.

4. White has pawns on a3 and g3

Looking at the position, I notice my bishop on d7 has several diagonal moves available. I should consider if there are any tactical opportunities or if I need to improve my position.

Since White's rook on d4 is active in the center, I could consider attacking it with my bishop. The move d7b5 would put pressure on the rook while developing my bishop to a more active square.

- My king is on c8 with rooks on a8 and g8
- I have a bishop on b5 that's quite active
- Material seems roughly equal

Looking at my options, I see several strong possibilities:

1. Bishop moves: My bishop on b5 has many options, including the powerful b5e8 which would pin White's rook against my king
2. King moves: I could move my king to safety
3. Rook moves: I could reposition my rooks for better coordination

The move b5e8 stands out as particularly strong - it pins White's rook on e5 against my king. This would force White to either move the king or defend the rook, giving me a tactical advantage.

Now I have a clear picture of the position and my legal moves. Let me analyze the situation:

1. My king is on c8 and can move to d8, b8, d7, or c7
2. I have a rook on g8 that can move to h8 or f8
3. I have a bishop on e8 that can move to various squares (f7, d7, g6, c6, b5, a4)
4. I have a rook on a8 that can move to b8
5. My b7 pawn can move to b6, b5, or capture on a6
6. My h6 pawn can move to h5

The most concerning piece is White's rook on e4, which is currently not directly threatening any of my pieces. I should consider developing my pieces and improving my position.

Moving my bishop to develop it seems good. The bishop on e8 is currently blocked by my own pawn structure. Moving it to g6 would develop it to a good diagonal.

I need to analyze this position carefully. 

I see that I'm playing as Black and the position is quite simplified. White has a king on g1 and a rook on e1. I have my king on c8, a bishop on g6, rooks on a8 and g8, and pawns on a7, b7, h6, and a captured white pawn on a3.

Looking at the legal moves, I notice that White's rook on e1 is undefended. My bishop on g6 can capture it with the move g6e4, which would win a rook for free. This is clearly the strongest move in the position.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

I can see the current position and my legal moves. Let me analyze the situation:

I'm playing as Black and have a bishop on e4 that's very active, controlling many squares. I notice my king is on c8 and I have rooks on a8 and g8. White has a king on f2 and a rook on e5.

Looking at the position, my bishop on e4 is threatening White's rook on e5. This is an immediate material gain opportunity. The bishop can capture the rook without any apparent threats.

I'll make this move:

make_move e4e5

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Proxy (to Player_Black):

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

I apologize for the error. Let me double-check the board and the legal moves again. It seems I misinterpreted the position.

Looking at the legal moves list and the board again, I see that my bishop is on e4, and there appears to be a white rook on e5. However, my move e4e5 was rejected as illegal.

Let me look more carefully at the board representation:
- White pieces are uppercase (♔, ♖)
- Black pieces are lowercase (♚, ♜, ♝)

I see now that the white rook is actually on e2, not e5. The e5 square is empty.

One of the strongest moves available is to capture the white rook with my bishop:

make_move e4e2

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Proxy (to Player_Black):

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

I apologize for the confusion. Let me carefully re-examine the board and the legal moves list.

Looking at the board again:
- My black king is on c8
- I have rooks on a8 and g8
- I have a bishop on e4
- White has a king on f2 and a rook on e2

From the legal moves list, I see that one of the options for my bishop is "e4f3". This would put the bishop in a position to attack the white king, creating a check.

Let me make this move:

make_move e4f3

Looking at my legal moves, I notice I have a bishop on f3 with many possible moves. This bishop appears to be attacking White's position, and I should consider how to maximize its potential.

The move f3g2 looks particularly strong as it would put my bishop right next to the white king, creating a powerful check. This would force the white king to move and give me the initiative.

White has a rook on e3 and the white king is on g1. I need to make a strong move that improves my position.

The bishop on g6 is well-placed, controlling important diagonals. My king on c8 could use some protection. I also notice I could potentially create threats with my rooks.

I'll move my king to d8, which improves my king's position, connects my rooks, and prepares to centralize my king in the endgame.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

I need to analyze this position carefully. 

I see that I'm playing as Black and the position is quite simplified. White has a rook on e4 and the king on g1. I have my king on d8, rooks on a8 and h8, a bishop on g6, and pawns on a7, b7, h6, and h7.

White's rook on e4 is currently not attacking anything directly, but it controls the e-file. My bishop on g6 is well-positioned, controlling the long diagonal.

Looking at my options, I notice I can improve my king's position by moving it toward the center with:

The most pressing issue is that White's rook on e5 is attacking my position. I need to consider my options:

1. I could move my bishop to protect against potential threats
2. I could improve my king position
3. I could coordinate my rooks

The bishop on g6 is well placed on the long diagonal. Moving my king to d7 seems reasonable to centralize it and stay connected with my pieces.

1. I could capture White's pawn with b7xa6, but that doesn't seem urgent
2. I could move my king, but it seems safe where it is
3. I could move my bishop on g6 to various squares
4. I could move either rook along the back rank

The most active move appears to be connecting my rooks, which would improve my position and prepare for potential counterplay down the h-file.

I can see the current position. This is an interesting endgame position where I'm playing as Black. I notice:

- My king is on d8 with a white rook on e8 (I'm in check)
- I have a bishop on g7, rooks on a8 and g8, and pawns on a7, b7, g7, and h6
- White has a king on g1, a rook on e8, and a pawn on a6

Since I'm in check, I need to address that immediately. Let me check my legal moves.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

I see my legal moves to get out of check. I need to move my king from d8 to one of these squares: c8, d6, c6, e7, or back to d8.

Let me evaluate these options:
- d7d8: Moving back to d8 would keep me in the same file as the white rook
- d7c8: Moving to c8 gets me away from the rook's attack
- d7e7: Moving to e7 would put me next to the white rook, which is dangerous
- d7d6: Moving to d6 gets me away from the rook's attack
- d7c6: Moving to c6 gets me away from the rook's attack and gives me more space

The safest move appears to be either c8, d6, or c6. Among these, c6 seems best as it gives my king more space and activity in the center.

- White has a rook on f6 that's threatening my g-pawn
- White's king is on g1

Looking at my legal moves, I need to address the immediate threat to my g7 pawn while maintaining a good position. I could:

1. Move my bishop to defend the pawn with g6f7
2. Move my king to safety and development
3. Move one of my rooks to a better position

The bishop move to f7 seems most logical as it defends my pawn and maintains my piece activity.

I should focus on:

2. Preparing to advance my pawns for promotion
3. Keeping my king active

- Controls more central squares
- Creates a potential passed pawn

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Thank you for providing the legal moves. Let me analyze the position and make a strategic decision.

Looking at the position, I notice:
- I have a material advantage with two rooks and a bishop versus just a pawn
- My king is active in the center on c6
- I should aim to coordinate my pieces to checkmate the white king on g1

Among my options:
- I could advance my g-pawn with g7g5 to open lines
- I could improve my bishop's position
- I could centralize my rooks to prepare for an attack

The most effective approach would be to centralize one of my rooks to prepare for a checkmate. Moving my a8 rook to the center would be powerful.

I'll analyze the position as Black:

I have a material advantage with two rooks and a bishop against White's lone king. White's king is on g1, and my king is on c6. I have several strong options:

1. I could move my rook to create an immediate checkmate threat
2. I could advance my king to restrict White's king further
3. I could coordinate my pieces for a forced mate

Looking at the position, I see an immediate checkmate opportunity by moving my rook to d1, which would deliver checkmate since White's king on g1 has no escape squares.

Looking at my options:
- My rook can move along the 8th rank
- My bishop on f7 has several diagonal moves
- My king has multiple moves
- I have pawn advances available

The most active piece is my rook on g8. Since there's no immediate threat or tactical opportunity, I'll improve my rook's position by centralizing it.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

I'll analyze the position and make a strategic move as Black.

White has played a4, which is an unusual first move. It doesn't immediately fight for the center, which gives me an opportunity to establish a strong central presence.

The most principled response would be to take control of the center with either e5 or d5. Playing e5 is a classic response that stakes a claim in the center and opens lines for the bishop and queen.

I can see the current board position. I'm playing as Black, and it appears White has played a4 and h4 while I've developed my knight to f6 and pushed my e-pawn to e5. Let me check what legal moves I have available.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Now I can see all my legal moves. Let me analyze the position and make a strategic decision:

1. Development is key in the opening, and I notice my knight on f6 is already developed.
2. I should continue developing my pieces, particularly getting my other knight out and working toward castling.
3. The move b8c6 (developing my queenside knight) looks very natural and follows opening principles.

This move develops my queenside knight to a good square, controls the center squares d4 and e5, and progresses my development. It's a standard opening move that will help me prepare for castling later.

I can see the current board position. It appears White has played an unusual opening with pawns at a4 and h4, and c3. As Black, I've developed my knights to c6 and f6, and have a pawn on e5. Let me check what legal moves I have available.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Now I have a clear picture of the position and my available moves. 

Looking at the position, I should focus on developing my pieces and controlling the center. I notice I can develop my dark-squared bishop to e7, which would be a solid move that protects my king and prepares for castling.

Another good option would be to play d7-d5, staking a claim in the center and potentially challenging White's control there.

After considering my options, I'll develop my bishop to e7, which is a natural developing move in this position.

I see the position now. I'm playing as Black and have several interesting options. 

Looking at the board, I notice:
- I have the opportunity to castle kingside (e8g8)
- My king is still in the center
- White has advanced a pawn to a4 and h4
- I have knights developed to c6 and f6, and a bishop on e7

Given the position, castling kingside would be a strong move to improve my king's safety and connect my rooks. This is typically a priority in the opening/early middlegame.

I can see all my legal moves now. Let me analyze the position:

1. I'm playing as Black and the position appears to be in the early middlegame
2. My king has castled kingside (g8)
3. I have a bishop on e7 and knights on c6 and f6
4. I have a pawn on e5 that could be advanced
5. White has a pawn on a4 that could be a target

After evaluating the position, I think developing my pieces further and controlling the center would be beneficial. The move e5-e4 looks strong as it:
- Advances a central pawn
- Gains space
- Puts pressure on White's position
- Supports my knight on f6

I'll make this move:

I notice that:

- I have a bishop on e7 that could develop
- I have knights on c6 and f6
- White has a pawn on a4 that could be vulnerable
- White has a knight on f3

One strong move would be to develop my bishop to c5, putting pressure on the center and the f2 square.

I'll analyze the position and make a strategic move as Black.

Looking at the board, I notice:
- My king is on h8 with a rook on f8
- I have two knights (c6 and f6) and two bishops (c5 and e4)
- White has advanced a pawn to a4, which could be a target
- My e4 pawn is advanced and could be developed further

Among my options, I see a few strong candidates:
- Castling with either "h8g8" or "f8g8" would improve king safety
- Knight moves like "f6g4" could increase pressure on White's position
- Bishop moves like "c5d4" could target White's center

I think the best move is to castle kingside, which will connect my rooks and improve my king's safety.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

I'll analyze the position and make a strong move as Black.

Looking at the board:
- I have two knights (c6 and f6) and two bishops (c5 and c8) developed
- My king is on g8 without castling
- White has knights on e5 and f3, and has developed some pieces

I notice my bishop on c5 is attacking the d4 pawn, and my knight on f6 could potentially move to e4, which would be a strong central square.

After evaluating the options, I'll play knight to e4, which puts pressure on the center, attacks the c3 pawn, and places my knight on an excellent central outpost.

After analyzing the position and my available moves, I notice several important factors:

1. My king is currently on g8 and needs safety
2. I have a knight on e4 that's well-positioned and potentially threatening
3. I have a bishop on c5 that's active
4. White has a knight on f3 that could be targeted

One strong move stands out: I can play my knight from e4 to f2, which is a fork attacking White's king on e1 and rook on h1 simultaneously. This is a powerful tactic that will win material.

- I have a knight on h1 that appears to be in an unusual position
- There's some pressure on the queenside

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Thank you for providing the legal moves. Let me analyze the position and make a decision.

Looking at the position and available moves, I notice several important factors:

1. My knight on h1 is oddly placed but can move to g3 or f2
2. My bishop on c5 has several good diagonal options
3. My queen on d8 has mobility
4. White's queen on a4 could be threatening my queenside

After evaluating the options, I'll develop my bishop on c5 to e7, which accomplishes several things:
- Develops the bishop to a good square
- Protects the king
- Maintains control of the diagonal
- Prepares for potential castling

- White has an active queen on a3 and a bishop on f4
- My king is on g8 with some pawn cover
- I have a knight on f1 that's deep in White's territory, which could be a strong piece
- I have a bishop on e7 that has good diagonals

Among my options, developing the knight on f1 to g3 looks particularly strong - it attacks White's queen on a3 and creates a fork with the e2 pawn. This would be a very tactical move that could win material.

After analyzing the position, I can see I'm playing as Black and need to make a move. 

I notice several key aspects of the position:
- My king is on g8 with rooks on a8 and h8
- I have knights on c6 and g3, with the g3 knight actively placed
- White has a queen on a3 and a bishop on f4
- My bishop on e7 is developed and has several potential moves

Looking at my options, I see a strong tactical opportunity with my knight on g3, which is attacking White's rook on h1. This is a fork situation since the knight also threatens White's queen on a3 if it moves to e2.

After analyzing the position, I see several interesting options as Black. 

I notice I have two knights - one on c6 and another on e2 which is very active and threatening. My king is on g8 with potential to castle queenside. White has a queen on a3 and a rook on e5 that seem to be applying some pressure.

One of the strongest moves appears to be the knight on e2, which is forking White's king on e1 and rook on g1. This is a tactical opportunity I should capitalize on.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

I need to analyze the position carefully before making my move.

Looking at the board, I notice:
- White has a queen on c3 and a rook on e5
- My king is on g8 with limited development
- White has a bishop on f4 threatening my e7 bishop
- I have a knight on g1 that's actively placed in White's territory

The most pressing issue is my king's safety. I see that my king is somewhat exposed with the queen and rook threatening potential attacks. Developing my pieces and improving king safety should be priorities.

Among my legal moves, I'll choose to move my king to f8, which improves my king's position and connects my rooks:

1. My king is on h8 with the rook on f8, so I can castle kingside
2. I have a knight on g1 that's actively placed in White's territory
3. I have a bishop on e7 that has several good diagonal options

Given the position, I think castling kingside is a strong move. It will connect my rooks and improve my king's safety.

2. White has a queen on c2 and rooks on c1 and e5
3. My king is on g8 with potential pressure along the e-file

Looking at my options, I should prioritize:
- Developing my pieces
- Ensuring king safety
- Potentially capitalizing on the advanced knight on g1

The knight on g1 is in an unusual but potentially powerful position. I can use it to create threats by moving it to e2, f3, or h3.

I'll move the knight to e2, which checks the White king and forces a response.

2. White has a rook on e5 that's attacking my e-pawn
3. White has a bishop on f4 that's attacking my c7 pawn
4. My king is on g8 with castling rights still available

Looking at my options, I notice my knight on e2 is well-placed, forking White's queen on c3 and rook on c1. However, I need to be careful about potential threats.

One strong move would be to develop my rook with f8e8, putting pressure on the e-file where White has a rook. This would improve my piece coordination and prepare for potential counterplay.

I can see the current board position. Let me analyze it:

As Black, I notice:
- I have a knight on e2 that's attacking White's queen on c3
- My king is on g8 with a rook on e8
- White has a rook on e5 that's attacking my e-pawn
- There appears to be some tactical possibilities

Let me check what legal moves I have available.

After analyzing the position and the legal moves, I see a clear tactic. My knight on e2 is attacking White's queen on c3. I can capture the queen with my knight.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

After analyzing the position, I see several key factors:

1. I have two knights (c3 and c6) that could make active moves
2. My king is on g8 with potential castling options
3. My dark-squared bishop on e7 has several possible moves

Looking at the position strategically, I notice White has a rook on e5 that's quite active, and I should consider addressing this threat. My knight on c3 is particularly well-placed and can make several strong moves.

The move Ne4 (c3e4) looks particularly strong as it:
- Attacks the white rook on e5
- Establishes my knight in a central position
- Creates pressure in White's position

I'll make this move:

After analyzing the position, I see several key factors:

1. My king is exposed on g8 with White's pieces (queen, rook, bishop) potentially targeting that area
2. I have a knight on e4 that's well-positioned and attacking several squares
3. White has a rook on e5 that's quite active

One of my strongest moves appears to be the knight on e4 capturing the bishop on f2, which would be a fork attacking White's king and rook simultaneously.

Looking at the position, I need to make a strategic decision as Black. I notice several key aspects:

1. My king is on g8 with limited development
2. White has an active position with the queen on c2 and rooks on c1 and e5
3. I have a knight on f2 that's deep in White's position - this is a strong piece
4. My other knight on c6 has several good options

The knight on f2 is particularly interesting as it's attacking White's rook on e5. I should consider either capturing that rook or using the knight to create other threats.

I'll capture the rook on e5 with my knight:

I can see the current board position. Let me analyze it:

As Black, I notice:
- White has a strong attack with the queen on c2 and bishops on f4
- My king is on g8 and appears to be somewhat exposed
- I have knights on c6 and e4, with the e4 knight being quite advanced
- My bishops are on c8 and e5

Before deciding on my move, let me check what legal moves I have available.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Thank you for providing the legal moves. After analyzing the position and available moves, I'll make my decision.

The knight on e4 is quite active and potentially threatening, but it could also be vulnerable. The knight on c6 has several options as well. I need to consider both development and safety.

Looking at the position, I notice my bishop on e5 is undefended and could be captured. My knight on e4 is also in an advanced position that could be useful for an attack or might need protection.

I think one of the strongest moves here is to develop my bishop from c8, which is currently undeveloped. This would improve my piece coordination and prepare for castling queenside if needed.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

After analyzing the position and my legal moves, I notice several key factors:

1. My king is in the center (e8) and could potentially be vulnerable
2. White has a bishop on f4 and a rook on c3 that are active
3. I have a knight on h1 that's out of play and needs to be developed
4. My knight on c6 is well-positioned and could be used for development

Given these considerations, I'll castle kingside to improve my king's safety:

I see the position now. I'm playing as Black and have several interesting options. 

Looking at the board, I notice:
- I have the option to castle kingside (e8g8)
- My knight on h1 is oddly placed but can move to g3 or f2
- I have two bishops developed (c8 and f6)
- White has a rook on c3 and queen on h2

The safest and most developing move here is to castle kingside, which will protect my king and connect my rooks.

After analyzing the position, I can see that I'm playing as Black and my king is on g8. White has a strong attack with the queen on h7 and a bishop on g5. I need to address the immediate threats.

Looking at my legal moves, I notice I can protect my king by moving it to f8 or e8, or by moving a piece to block potential checks. 

The most natural move here is to castle queenside by moving my king to e8:

2. My knight on h1 is oddly placed and needs to be developed
3. White has a rook on c3 and queen on e5, creating some pressure

Castling kingside would be a good move to improve my king's safety and connect my rooks. This is typically a priority in the middlegame.

After analyzing the position, I see several interesting options:

1. I have a knight on e4 that's very active and could make several strong moves
2. My other knight on c6 also has mobility
3. I need to be careful about my king's safety as it appears to be in the center (g8)

The knight on e4 is particularly strong and has several good options. One of the most attractive moves is e4f2, which would fork White's king on f3 and queen on e2. This would win material as White cannot defend both pieces.

1. White has a queen on e8 (♕), which is a very advanced position
2. Black's king is on h8 (♚)
3. There appears to be a complex tactical situation

Let me check what legal moves I have available.

After analyzing the position and legal moves, I can see this is a critical situation. White's queen on e8 is threatening my position, and I need to respond carefully.

The most pressing issue is the white queen on e8 which is threatening my king. I have the option to capture it with my bishop (d8e8) or rook (g8e8). Taking with the bishop would be a mistake as it would leave my king exposed. Taking with the rook is the better option.

After analyzing the position and available moves, I notice several key elements:

1. I have castling available (e8g8) which would improve my king safety
2. My knight on f2 is active and threatening White's position
3. I have two bishops developed and my queen is on d8

Castling kingside is a strong move here as it brings my king to safety and connects my rooks. This is typically a priority in the middlegame when it's still available.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

I'll analyze the position:

1. My king is on g8 with the rook on h8, so castling is not an option.
2. White has a bishop on d4 and rooks on c1 and g1.
3. I have knights on c6 and f2, with the latter being very active on White's side of the board.
4. My bishop on f6 is well-placed on an open diagonal.

The knight on f2 is particularly interesting - it's deep in White's territory and could be a strong attacking piece or potentially vulnerable. Let me consider my best options:

1. The knight on f2 could capture a piece or check the king with moves like f2d1, f2h1, or f2d3
2. I could develop my queen with d8e7
3. I could improve my king's position with g8f8

Looking at the position more carefully, I notice White's king is on f3, and my knight on f2 can deliver a fork by moving to h1, attacking both the king and rook.

- White has a bishop on d3 and rooks on f1 and g1

After analyzing the position and my legal moves, I see several interesting options:

1. I have a knight on d4 that could capture White's bishop on d3 (d4xd3)
2. I could move my king to safety with Kf8 or Ke8
3. I have tactical opportunities with my bishop on f6

The most immediate and strong move I see is to capture White's bishop with my knight:

Player_Black (to Proxy):

I apologize for the confusion. It seems I misinterpreted the board position. Let me check the legal moves again and make a valid move.

Looking at the legal moves list, I notice that "d4d3" isn't actually listed, which means I misunderstood the position. Let me look more carefully at the board and the legal moves.

From the legal moves list, I see that I have a knight on d3 (not d4 as I initially thought), and I can move it to various squares. Given White's exposed king on g3, one of the strongest moves would be to check the king with my knight:

You are a professional chess player and you play as black. Now is your turn to make a move. Before making a move you can pick one of the following actions:
- 'get_current_board' to get the schema and current status of the board
- 'get_legal_moves' to get a UCI formatted list of available moves
- 'make_move <UCI formatted move>' when you are ready to complete your turn (e.g., 'make_move e2e4')

Player_Black (to Proxy):

After analyzing the position, I see several good options as Black. 

I notice my knight on f2 is attacking White's rook on f1, but it's defended by the king on f4. I also see that my knight on c6 has good central control options.

One of the strongest moves here would be to develop my knight from f2 to e4, which attacks the white king on f4 and creates a powerful fork between the king and the rook on f1. This is a decisive tactical opportunity.

After analyzing the position, I notice several important features:

1. White's king is exposed on f4
2. I have a knight on e4 that can deliver a check
3. There's a potential fork opportunity

The move that stands out is using my knight on e4 to check the White king while also attacking another piece. Let me play:

make_move e4f2

This knight move:
- Delivers check to the White king on f4
- Simultaneously attacks White's rook on f1
- Creates a knight fork, a powerful tactical motif

This should force White to move their king, after which I can capture the rook on f1, winning material.

The knight on f2 is particularly strong, putting pressure on White's position. I'll use it to attack White's rook on e1 while simultaneously threatening a fork on the king and rook.

3. There's a potential tactical opportunity with my knight on c6

Looking at the legal moves, I see that my knight on c6 can move to d4, which would attack White's king directly. This is a check and a very strong move that puts immediate pressure on White.

After analyzing the position and my legal moves, I see several promising options. The most striking opportunity is that my knight on d4 can attack White's exposed king with a check.

The move Nd4-f3+ looks very strong as it:
1. Checks the king
2. Attacks White's rook on f1
3. Creates a potential fork situation

This move forces White to respond to the check and could lead to material gain.

- Knight f6 to d4 would check the king
- Knight f6 to e5 would check the king

One of the strongest moves appears to be the knight fork with e5c4, which would attack White's bishop on f6 and potentially another piece. However, I need to be careful about king safety.

You are a professional chess player and you play as black. Now is your turn to make a move. Before making a move you can pick one of the following actions:
- 'get_current_board' to get the schema and current status of the board
- 'get_legal_moves' to get a UCI formatted list of available moves
- 'make_move <UCI formatted move>' when you are ready to complete your turn (e.g., 'make_move e2e4')

Player_Black (to Proxy):

I can see that I have three legal moves:
1. h8g7 - Moving my rook from h8 to g7
2. g8g7 - Moving my king from g8 to g7
3. f6g7 - Moving my bishop from f6 to g7

Looking at the position, I notice that White's king is on f4 and appears to be somewhat exposed. My king on g8 is currently safe. I have a bishop on f6 that's actively placed, and moving it would give up that diagonal control.

The most natural move here is to improve my king's position by moving it to g7, which also protects the g7 square and gives my king more space.

After analyzing the position, I can see that I'm playing as Black and there are several interesting tactical opportunities.

I notice that White's king is on f4, which is quite exposed. I have two knights (on c4 and d1) and two bishops (on c8 and f6) that could potentially create threats.

One of the strongest moves appears to be moving my knight from c4 to e3+, which would give check and fork the White king and rook on f6. This would allow me to win material after the king moves.

One of the strongest moves I see is the knight move e3f5+, which gives check to the White king and attacks the rook on g7 simultaneously. This fork would win material.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

I need to analyze this position carefully. 

I notice that White's king is on f4, and I have several pieces that could potentially create threats. My knights are on f6 and d1, bishops on f5 and c8, and I have rooks on a8 and g7.

Looking at potential tactical opportunities, I see that my knight on f6 can attack the white king by moving to either g8 or e4. The bishop on f5 also has some interesting diagonals.

One particularly strong move appears to be moving my knight from f6 to e4, which would create a check and potentially fork the king with another piece. However, I don't see Ne4 in the legal moves list, so that's not available.

Another strong option is to move my rook from g7 to g6, which threatens the white king on f4 and creates pressure along the g-file.

After evaluating the options, I'll make this move:

1. I have a rook on f6 that's very active and can make several moves
2. My bishop on e5 is well-positioned and threatening several squares
3. I can move my queen from d8

Looking at the position more carefully, I notice that White's king is exposed on e4. My bishop on e5 is already putting pressure on the king, and I have a tactical opportunity here.

The move e5d4 (bishop from e5 to d4) creates a powerful discovered check from my rook on f6 against White's king, while also attacking with the bishop. This is a very strong tactical shot.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Looking at the position, I notice several key factors:

1. White's king is exposed on e4
2. I have two bishops (c8 and d4) and a rook on f6 that could potentially attack the king
3. My queen on d8 is currently not active

The most powerful move I see is to use my bishop on d4 to check the king:

make_move d4e5

This move checks the white king and forces a response. It's a strong attacking move that puts immediate pressure on White's position and restricts the king's mobility. The bishop on e5 will control important squares and potentially set up further tactical opportunities.

3. My rook on f6 is already in an active position

I notice a particularly strong move: I can attack White's king with my bishop from e5 to g3, creating a check. This would force the king to move and give me a strong initiative.

1. I have a rook on f6 that's active and can move in multiple directions
2. I have two bishops - one on g3 threatening diagonals and one on c8
3. My king is on h8 with potential to move to g7 or g8

The white king is exposed on e5, which presents tactical opportunities. My bishop on g3 is particularly well-positioned, controlling important diagonals.

I'll make a strong move with my bishop on g3, attacking the white king with a check:

1. I have a strong attack with my rook on f4 controlling the 4th rank

3. I have a bishop on d6 that could be developed better

Looking at the legal moves, I notice I can directly attack the white king with my rook. This seems like the strongest continuation.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

After analyzing the position, I see that I'm playing as Black and have several options. The White king is exposed on d4, and I have both bishops and the queen available for an attack.

One of the strongest moves I see is to use my dark-squared bishop to attack the White king with a check:

After analyzing the position, I see several interesting options:

1. I notice my king is on h8 and I have a rook on a8, so castling is not an option.
2. White's king is exposed on d4, which presents tactical opportunities.
3. I have two bishops - one on c8 and one on e5, with the e5 bishop attacking White's king.
4. White has a rook on d3 that could be threatening.

The bishop on e5 is my most active piece and gives me tactical chances against White's exposed king. I'll use it to create a threat.

3. My queen on d8 has several possible moves

The most powerful move I see is to capture the white rook on d3 with my bishop, which would be a significant material gain and puts pressure on White.

I can see the current position. Let me analyze what's happening:

1. White's king is on d4 and appears to be quite exposed
2. Black has both bishops (c8 and e8), a queen (d8), and a rook (a8)
3. There's an unusual pawn structure with a white pawn on b7
4. White has rooks on d3 and b1

Let me check what legal moves I have available as Black.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Thank you for providing the legal moves. Let me analyze the position and find the best move.

I notice several promising options:

1. My queen has many potential moves, including the powerful Qh4+ which would check the exposed white king
2. I have bishop moves that could develop pressure
3. The rook on a8 can move to b8 to attack the white pawn on b7

After analyzing the position, I see that Qh4+ (d8h4) is a very strong move. It puts White's king in check, and after the king moves, I'll have good follow-up options. This check forces White to respond and gives me the initiative.

After analyzing the position and my legal moves, I can see several important factors:

1. I'm playing as Black and have a material advantage with a queen, rook, bishop, and pawns against White's rook, knight, and some pawns
2. White's king is exposed on d4
3. My queen on e7 has many potential moves
4. My bishop on f4 is well-positioned and attacking diagonally

I see an opportunity for a strong move with my queen. I can attack White's king directly with:

make_move e7e4

This move:
- Directly attacks the White king, putting it in check
- Controls important central squares
- Maintains protection of my other pieces
- Forces White to respond to the check, limiting their options

Player_Black (to Proxy):

After analyzing the position, I see that I have a very strong position as Black. I have my queen on e4 and bishop on f4, both actively placed with many potential threats.

Looking at the board, I notice White's king is exposed on c3 with limited protection. My queen on e4 is already putting pressure on that area. I can create a decisive advantage by moving my queen to c4, directly attacking the white king with check.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

After analyzing the position, I can see I'm playing as Black and have several good options. 

I notice I have a bishop on f4 that's attacking the white king on c1, but it's not a check because the white rook on c1 blocks the line. I also have my king on h8 with a rook on a8.

One of my strongest moves would be to move my bishop to capture the pawn on h2 with check, which would force White to respond to the check and potentially give me a material advantage.

4. White's king is on c3, somewhat exposed

My best move appears to be to use my bishop to attack White's rook on d6. This creates a direct threat and gains material.

The position shows I have my king on h8, a rook on a8, a bishop on d6, and several pawns. White has a king on c3, rooks on c1 and e5, a knight on c7, and some pawns.

My bishop on d6 is very active with multiple diagonal moves available. I notice that my king is in the corner with the white knight on c7 potentially setting up threats.

One of the strongest moves here appears to be moving my bishop to g3, which attacks White's king on c3 directly. This would create a powerful check that forces White to respond.

2. The white knight on e6 is threatening my position.
3. My king on g8 is somewhat exposed.

Looking at my options, I see that I can move my bishop to e5, which would attack White's rook on e5 while maintaining control of important squares. This seems like a strong move.

4. White's king is on c3 with a rook on e5 and g7

Among my legal moves, I see some strong options:

The bishop on e5 has many potential moves, but the most impactful would be to capture the knight on e5 with Bxe5. However, I don't see that as a legal move, so the knight must be elsewhere (perhaps I misread the board).

One of my strongest moves would be to activate my rook on a8. Moving it to the center with Ra8e8 would increase my control of the e-file where White has a rook.

I can see the current position. I'm playing as Black and I notice:
- My king is on g8
- I have a rook on f8
- I have a bishop on e4
- I have pawns on a7, c7, d7, f7, and h7
- White has a king on c3, rooks on c3 and g2, a knight on e5, and pawns on b4 and c6

Let me check my legal moves to make the best decision.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Thank you for the list of legal moves. Let me analyze the position and make the best move.

I notice several important aspects:
1. The white knight on e5 is attacking several squares and is a threat
2. My bishop on e4 is currently undefended but attacking the white king's position
3. I have several king moves available and pawn advances

Looking at my options, I see that I can capture the white knight on e5 with my bishop: e4×e5. However, this move isn't listed in the legal moves, which means either the bishop is pinned or I misinterpreted the position.

One of my strongest moves appears to be advancing the d-pawn to d5, which would strengthen my center control and potentially create threats.

I'll make this move:

I notice several important aspects of the position:
1. I can capture White's rook on g2 with my rook (g8g2)
2. I have bishop checks available with my bishop on e4
3. My knight on e5 has several possible moves

The most immediate opportunity is capturing the undefended rook on g2, which would be a significant material gain. This is clearly the strongest move in the position.

2. My bishop on e5 has many available moves
3. My rook on g2 is active and controls the g-file
4. My king on h8 can move to g7

The most critical decision is how to deal with White's knight on e6, which is threatening my position. I can capture it with my bishop.

2. White has a knight on e5 threatening my bishop on g7
3. White has a rook on c3 and king on b3
4. I have a rook on g2 that's currently active

The most critical issue is my bishop on g7 being under attack by the knight on e5. I need to address this threat immediately.

Looking at my options, I can:
1. Move the bishop away (several options available)
2. Defend the bishop with a pawn (f7-f6)
3. Counter-attack with my rook

The best move appears to be to move my bishop to safety while maintaining its activity. Moving to f6 seems strong as it maintains diagonal control and gets out of danger.

4. Material is roughly equal, but I have an active rook on g2

Looking at my options, I notice my rook on g2 is very active and can potentially deliver a check or threaten White's king on a4. This is a powerful piece that should be used effectively.

The move g2a2 stands out as particularly strong - it delivers check to the White king while being safe from capture. This forces the White king to move and gives me the initiative.

3. My bishop on f6 has several possible moves

The knight on e6 is a major threat that forks my king and pawn on c7. I need to address this immediately. I can either capture it with my f7 pawn (but don't see that in the legal moves, suggesting it's not possible), move my king, or protect the c7 pawn.

Looking at the legal moves, I see that I can move my bishop to e7, which would defend the c7 pawn against the knight's attack. This is a strong defensive move that maintains my bishop's activity.

1. I could attack White's king with my rook by playing `a2b2+`
2. I could move my bishop to create threats
3. I could advance my d-pawn

The most forcing and clearly advantageous move is to check the White king with my rook, which will force the king to move and potentially lead to material gain or even checkmate.

You are a professional chess player and you play as black. Now is your turn to make a move. Before making a move you can pick one of the following actions:
- 'get_current_board' to get the schema and current status of the board
- 'get_legal_moves' to get a UCI formatted list of available moves
- 'make_move <UCI formatted move>' when you are ready to complete your turn (e.g., 'make_move e2e4')

I see the current position. Let me analyze what's happening:

1. I'm playing as Black and have a rook on b2, a bishop on e6, and my king on g8
2. White has a king on b4, a rook on e3, and some pawns
3. The material is roughly equal, but I need to see what legal moves I have to make the best decision

Let me check my legal moves:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Thank you for the list of legal moves. Now I can make an informed decision.

Looking at the position and my available moves, I notice several important factors:
- My rook on b2 can capture White's pawn on b4, which would also put White's king in check
- This is a strong move as it wins material and forces the king to move

The move b2b4 (capturing the pawn and giving check) is clearly the best option here, as it gains material and puts immediate pressure on the opponent.

After analyzing the position, I see that I'm playing as Black with several key pieces: a king on h8, a bishop on e7, a rook on b4, and several pawns. White has a king on a4 and a rook on e5.

I notice my rook on b4 is very active and can potentially deliver a strong check. Since the white king is on a4, I can play:

make_move b4a4

This captures the white king, which would be checkmate. If this is somehow not a legal move (which would be unusual in a standard chess position), please let me know and I'll reconsider my options.

Let me analyze the position:

I'm playing as Black and I see I have:
- My king on h8
- A bishop on e7
- A rook on a4
- Pawns on a7, d5, e5, f7, and h7

White has:
- King on b3
- Rook on e5
- Pawn on c3

Looking at the legal moves, I need to consider my best option. The white rook on e5 is attacking my d5 pawn. I should either defend it or create counterplay.

One of my strongest moves would be to use my rook on a4 to attack along the 4th rank, potentially creating threats against the white king.

I'll play my rook to e4, attacking White's rook on e5 while also creating pressure along the 4th rank.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

I need to analyze this position carefully. 

I see that I'm playing as Black with my king on h8, a bishop on e7, and pawns on a7, d5, e5, f7, and h7. White has a king on b4 and a rook on e5.

The most critical aspect of this position is that White's rook on e5 is attacking my pawn on e5. I need to address this threat immediately.

Looking at my options:
1. I could move the bishop to protect the e5 pawn (e7f6 would work)
2. I could capture the rook with my pawn (d5e4)
3. I could move my king to safety (h8g8 or h8g7)

The best move here is to capture the undefended rook with my pawn:

Player_Black (to Proxy):

I need to analyze this position carefully. I'm playing as Black and have several options.

Key observations:
- My king is on h8 with the White king on a6
- I have a bishop on e7 and pawns on a7, c7, e4, f7, and h7
- White has a pawn on c6

Looking at the position, I notice my bishop on e7 is very active and can control important diagonals. The e4 pawn is advanced and could be a potential passed pawn.

The best move here appears to be advancing my e-pawn to increase its potential as a passed pawn and to gain space. This will help me in creating a potential queen in the endgame.

I see my legal moves now. This is an interesting endgame position where I (Black) have a significant material advantage with a bishop and several pawns versus White's lone pawn.

I notice my e-pawn on e2 is ready to promote. This is clearly the strongest move available as it will give me a new queen. Promoting to a queen is almost always the best choice unless there's a specific tactical reason for underpromotion.

After analyzing the position and my legal moves, I see I have several strong options. I have my king on h8, a bishop on e7, a queen on e1, and pawns on c7, f7, and h7.

The most powerful piece I have is my queen on e1, which has many possible moves. Since I'm in an endgame position with few pieces left, I should use my queen actively.

One of the strongest moves would be to attack the white pawn on c6 with my queen, which would put pressure on White's position.

The most powerful piece I have is my queen, and I should use it effectively. Since the White king is on c7, I can consider checking it with my queen.

I'll move my queen to c6, which puts the White king in check and controls important squares:

The most direct approach is to use my queen to deliver checkmate. I see that I can play Qc8#, which would be an immediate checkmate since the White king on b8 would be attacked by my queen with no escape squares.

- Black pawns on f7 and h7
- White king on c8

Let me check what legal moves I have as Black.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Now I can see my legal moves. Let me analyze the position:

This is a simplified endgame where I (Black) have a bishop and two pawns against just the White king. My goal should be to promote one of my pawns safely.

Looking at the position:
- My king on h8 is safe
- My bishop on e7 controls important diagonals
- I have pawns on f7 and h7 that can potentially advance

The best plan is to advance my pawns toward promotion while keeping them protected. Since the White king is on c8, it's quite far from my pawns.

I'll advance my f-pawn which helps control more space and starts the promotion process:

You are a professional chess player and you play as black. Now is your turn to make a move. Before making a move you can pick one of the following actions:
- 'get_current_board' to get the schema and current status of the board
- 'get_legal_moves' to get a UCI formatted list of available moves
- 'make_move <UCI formatted move>' when you are ready to complete your turn (e.g., 'make_move e2e4')

I see the position now. I'm playing as Black and I have a king on g8, a bishop on e7, and pawns on h7 and f5. White has a king on d7. Let me check what legal moves I have available.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Now I understand my available moves. Let me analyze the position:

I have my king on h8, a bishop on e7, and pawns on h7 and f5. White's king is on d7.

Key considerations:
1. My bishop on e7 is currently undefended
2. I should keep advancing my pawns when possible
3. I need to ensure my king is safe

Looking at the legal moves, I think the best move is to advance my h-pawn, creating more space and potentially creating a passed pawn for promotion later. This is a common strategy in endgames.

Now I can see all my legal moves. Let me analyze the position:

White has played c2-c4 and e2-e3, setting up for a potential Queen's Gambit or English Opening structure. I've already played e7-e5, creating a central presence.

Among my options, developing my knights and bishops would be most principled at this stage. The move Nf6 (g8-f6) is particularly strong as it:
1. Develops a piece
2. Controls the center (particularly the e4 square)
3. Prepares for kingside castling
4. Is a standard developing move in open positions

This is a classic developing move that follows opening principles - control the center, develop pieces, and prepare for castling.

I need to analyze the position carefully before making my move.

I notice that:
- White has developed their queen early to c2
- White has a bishop on e5 and pawn on e5
- I have knights on f6 and d4, with the d4 knight being particularly active
- My king is still in the center

Looking at the position, I see several good candidate moves:

1. Developing with `f8e7` (Be7) would be solid
2. `d4e6` (Nd4-e6) would put pressure on White's position
3. `d4c2` (Nd4xc2) would win the queen, but I need to check if it's a trap

After careful consideration, I believe capturing the queen is best as long as it's not a trap. The knight on d4 can safely capture the queen on c2, and I don't see an immediate refutation.

- White has developed the light-squared bishop to e5
- White has played c4, controlling the d5 square
- White's king is castled kingside
- My knight on f6 is developed, but I need to continue development

Among my options, I should prioritize development and control of the center. The move Bf8-e7 looks particularly good as it:
1. Develops my bishop
2. Protects my knight on f6
3. Prepares for kingside castling
4. Maintains flexibility in my pawn structure

I see the position now. I'm playing as Black and have several interesting options. 

Looking at the board, I notice:
- I have the option to castle kingside (e8g8)
- My knight on c2 is deep in White's territory and could make several moves
- My bishop on e7 has good diagonal control
- My knight on f6 is well-positioned

The most principled move here is to castle kingside, which will bring my king to safety and connect my rooks. This is a priority in the middlegame.

I'll analyze the position and make a strategic move as Black.

Looking at the board, I notice:
- Both sides have castled kingside
- White has a bishop on e5 and a pawn on c4
- I have a knight on f6 and another knight on c2 that has infiltrated White's position
- My e5 pawn is advanced

The knight on c2 is a strong piece that's causing disruption in White's position. I should consider either:
1. Capturing material with it
2. Moving it to a better square to increase pressure

I see that my knight on c2 can capture White's bishop on e1 with Nc2e1, which would win a bishop for free.

I need to analyze the position carefully before making my move.

Looking at the board, I notice:
- I'm playing as Black
- White has developed their bishop to e2
- White has a knight on e1 (which appears to have just moved there)
- I have a knight on f6 and a bishop on e7
- My king is still on g8 and I haven't castled yet

Given the position, I should prioritize development and king safety. Castling kingside would be a good move here to secure my king. I also see I have a knight on e1 that could be developed.

I'll castle kingside:

1. I notice my knight on e1 is attacking White's bishop on d3, which seems like a good capture opportunity.
2. I also have a knight on f6 that could develop further.
3. My king's position seems somewhat exposed with the rook on f8 not connected to the rook on a8.

After evaluating the options, capturing the bishop with my knight seems to be the strongest move, as it wins material.

One of the best moves appears to be 1...Nd3-f4, which puts pressure on White's kingside and attacks the pawn on f3. This knight will be well-placed on f4, controlling important central squares and creating tactical threats.

You are a professional chess player and you play as black. Now is your turn to make a move. Before making a move you can pick one of the following actions:
- 'get_current_board' to get the schema and current status of the board
- 'get_legal_moves' to get a UCI formatted list of available moves
- 'make_move <UCI formatted move>' when you are ready to complete your turn (e.g., 'make_move e2e4')

Player_Black (to Proxy):

After analyzing the position and my available moves, I notice several key factors:

1. I have a knight on e2 that's actively placed in White's territory
2. My bishop on e7 has good diagonal control
3. My knight on f6 is well-positioned in a classic development square
4. I should continue developing my pieces and improve my king's safety

One of the best moves here is to castle kingside, which will secure my king and connect my rooks:

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Looking at the position, I need to make a strategic decision as Black. I notice several key elements:

1. White has knights on a6 and g5, putting pressure on my position
2. I have a knight on e2 that's deep in White's territory
3. My king is on g8 with some potential safety concerns

One strong move I see is to develop my rook to e8, connecting my rooks and controlling the e-file. This is a natural developing move that improves my position.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

After analyzing the position and my legal moves, I notice several interesting options:

1. I can castle kingside with e8g8 (O-O), which would improve my king's safety
2. I have knight moves like e2f4 that could attack White's position
3. I can develop my pieces with moves like a8b8

Given the position, castling kingside seems most urgent for king safety and rook development.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

After analyzing the position and my available moves, I'll make a decision.

I notice I have two knights - one on f6 and one on e2. The knight on e2 is particularly active and can make several good moves. I also see my dark-squared bishop on e7 and light-squared bishop on c8.

The knight on e2 is particularly well-placed and can attack White's position. I'll move it to c3, which attacks White's rook on a2 and creates a fork threat.
