I don't see (can't guess) which bishop it saw and offered to move 3 times in a row:

I apologize for the confusion. Let me look at the board more carefully and check the notation.

From the board representation:
```
♜ ⭘ ⭘ ♛ ⭘ ♜ ♚ ⭘
♟ ♟ ♟ ⭘ ♝ ♟ ♟ ♟
⭘ ⭘ ⭘ ⭘ ⭘ ♞ ⭘ ⭘
⭘ ⭘ ⭘ ♟ ♞ ⭘ ⭘ ⭘
♙ ⭘ ⭘ ♙ ♝ ♗ ⭘ ⭘
⭘ ⭘ ♙ ⭘ ⭘ ⭘ ⭘ ♙
⭘ ♙ ⭘ ♔ ♙ ⭘ ♙ ⭘
♖ ⭘ ♕ ♘ ⭘ ♗ ♘ ♖
```

I see that I have a bishop on e5 and there's a white bishop on f4. Let me try the capture with the correct UCI notation:

make_move e5f4
