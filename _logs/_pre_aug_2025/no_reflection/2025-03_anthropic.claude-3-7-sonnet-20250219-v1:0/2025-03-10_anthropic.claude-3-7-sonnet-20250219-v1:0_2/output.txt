--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Now I can see all my legal moves. As Black responding to 1.c3, I have several good options:

1. e7e5 - Taking control of the center with a pawn
2. d7d5 - Also controlling the center
3. g8f6 - Developing the knight to a good square

Among these, I'll choose e7e5, which is a solid classical response that stakes a claim in the center. This is a standard approach against White's more restrained opening.

I see my available moves. I notice I have the option to castle kingside with e8g8, which is a strong move in this position. Castling will:

1. Bring my king to safety
2. Connect my rooks
3. Develop my h8 rook to the g-file

This is a natural development move that aligns with good chess principles. Since my kingside is already developed with the knight on f6 and bishop on e7, and there are no immediate threats preventing castling, I'll proceed with this move.

I need to analyze the position carefully before making my move.

Looking at the board, I notice:
- White has developed pieces on the queenside with pawns at b3, c3, d3
- White has pushed e4, creating some central presence
- My king is on g8 with a rook on f8, suggesting I haven't castled yet
- I have a bishop on e7 and knights on c6 and f6
- There's a white bishop on h3 that could be threatening my kingside

Among my options, I should prioritize king safety and piece development. The move e7-d6 looks solid as it develops my bishop to a good diagonal while maintaining protection of my kingside.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

After analyzing the position, I can see I'm playing as Black and need to make a move. 

I notice that:
- White has advanced a pawn to e4
- My king is on g8 with a rook on f8
- I have knights on c6 and f6, bishops on c8 and d6
- The white bishop on h3 is attacking my kingside

Looking at my options, I should focus on development and king safety. One strong move would be to castle kingside, which would connect my rooks and improve my king's safety.

Looking at the board, I notice:
- The position appears to be in the middle game
- White has a bishop on e5 that's quite active
- My king is on g8 with the rook on f8 - I could consider castling kingside (which would be O-O or h8g8 in UCI notation)
- I have knights on c6 and f6 that could be developed further

One strong move would be to castle kingside, which would bring my king to safety and connect my rooks. This is a standard developing move that improves my king's safety.

After analyzing the position, I notice several important factors:

1. White has moved their queen to g4, which is quite aggressive
2. My king is still in the center (on g8)
3. I need to develop my pieces and ensure my king's safety

Among my options, I should prioritize king safety and development. The most natural move here is to castle kingside, which will protect my king and connect my rooks.

I can see the current position. White has developed their queen to f3 and bishop to e3, with pawns advanced at b3, c3, d3, e4, f3, g3, and a2. Black has a standard kingside castled position with knights on c6 and f6, bishops on c8 and e7, and the queen on d8.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Thank you for providing the legal moves. Let me analyze the position and make a good move.

I notice that White has developed their queen early to f3 and has a bishop on e3. My position as Black is solid with castled king and normal development.

Looking at my options:
- I could develop my light-squared bishop with Bc8-d7 or Bc8-b7, but those aren't in the legal move list yet
- I could play a knight move like Nf6-e4, which would attack White's queen
- I could advance pawns to create space or prepare future development

The move Nf6-e4 looks particularly strong as it attacks White's queen on f3 and stakes a claim to a central square. Since White's e4 pawn is protected by the bishop on e3, my knight would be safe there.

Looking at my options, I should prioritize development and king safety. One strong move is to castle queenside by moving my rook from f8 to e8, which connects my rooks and improves my king's position.

One strong move is to castle kingside, which would move my king to safety and connect my rooks:

Castling kingside would be a good strategic choice here as it brings my king to safety and connects my rooks. This is typically a priority in the middlegame.

- White has a bishop on a7 that's deep in Black's territory
- Black's king is on g8 and appears to be missing castling opportunity
- Black has knights on c6 and e4
- White's king is on c2, which is unusual

Let me check what legal moves I have available as Black.

After analyzing the position and my available legal moves, I see several interesting options:

1. My knight on e4 is well-placed and can attack several squares
2. I have a bishop on d6 that has good diagonals
3. My queen on d8 has several potential moves

The most pressing issue is that White's bishop on a7 is threatening my position. I should consider addressing this threat while improving my position.

I'll play the knight move e4f2, which attacks White's king on c2 and the rook on h1 simultaneously, creating a fork. This is a strong tactical move that forces White to respond to the immediate threat to their king.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

I need to analyze this position carefully. I'm playing as Black and I notice:

1. Material is roughly even
2. My king is on g8 without castling rights
3. White's king is exposed on d3
4. I have a bishop on e5 that's actively placed
5. I have a knight on c6 that could potentially attack
6. White has a bishop on a7 that's in my territory

Looking at my options, I see tactical opportunities. The bishop on e5 is particularly strong and could create threats. I also notice my queen can potentially create threats.

I'll play a move that increases my attacking potential against White's exposed king:

You are a professional chess player and you play as black. Now is your turn to make a move. Before making a move you can pick one of the following actions:
- 'get_current_board' to get the schema and current status of the board
- 'get_legal_moves' to get a UCI formatted list of available moves
- 'make_move <UCI formatted move>' when you are ready to complete your turn (e.g., 'make_move e2e4')

I can see the board position now. Let me analyze the situation:

As Black, I notice several interesting features:
- White's king is exposed on d4
- I have a bishop on d4 that's attacking White's king
- White has a bishop on a7 that's threatening something
- My king is on g8 and seems to be in a relatively safe position

Let me check what legal moves I have available.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

After analyzing the position and legal moves, I see a powerful move. I have a bishop on d4 that's directly attacking the White king. This is a check, and I should look for the strongest continuation.

Looking at the legal moves for my bishop on d4, I can see several options. The most powerful appears to be d4c3, which maintains the check while also attacking White's rook on b2. This is a double attack (or fork) on the king and rook.

After analyzing the position, I notice I have a bishop on d2 that's attacking the white king on d4. This is a check situation, and I should capitalize on it.

Looking at my options for the bishop on d2, I can move it to:
- e3 (maintaining the check and potentially setting up a fork)
- c3 (maintaining the check)
- e1 or c1 (retreating but losing the check)
- b4 or a5 (moving diagonally but losing the check)

The move d2e3 looks strongest as it maintains the check while potentially setting up future tactics.

After analyzing the position, I can see I'm playing as Black with a fairly developed position. I notice my king is on g8, and I have a knight on c6 and bishops on c8 and e5. 

Looking at the legal moves, I see several good options. The bishop on e5 is particularly active and has many potential moves. I also notice my queen on d8 has several options.

I'll choose to develop my bishop from c8 to f5, which will improve my piece activity and control of the center.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

I apologize for the error. Let me check the board again more carefully. It seems I misinterpreted the position. Looking at the board, I see that my bishop is already not on c8 but elsewhere. Let me make a better move based on the actual position.

Let me choose a strong move with my bishop on e5, which appears to be well-positioned.

After analyzing the position and my available moves, I notice I have a bishop on f2 that's actively placed deep in White's territory. I also need to consider my king's safety and development of my pieces.

The bishop on f2 is particularly strong and can potentially capture material or create threats. Looking at the options for this bishop (f2a7, f2b6, f2c5, f2h4, f2d4, f2g3, f2e3, f2g1, f2e1), I see several good possibilities.

I'll move my bishop from f2 to e3, which maintains pressure on White's position while controlling important central squares. This move threatens White's knight on d4 and maintains flexibility for my bishop.

After analyzing the position, I can see several key factors:

1. My king is on g8 with the rook on a8 and h8
2. I have a knight on c6 and bishops on c8 and e3
3. White has a bishop on b5 that's currently attacking my c6 knight

Looking at my options, I notice my bishop on e3 is actively placed and can attack White's position. I should also consider developing my pieces and ensuring king safety.

One strong move is to develop my bishop from c8 with tempo by attacking White's bishop on b5:

Player_Black (to Proxy):

I apologize for the error. Let me check the legal moves again and make a valid move.

Looking at the position more carefully, I see that my king is actually on g8 (not castled as I initially thought), and I need to make a legal move from the list provided.

Let me choose a strong move from the legal options. The bishop on e3 is well-placed and can make a strong diagonal move:

After analyzing the position, I see that I'm playing as Black and have several good options. 

I notice my king is on g8, and I have a knight on c6 that could develop to better squares. My queen on e7 is active and has many possible moves. The white bishop on a4 is attacking my queenside, and White has a knight on d4 in a strong central position.

One of the strongest moves here would be to develop my knight to a more active position while putting pressure on White's center. The move Nc6-d4 would be excellent, but it's not available since White already has a knight there.

Instead, I'll play the knight to e5, which controls central squares and puts pressure on White's position.

You are a professional chess player and you play as black. Now is your turn to make a move. Before making a move you can pick one of the following actions:
- 'get_current_board' to get the schema and current status of the board
- 'get_legal_moves' to get a UCI formatted list of available moves
- 'make_move <UCI formatted move>' when you are ready to complete your turn (e.g., 'make_move e2e4')

After analyzing the position and my available moves, I notice I have a knight on e5 that's quite active and a queen on e7. 

I'll play a solid move that improves my position by developing my rook from a8 to b8, which connects my rooks and prepares for potential action on the queenside.

White has a bishop on a4 that could potentially threaten my queenside, and knights on e4 and g1. White's king is on c2, which is somewhat exposed.

Looking at my legal moves, I think developing my rook from b8 to a8 would be a solid move, connecting my rooks and preparing for potential action on the a-file.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

After analyzing the position, I can see that I'm playing as Black and have several options. I notice my king is on g8, and I have a knight on f3 that's actively placed in White's territory.

Looking at the board, I see that White has a knight on e4 that's threatening some squares, and a bishop on b4. My queen is on e7, and I should consider how to best use it.

One strong move would be to develop my knight on f3 further with a move that puts pressure on White's position. The move Nf3-d4 looks particularly good as it:
1. Centralizes my knight
2. Attacks White's pawn on b3 (indirectly)
3. Could potentially threaten White's king on c3 in future moves

I'll make this move:

Looking at my options, I notice my knight on d4 has several strong moves. In particular, the knight fork at e2 looks very powerful as it would attack both White's king on d3 and rook on f1 simultaneously.

After analyzing the position, I can see several key factors:

1. I have a knight on e2 that's actively placed
2. My queen on e7 has multiple potential moves
3. My king on g8 is castled but could be developed

Looking at the board, I notice White has a knight on e4, a bishop on a4, and the white king is on d4. This gives me an opportunity for a tactical move.

The knight on e2 is particularly well-positioned and can deliver a fork. I'll play:

make_move e2c3

This knight move attacks both White's king on d4 and the pawn on b5 simultaneously, creating a fork. Since the king must move, I'll be able to capture the pawn on the next move, gaining material. This is a strong tactical opportunity that I shouldn't miss.

After analyzing the position, I can see several key factors:

1. I have a knight on c3 with multiple attacking options
2. My queen on e7 is active and has many potential moves
3. My king on g8 appears to be safe for now

One of the strongest moves I see is to use my knight to attack White's king on d4. This creates an immediate threat and puts pressure on my opponent.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

After analyzing the position and the available legal moves, I can see that I'm playing as Black with a relatively developed position. 

I notice my knight on d5 is well-placed in the center, but it's potentially under threat from White's knight on e5. I also see my queen on e7 has many available moves.

One strong move would be to develop my bishop on c8 while putting pressure on White's position:

make_move c8g4

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

I apologize for the error. Let me check the legal moves again and make a valid move.

Looking at the list of legal moves, I see that c8g4 isn't available. Let me choose another strong move from the available options.

Since my knight on d5 is well-positioned but potentially under threat from White's knight on e5, I'll consider protecting it or making a strong move with my queen.

Looking at the board, I see White has a king on d3 that appears somewhat exposed. My queen on e5 is already putting pressure on the e-file, and I have an opportunity to increase that pressure.

One of the strongest moves appears to be:

make_move e5e4

This move:
1. Advances my queen to a more aggressive position
2. Puts direct pressure on White's position
3. Threatens the e-file and increases control of the center
4. Creates potential tactical threats against White's king

I notice that my king is on g8 with my rook on a8, and I have a bishop on c8. White has a king on d2, a rook on f1, and a bishop on a4 threatening my position.

One of the strongest moves here is to attack White's king with my queen:

make_move e4d3

This move puts direct pressure on White's king, attacking it from a safe distance. It creates immediate threats while maintaining my queen's mobility. If White's king moves, I can potentially follow up with more attacks or capture material. This is a strong tactical move that forces White to respond to my threat.

1. I'm playing as Black and have a knight on d5 in a strong central position
2. White has a bishop on a4, a knight on f3, and a rook on f1
3. White's king is on c2, which is somewhat exposed
4. My king is on g8 with rooks on a8 and h8

Looking at my options, the knight on d5 is my most active piece. I can use it to create threats or improve its position. The move Nd5-f4 looks particularly strong as it:
- Attacks the h3 square (potential fork spot)
- Controls important central squares
- Puts pressure on White's kingside

I notice my knight on f4 is well-positioned and has several good options. One particularly strong move is to play Nf4-d5, which:
1. Centralizes my knight
2. Attacks White's c-pawn
3. Creates potential threats against White's king position

This is a typical knight maneuver to improve its position and increase pressure on my opponent.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

After analyzing the position, I can see I'm playing as Black with my king on g8. I have a knight on d5 that has several good options, and my rooks are on a8 and h8. White has a bishop on a4, a knight on f3, and the white king is on c2.

The knight on d5 is well-positioned and has many potential moves. One strong option is to move it to f4, which would attack White's pawn on h5 while also putting pressure on the center.

Another good option is to develop my rook from a8 to b8, which would increase my control of the b-file where White already has a rook.

I'll choose to move my knight to f4, which creates threats and maintains my knight in a strong central position.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

I need to analyze this position carefully. 

I see that I'm playing as Black and my king is on g8. White has a bishop on d4 and a knight on f3, with a rook on b1. My knight on f4 is active and could potentially make several moves.

Looking at the position, I notice:
1. My king is somewhat exposed with the white bishop on d4 pointing in that direction
2. My knight on f4 is well-placed and has several options
3. I should consider both defensive needs and potential counterplay

One strong move would be to play Nf4-d5, which:
- Centralizes my knight
- Attacks the c3 square where White's king is
- Creates potential tactical threats

One strong move would be to develop my knight from g4 to e5, which would control central squares and potentially threaten White's position. This knight move puts pressure on the center and could create tactical opportunities.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

After analyzing the position and the available legal moves, I can see I'm playing as Black with a fairly developed position. I have a knight on e5 that's centralized and active, and my king is on e8 with both rooks still on their original squares.

The knight on e5 is particularly strong and has several good options. I notice I can play Nf3, which would attack White's king on c2 with a fork since there's a rook on b2. This would be a powerful tactical shot.

After analyzing the position and legal moves, I can see I'm playing as Black with my king on e8 and rooks on a8 and e8. I have a bishop on d7 and a knight on f3. 

The position looks favorable for me as Black. I notice my knight on f3 is active and can make several strong moves. One particularly good move is to play Nf3-d4, which:

1. Centralizes my knight
2. Attacks the pawn on b5
3. Controls important central squares
4. Could potentially threaten a fork later

Let me make this move:

I'm playing as Black and have a knight on d4 that's quite active in White's territory. I also have a bishop on d7 and my king is on e8 with rooks on e5 and g8.

Looking at the position, I notice my knight on d4 is well-placed and could potentially create threats. One strong move would be to advance it to f3, which would put pressure on White's position and potentially threaten the g1 square (though it's currently empty).

I'll make this move:

I notice I have a bishop on d7, a knight on f3, and my king is on e8 with rooks on e5 and g8. The position appears to be in the middlegame or early endgame.

One of the strongest moves available is to develop my knight on f3 to a more active square. The knight move f3-g5 looks particularly strong as it attacks the h7 pawn and puts pressure on the center.

- I have a knight on g5 that's active
- My king is on e8 with rooks on both sides
- I have a bishop on d7
- Material seems roughly equal

Among my options, I see a few key considerations:
1. King safety - I could castle kingside with e8f8 followed by g8f8
2. Developing my bishop on d7
3. Advancing pawns to control more space

I think the most important priority is king safety, so I'll castle kingside.

- Moves my knight to a central square
- Creates a threat in White's territory
- Develops my piece to a more active position

I can see that I'm playing as Black and I'm in a position where my king (on g8) is under threat. I have only two legal moves:

1. h8g7 - Moving my rook from h8 to g7
2. g8g7 - Moving my king from g8 to g7

Looking at the board position:
- I have my king on g8 with a rook on h8 and another rook on f8
- White has a pawn on g7 that's threatening my position
- I have a knight on e4 that could be valuable

The best move here is to move my king to safety. Moving the rook would leave my king vulnerable, while moving the king protects it and also maintains control of my pieces.

After analyzing the position and my legal moves, I notice I have a knight on e4 that's well-positioned in the center. I also have a bishop on d7 and two rooks that could be better coordinated.

Looking at the position, I'll improve my king's safety by moving my king away from the h-file to g8, which also connects my rooks.

After analyzing the position, I can see I'm playing as Black with a material advantage. I have a rook pair, bishop, knight, and several pawns against White's rook and king.

I notice my knight on e4 is well-positioned and can make several strong moves. One particularly good move is to play e4f6, developing the knight to a strong central square that controls important squares and can't be easily attacked.

This knight move to f6 is a classic development move that:
1. Controls the center
2. Protects the g8-h7 diagonal (helping defend the king)
3. Creates threats against White's position
4. Improves my piece coordination

After analyzing the position, I see I'm playing as Black with a material advantage. I have two rooks, a bishop, a knight, and several pawns, while White has a rook, a knight, and a few pawns.

Looking at the legal moves, I notice a few key opportunities:
- I can develop my bishop with d7e6 or d7c6
- I can improve my knight position with f6e4 or f6d5
- I can advance my pawns to create more space

The most active move appears to be developing my knight to e4 (f6e4), which puts pressure on the center and potentially threatens White's pawns. This knight on e4 would be well-placed and difficult to dislodge.

I notice I have a knight on e4 that's quite active, and I can develop my bishop on d7. Looking at the position, I see that my king is on g8 with a rook on f8, and I have another rook on g7. White's king is on e1 with a rook on a1.

One strong move would be to develop my bishop with a threat. The move Bd7-f5 looks particularly good as it develops with tempo, controls important central squares, and puts pressure on White's position.

- My knight on e4 is centralized and has good options
- I have two rooks that can be better coordinated

One particularly strong move is to bring my knight to f2, which would fork White's king on e1 and rook on b2. This would win material.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

After analyzing the position, I can see I'm playing as Black with a material advantage. I have a rook, bishop, and knight against White's knight. 

Looking at the legal moves, I notice my bishop on f5 has several good options, and my knight on e4 is well-positioned. I should consider moves that increase my control of the position and potentially target White's king on f1.

One particularly strong move is to use my knight to create a fork. If I play e4f2, my knight would attack both White's king on f1 and potentially another piece, creating a powerful tactical threat.

I need to analyze this position carefully. I'm playing as Black and have several options.

Key observations:
- I have a bishop on f5, a knight on f2, and rooks on f8 and g7
- White has a king on f6 and a knight on g4
- Material seems roughly equal, but I need to find the best move

Looking at my options, I notice my knight on f2 has several strong moves. In particular, the knight can check the White king with Nf2-d3+ or Nf2-h3+. 

The move Nd3+ looks particularly strong as it's a discovered check from my bishop on f5. This would force the White king to move and then I could potentially capture material.

I'll make this move:

Player_Black (to Proxy):

I need to analyze this position carefully. I'm playing as Black and have several pieces in play: king on g8, rooks on f8 and g7, bishop on f5, knight on d3, and several pawns.

Looking at the position:
1. My king is on g8 with a rook on f8 - I should be careful about king safety
2. I have a bishop on f5 that has several good diagonal moves
3. My knight on d3 is active in White's territory
4. White has a king on g2 and a knight on g4

The knight on d3 is particularly strong and could potentially deliver a check or fork. Let me examine if there are any tactical opportunities.

The move d3f2 looks very promising as it would fork White's king on g2 and potentially another piece. This would give me a strong tactical advantage.

Looking at the board, I see I have a knight on d1, a bishop on f5, and rooks on f8 and g7. White has a knight on g4 and the king on g2. Material seems roughly equal, but I need to make a strong move.

The knight on d1 is oddly placed but has some good potential moves. The bishop on f5 is active and controls important diagonals. My king on g8 is relatively safe.

Among my options:
- The knight on d1 can move to several squares, with Nd1-f2 looking particularly strong as it would attack White's king
- The bishop on f5 has multiple diagonal moves
- I could also consider rook moves to increase pressure

The move Nd1-f2+ stands out as it gives check to White's king and creates a strong tactical threat.

3. White's king is on g7 and appears to be somewhat exposed
4. I have rooks on f8 and g7

One of the strongest moves I see is the knight fork with f2g4, which would simultaneously attack White's king and knight on g7. This is a decisive tactical opportunity.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

I'll analyze the position carefully before making my move.

I see that I'm playing as Black and have a material advantage with two rooks, a bishop, and a knight against White's lone knight and pawn. My king is on g8, and I need to consider both attacking opportunities and king safety.

Looking at the legal moves, I notice several strong options:
- I could play g4f2+, giving a knight check to White's king on g2
- I could advance my knight with g4e3 to control more central squares
- I could improve my rook position with f8e8 or f8d8

The knight check with g4f2+ seems most forcing and gives an immediate tactical advantage, as White will have to move their king and then I can continue my attack.

I need to analyze this position carefully as Black.

Looking at the board:
- I have my king on g8 with a rook on f8 and another on g7
- My bishop is on g6, and I have a knight on f2
- White has a knight on a8 and their king on g1

The position appears to be in the endgame phase. My knight on f2 is very active and potentially threatening White's king. I should consider either improving my piece positions or creating direct threats.

One strong move would be to use my knight to attack White's king with:
- f2h3+ which would give check and potentially lead to a strong attack

This knight move creates an immediate check and puts pressure on White's king position while maintaining my knight's activity.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

I see the position now. As Black, I have a material advantage with two rooks, a bishop, and several pawns against White's lone knight and king. Let's analyze the key aspects:

1. My king is on g8 with a rook on f8 (castled position)
2. I have a bishop on g6 that's actively placed
3. White's king is exposed on h6
4. I have pawns on b7, c7, f7, and h7

Looking at my legal moves, I should focus on either:
- Improving my piece coordination
- Advancing toward checkmate
- Protecting against any potential threats

The move Rf8-e8 looks strong as it centralizes my rook while maintaining protection of the f7 pawn. This gives me more control of the e-file and improves my piece coordination.

I have several strong options here:

1. The rook on h5 has an open h-file and can move to various squares
2. My bishop on g6 has a long diagonal
3. I can move my king to safety

The most powerful move appears to be to use my rook on h5 to attack down the h-file toward White's king. Since White's king is on g1, I can create a strong attack by moving my rook to h1, which would be checkmate since the White king has no escape squares.

4. White's king is on g5, somewhat exposed
5. White has a knight on c7 that's threatening pieces

The most powerful move I see is to use my rook on h1 to deliver check:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

I need to analyze this position carefully as Black.

Looking at the board:
- I'm playing as Black with my king on g8
- I have rooks on g1 and f7
- I have a bishop on g6
- I have pawns on b7, f7, and h7
- White has a king on h6, a knight on c7, and a pawn on b6

The most striking feature is that I have a rook on g1 controlling the g-file, and White's king is on h6. This suggests a potential checkmate opportunity.

I'll make the move:

make_move g1h1

This moves my rook to h1, delivering checkmate to White's king on h6. The king cannot move to g5, g6, or h5 as these squares are controlled by my bishop on g6. It cannot move to h7 as that's occupied by my pawn. This is a decisive checkmate.

I have several strong options here. My rook on g1 is already active on an open file, and my bishop on g6 has good diagonals. 

One of my best moves is to attack White's king with my bishop:

make_move g6e4

This move attacks White's king on f5 while maintaining control of important diagonals. It puts immediate pressure on White and forces a response to the check.

I can see the board position now. I'm playing as Black and I have a king on g8, pawns on b7, f7, and h7, and two rooks on e5 and g7. White has a king on d4, a knight on a6, and a pawn on b6.

Let me check what legal moves I have available.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Now I can see all my legal moves. Let me analyze the position:

I notice there's an error in the move list - it shows e6 moves, but my rook is actually on e5 according to the board. I'll work with what I can see on the board.

Looking at the position:
1. I have a material advantage with two rooks and three pawns vs White's knight and pawn
2. White's king is exposed in the center on d4
3. My rook on e5 is attacking along the e-file and could potentially check the king

The strongest move appears to be using my rook on e5 to attack White's king. I can deliver a check with:

make_move e5e4

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

I see the issue now. The board visualization showed a rook on e5, but the legal moves list shows moves for a rook on e6. Based on the legal moves list, I have a rook on e6, not e5.

In that case, I'll use my rook on e6 to check the white king:

After analyzing the position, I can see I'm playing as Black with my king on g8, rooks on g7 and e4, and pawns on b7, f7, and h7. White has a king on c3, a knight on a6, and pawns on b6.

I notice my rook on e4 is active and can control the e-file. My other rook on g7 is protecting the king but could be more active. I should look for the strongest move in this position.

The most promising options appear to be:
1. Using my e4 rook to attack - particularly e4e8 to control the back rank
2. Moving my king to safety with g8h8 or g8f8
3. Advancing the rook on g7 to create threats

I believe the strongest move is to use my rook to control the 8th rank, which will give me attacking chances while maintaining piece activity.

I notice I can deliver checkmate immediately with my rook on e8. By moving the rook to e3, I can deliver a checkmate since White's king on c3 will have no escape squares and my rook will be attacking it directly.

1. I'm playing as Black with my king on g8
2. I have rooks on g7 and e3
3. White's king is on d4 with a knight on b8
4. There are several pawns on the board

Looking at my options, I notice I have a powerful rook on e3 that can deliver a check. Since the White king is on d4, I can play:

make_move e3e4

This move checks the White king and forces an immediate response. The king will likely have to move to c4, d5, or c5, after which I can continue to apply pressure. This is a strong move that restricts the White king's mobility while maintaining control of the e-file.

I notice I have a very strong position with my rook on e4 controlling the 4th rank while my other rook on g7 protects my king. I have several promising options:

1. I could deliver check with my rook: e4d4 - but White's king would simply capture my rook.
2. I could play e4e1, threatening to promote a queen later, but this seems slow.
3. I could play g7g2, threatening to capture on b2 next move.

The most decisive move appears to be to use my rook on e4 to deliver mate. Looking at the position, I can see that if I move my rook to e8, White's king is trapped on the d-file with no escape squares.

I'll play:

This move directly attacks White's king on d4, putting it in check. The king will be forced to move, and I'll maintain pressure with my rooks. This is a very strong attacking move that limits White's options significantly.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

I'll analyze the position as Black:

I have two rooks (on g7 and e4) and my king on g8, while White has a king on d4 and a knight on c3. The position looks advantageous for me.

Looking at my options:
1. My rook on e4 controls the 4th rank and e-file
2. My rook on g7 is protecting the king and controlling the g-file
3. I have several pawn moves available

The most powerful move appears to be using my rook on e4 to check White's king. I can either move it to d4 (capturing the king directly, which isn't legal in chess) or use it to control key squares.

Since the e4 rook has the most mobility, I'll use it to attack. Moving it to e1 would control the back rank and prepare for a potential checkmate.

Now I can see the board position. Let me check what legal moves I have as Black.

g8h8,g8f8,e1e7

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

I can see that I have three legal moves as Black:
1. g8h8 (King moving from g8 to h8)
2. g8f8 (King moving from g8 to f8)
3. e1e7 (Rook moving from e1 to e7)

Let me analyze the position:
- I have a king on g8 and rooks on g7 and e1
- White has a king on d4, a knight on e6, and pawns on b2 and b7
- White's knight on e6 is threatening my king's position

The most powerful move here is e1e7, which puts my rook on the 7th rank where it can potentially deliver check or threaten White's knight. This move also maintains control of the e-file and creates more active play.

I can see the position now. This is an endgame position where I'm playing as Black with a king on g8, two rooks on e7 and g7, and pawns on b7, f7, and h7. White has a king on d6 and a pawn on b6.

Let me check what legal moves I have available.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Now I can see my legal moves. Let me analyze the position:

I have a significant material advantage with two rooks and three pawns versus White's lone pawn. The white king is on d6, which is quite active, but I should be able to win this position easily.

Looking at my options:
1. I should keep my rooks active
2. I could advance my pawns toward promotion
3. I need to keep my king safe

One of the strongest moves here would be to use my rook on the e-file to control the 6th rank and restrict the white king's movement while preparing to advance my pawns.

Now I can see all my legal moves. Since White has played d4, I'll respond with a solid opening move that controls the center.

I'll play the move e7-e6, which is a common response to d4. This opens up development for my bishop and queen while controlling the d5 square. It leads to positions like the French Defense or Queen's Gambit Declined structures.

Thank you for providing the legal moves. Now I can make an informed decision.

Looking at the position, I should continue with my development. I notice that my dark-squared bishop can be developed, and I can also consider advancing my central pawns to challenge White's center.

One of the standard developing moves in this position would be to develop my light-squared bishop to e7, which would protect my king and prepare for castling. This is a solid choice that improves my position.

- White has developed some pieces and has the queen on d4
- I have both knights developed and my dark-squared bishop on e7
- Castling would be a priority to secure my king

Player_Black (to Proxy):

After analyzing the position and my legal moves, I notice I'm playing as Black in what appears to be a position after some opening moves. White has just played d3-d4, and I have several options.

Looking at the position, I should continue my development. I have knights on c6 and f6, bishops on c8 and e7, and my king is still on g8. I haven't castled yet, and that would be a good priority.

Among my options, castling kingside (O-O) would be a standard developing move, but I see my king is already on g8, so I must have already castled kingside. In that case, connecting my rooks by moving my f8 rook to e8 makes sense.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

I'll analyze the position as Black:

The position appears to be in the early opening phase. White has developed the queen to d4, which is somewhat unusual this early. I notice my king is castled kingside, but I'm missing a bishop (likely on c8), suggesting I've already made some developing moves.

Looking at my options:
- I should continue development
- I need to be careful about White's queen on d4, which is attacking my c6 knight
- Developing with tempo by attacking the queen could be advantageous

Among my legal moves, I see that my knight on f6 can move to e4, which would attack White's queen while developing to a strong central square. This is a very strong move that forces White's queen to retreat while improving my position.

I see my knight on e4 is well-positioned and can make several good moves. One strong option is to play e4f2+, which would fork White's king and rook, forcing the king to move and allowing me to capture the rook next move.

I need to address the threat from White's queen on h6. Looking at the position, I see that White's queen is threatening my king's position, and I should prioritize safety.

The move g7h6 would capture White's queen, which is an excellent opportunity. This would eliminate the immediate threat and give me a significant material advantage.

The position appears to be in the middle game with an open g-file. White has a rook on f3 that could potentially create threats along the f-file. I notice my king is on g8 without much pawn cover, and I have two bishops and two knights developed.

Looking at my options:
- I could castle by hand with g8f8 or g8h8
- I could develop my a8 rook
- I have several knight moves available
- I could advance pawns to gain space

One strong move would be to castle by hand by moving my king to the h8 square, which would improve my king's safety and connect my rooks.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

After analyzing the position, I see several interesting options:

1. I can castle kingside with e8g8 (O-O)
2. I have knight moves like c6e5 that could attack White's rook on f7
3. I can develop my pieces with moves like a8b8

The most pressing issue is that White's rook is on f7, which is quite deep in my territory. This is a serious threat that needs to be addressed. The knight on c6 can capture this rook with c6e5 followed by e5f7.

Given the current position, I'll castle kingside to improve my king's safety while also connecting my rooks.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

I need to analyze this position carefully. 

I notice White has a rook on f6, which is attacking my f-pawn. My king is on g8, and I see that White has some pressure on the kingside. I should prioritize king safety and development.

Looking at the legal moves, I see several good options:
- I could move my king to f8 with g8f8, getting out of the file with White's rook
- I could develop with e7f6, challenging White's rook
- I could play g8g7 to get my king to safety

After consideration, I think the best move is to challenge White's rook with my bishop.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Looking at the position, I need to make a strategic decision as Black. I notice several key aspects:

1. My king is on g8 and appears to be safe
2. I have a knight on c6 and f6 that could be developed further
3. White has a bishop on d4 that's quite active

Among my options, I see some strong developing moves. The knight on f6 has several good squares, and I could also push central pawns to challenge White's position.

After analyzing the position, I'll make a move that improves my position by developing the knight on f6 to e4, which would put pressure on the center and potentially threaten White's pieces.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

I apologize for the error. Let me check the legal moves again and make a valid move.

Looking at the legal moves list, I see that f6e4 is not a legal move. Let me select a better option from the available legal moves.

I'll develop my knight from f6 to e4, which would be a strong central square, but that's not available. Instead, I'll play a solid developing move with my knight on f6.

One strong move is to develop my bishop on f6 to a more active square with:

1. Places my bishop on an active diagonal
2. Puts pressure on White's center and queenside
3. Maintains flexibility in my position

4. White has some pieces developed, including bishops on d4 and f2

Looking at my strongest options:
- The bishop on g5 has good diagonals and could be used to increase pressure
- I should consider improving my king safety
- The knight on c6 could be repositioned to a more active square

After evaluating the position, I'll make a move with my bishop on g5 to f6, which improves my kingside defense and maintains control of important central squares.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Now I have a clear picture of the position and my legal moves. Let me analyze the situation:

I notice my king is on g8, and I have several pieces developed. Looking at the position, I see that my knight on c6 has some good options, and developing my pieces further would be beneficial.

One strong move would be to develop my bishop on f6 to g7, which would strengthen my kingside position and control the long diagonal. This is a classic fianchetto position that provides good king safety.

I'll make this move:

make_move f6g7

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

I'll analyze the position as Black:

The position appears to be in the middle game with some pieces already exchanged. I notice my king is on g8 without castling, and I have a bishop pair (g7 and c8). White has a knight on f4 that could be threatening, and there's some pressure on the queenside.

Looking at my options:
- I could develop my queen to a more active square
- I could improve my knight on c6
- I could advance pawns to gain space
- I could move my king to a safer square

The knight on c6 has some good outposts available, particularly e5 which looks strong. Moving to e5 would put pressure on White's position and control important central squares.

I'll make this move:

make_move c6e5

Thank you for providing the legal moves. Let me analyze the position:

I notice I'm playing as Black and my king is on g8. The position appears to be in the middle game with several pieces developed. I see my knight on e5 is quite active and has multiple options.

Looking at the available moves, I should consider:
- The knight on e5 has good outposts at c4, g4, or f3
- My queen on d8 could be developed
- My king's safety might need attention

After evaluating the options, I believe developing my knight to a strong outpost would be beneficial. The move e5c4 looks particularly strong as it attacks the white pawn on b2 while positioning my knight on a good square.

1. My king is on g8 and appears to be safe
2. I have a knight on c4 that's actively placed in White's territory
3. I have a bishop on g7 that controls the long diagonal
4. White has some piece activity with knights on f4 and f7

Looking at my best options:
- The knight on c4 has several good moves, particularly c4e3 which attacks White's f-pawn
- I could develop my queen with moves like d8e7
- I could consider kingside castling with g8f8

After careful consideration, I'll move my knight to e3, which attacks White's f-pawn and improves my piece activity.

- My bishop on g7 is active and can move to several squares
- My queen on d8 has multiple possible moves

Looking at the tactical possibilities, I see that my knight on f5 has some strong options. Moving it to d4 would create a fork threat against White's pieces. This is a strong central square that would increase my piece activity.

One of the strongest moves appears to be developing my knight from d4 to f5, which would attack White's pawn on e3 (though there isn't one there currently) and put pressure on the center. This knight would be well-positioned on f5.

You are a professional chess player and you play as black. Now is your turn to make a move. Before making a move you can pick one of the following actions:
- 'get_current_board' to get the schema and current status of the board
- 'get_legal_moves' to get a UCI formatted list of available moves
- 'make_move <UCI formatted move>' when you are ready to complete your turn (e.g., 'make_move e2e4')

Player_Black (to Proxy):

After analyzing the position, I can see I'm playing as Black and have several good options. The position looks somewhat complex with both kings castled and some piece activity in the center.

I notice my bishop on g7 is well-positioned on the long diagonal, and I have a knight on f5 that's actively placed. I should consider developing my remaining pieces and improving my position.

One strong move is to develop my rook to e8, which puts pressure on the e-file and connects my rooks. This is a standard developing move that improves my position.

Given the exposed position of my king in the center and White's pieces pointing toward the kingside, castling kingside is a priority to secure my king.

1. My king is on g8 and needs safety
2. I have a knight on f5 that's active
3. White has knights on e5 and f3, with a bishop on b2 targeting my kingside

Looking at my options, I'll move my king to safety by moving it to f8, which maintains king safety while clearing the g8 square for potential rook connectivity.

1. I could castle kingside with either h8g8 or f8g8
2. I have knight moves with f5 to various squares
3. I have bishop moves with g7
4. I have pawn advances

Given that my king is still in the center and White has developed pieces, castling would be a priority for safety. The kingside castle looks good as it would connect my rooks and bring my king to safety.

1. h8g8 - Moving my king from h8 to g8
2. f5g7 - Moving my knight from f5 to g7

Looking at the position, I notice that:
- White has a bishop on g7 that's threatening my position
- My king is on h8 and can move to g8
- My knight on f5 can capture White's bishop on g7

The knight move f5g7 is clearly the better option as it captures White's bishop, removing an attacking piece and gaining material. Moving my king to g8 doesn't improve my position and leaves the bishop on g7 unchallenged.

- 'get_legal_moves' to get a UCI formatted list of available moves
- 'make_move <UCI formatted move>' when you are ready to complete your turn (e.g., 'make_move e2e4')

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

After analyzing the position and my available moves, I notice several key factors:

1. I'm playing as Black and my king is on g8
2. White has a knight on f3 and a bishop on g2 pointing at my kingside
3. I should prioritize king safety and piece development

Looking at my legal moves, I'll develop my knight from g7 to e6, which accomplishes several goals:
- Improves my knight's position to a more central square
- Defends the d8 square and supports potential central pawn advances
- Maintains protection of my kingside

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Thank you for providing the legal moves. Let me analyze the position:

I notice that:
- I'm playing as Black and have a knight on e6
- White has a knight on f3 and a bishop on g2
- My king is on g8 with the rook on a8 and h8
- White's king is on f2 with a rook on e1

Looking at my options, I should consider developing my pieces and improving my position. The knight on e6 is well placed and has several good options.

One strong move would be to develop my dark-squared bishop with:

make_move f8g7

This develops my bishop to a strong diagonal, protects my kingside, and prepares for potential kingside castling. The bishop on g7 will exert pressure along the long diagonal and work well with my other pieces.

After analyzing the position, I see I'm playing as Black with my king on g8. I have a queen on g7, a knight on e6, and various pawns. White has a rook on e1, a bishop on g2, a knight on f3, and the king on g1.

I notice my queen on g7 is under attack by White's bishop on g2. This is a critical situation that requires immediate attention. I need to either move the queen or capture the bishop.

Looking at the legal moves, I can see several queen moves (g7g8, g7f8, etc.), but I should prioritize safety while maintaining activity.

The move g7f6 looks strong - it moves my queen to safety while maintaining control of important central squares and keeping pressure on White's position.

I'll analyze the position as Black:

I see I have a knight on e6 and a queen on f6, both actively placed. My king is on g8 with a rook on a8 and a bishop on c8. The position looks somewhat open.

Looking at the legal moves, I have several strong options:
- My queen on f6 has many potential moves
- My knight on e6 can move to various squares
- I can advance pawns or develop my rook

The most active piece is my queen, and I notice I can potentially attack with Qf3, putting pressure on White's position. The knight on e6 is also well-placed and could move to g5 to increase pressure.

After evaluation, I'll make a move with my queen to f3, which applies pressure and maintains my active piece placement:

I see I'm playing as Black and have several interesting options. Looking at the board:

1. My queen on f3 is very active and has many potential moves
2. White has a rook on e1 and the king on g1 with a bishop on h1
3. I have a knight on e5 that could be developed further

The most powerful piece I have is my queen on f3, which is already in a strong attacking position. I notice I can deliver a check with Qf1+, which would force the White king to move.

After careful consideration, I believe the strongest move is to check the White king with my queen:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Now I have a clear picture of the position and my available moves. Let me analyze the situation:

I'm playing as Black and have several pieces: a rook on a8, a bishop on c8, a knight on e6, and my king on g8. The pawn structure is mostly intact, though there are some advanced pawns.

Looking at my legal moves, I should consider:
- Knight moves (e6 to various squares)
- Pawn advances
- King safety
- Piece development

The knight on e6 is well-positioned and has several good options. Moving it to c5 would put pressure on White's d3 pawn, or moving to g5 could increase control of the center.

I'll make a move with my knight to c5, which puts pressure on White's d3 pawn and improves my piece activity.

- I have a rook on a8 and a bishop on c8
- There's an interesting pawn structure with some potential tension

Looking at my options, I should prioritize development and king safety. Moving my king to g7 looks reasonable as it gets out of potential back-rank threats while maintaining safety.

Now I have a clear picture of the position and my available moves. Let me analyze the situation:

I'm playing as Black and my king is on g7. White has a rook on e1 and a bishop on h1, with the white king on g3. The position appears to be somewhat simplified with several pawns and a few pieces remaining.

Looking at my legal moves, I need to consider safety, development, and potential threats. The white rook on e1 is controlling the e-file, and the bishop on h1 is on a diagonal that could potentially target my kingside.

Given the position, I'll play a solid move to improve my king's safety:

make_move g7f8

This move retreats my king to a safer square, away from potential threats along the g-file or diagonal attacks. From f8, my king is well protected and I can continue to coordinate my remaining pieces.

I need to analyze the position carefully before making my move.

Looking at the board:
- I'm playing as Black with my king on f8
- White has a rook on e1 and a bishop on h1
- The pawn structure is complex with several advanced pawns

Key considerations:
- King safety is a priority
- I should develop my pieces and improve my position
- Need to watch for any potential threats

Among my legal moves, I notice I can castle kingside with f8g8, which would improve my king's safety by moving it away from the center and connecting my rooks. This is typically a strong move in the middlegame.

I'll make this move:

3. Control of the center

I notice I can develop my rook by playing Rb8, which would activate this piece and prepare for potential control of the b-file. This seems like a solid developing move.

- The pawn structure is somewhat complex

Among my options:
- King moves (g8h8, g8f8, g8g7) - need to consider safety
- Rook move (b8a8) - doesn't seem to accomplish much
- Pawn advances - could improve my position

I think the most useful move here is to advance my d-pawn two squares, which would stake a claim in the center and potentially open lines for my bishop on c8.

Looking at my options:
- I could develop my bishop with c8e6 or c8f5
- I could advance my d-pawn with d5d4
- I could make a king move for safety

The most active and developing move appears to be moving my bishop to f5, which would put pressure on the center and develop a piece.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

After analyzing the position, I see several key factors:

1. I'm playing as Black and have a material advantage with a rook and bishop vs White's rook and bishop
2. My king is on g8 with some pawn protection
3. I have a bishop on f5 that's actively placed
4. There's a pawn on d5 that could potentially advance

Among my options, I see a strong move with my bishop on f5. Moving it to c8 would protect my rook on b8 while maintaining control of important diagonals.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

I can see all my legal moves now. Let me analyze the position:

I'm playing as Black and have a rook on b8, a bishop on c8, and my king on g8. The position appears to be in the middlegame or early endgame with several pawns for both sides.

Looking at my options:
- I could develop my bishop with moves like c8d7, c8e6, c8f5, or c8g4
- I could advance my d5 pawn with d5e4 (capturing) or d5d4
- I could make a king move, but there's no immediate threat requiring this
- I could make various pawn moves

The most active move appears to be c8e6, developing my bishop to a good diagonal where it controls more squares and contributes to my position. This develops a piece and improves my overall coordination.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

I'll analyze the position and my available moves:

Looking at the board, I'm playing as Black with my king on g8. White has a rook on a1, a bishop on h1, and the white king is on g1. 

Key observations:
- My bishop on e6 is active and can move to several squares
- I have a rook on b8 that could be developed
- My pawn structure is mostly intact

Among my options:
- Moving my king (g8h8, g8f8, g8g7) - generally not urgent unless under threat
- Rook moves along the back rank (b8 to various squares)
- Bishop moves (e6 to c8, d7, f5, or g4)
- Various pawn moves

The bishop on e6 is well placed and can move to f5, which would increase its activity and put pressure on the center. This looks like a strong developing move.

4. There's a pawn structure that needs careful consideration

One of my strongest moves appears to be using my bishop to attack White's position. The move f5c8 (bishop from f5 to c8) looks particularly strong as it maintains control of the long diagonal while potentially preparing for future tactical opportunities.

Looking at the board:
- I'm playing as Black with my king on g8
- White has a rook on c2 and a bishop on h1
- Material seems roughly equal
- I have a bishop on c8 that could be developed
- My d5 pawn is advanced and could potentially be pushed or exchanged

Among my options:
- Developing my bishop with Bc8-f5 or Bc8-e6 looks active
- King safety moves like Kg8-f8 or Kg8-h8 are available
- Advancing my d5 pawn to d4 could gain space

I think developing my bishop to e6 would be a strong move. It activates the piece, controls important central squares, and could help protect my king indirectly.

One of the strongest moves appears to be moving my bishop to g4, which pins White's h-pawn against something on the h-file and increases my bishop's activity.

You are a professional chess player and you play as black. Now is your turn to make a move. Before making a move you can pick one of the following actions:
- 'get_current_board' to get the schema and current status of the board
- 'get_legal_moves' to get a UCI formatted list of available moves
- 'make_move <UCI formatted move>' when you are ready to complete your turn (e.g., 'make_move e2e4')

Player_Black (to Proxy):

After analyzing the position, I can see that I'm playing as Black and have several options. Let me evaluate the key moves:

1. My king is on g8 and can move to h8, f8, or g7
2. My bishop on c8 has several diagonal moves available
3. My rook on b8 can only move to a8
4. I have several pawn moves available

Looking at the position, I notice White has a rook on c3 that's quite active, and White's king is on f1 with a bishop on h1. I should prioritize improving my piece activity and ensuring king safety.

The bishop move c8e6 looks particularly good as it develops the bishop to an active diagonal and controls important central squares.

After analyzing the position, I can see I'm playing as Black with my king on g8, a rook on b8, and a bishop on e6. White has a rook on c5, a bishop on f5, and the king on f1.

I notice my bishop on e6 is attacking White's rook on c5, but it's protected. I also see that my king's position is relatively safe, but I should improve my piece activity.

One of the strongest moves here is to develop my rook to f8, which protects the f7 pawn and puts the rook on a more active file.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

I need to analyze this position carefully as Black.

Looking at the board:
- I have a bishop on e6 and a rook on f8
- My king is on g8
- White has a rook on c3 and a bishop on g7
- Material seems roughly equal

Key considerations:
1. My king safety is important
2. The bishop on e6 is active and could be developed further
3. I should look for any tactical opportunities

Among my legal moves, I see some interesting options:
- Moving my bishop (e6) to better squares
- Improving my king position (g8-h8 or g8-g7)
- Advancing pawns to gain space

The bishop on e6 has good diagonals, and moving it to g4 would increase its activity and put pressure on White's position.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

I can see the current position and my legal moves. Let me analyze the situation:

As Black, I have:
- My king on g8 with the rook on f8 (kingside)
- A bishop on g4 that's actively placed
- Several pawns in their original positions
- White has a rook on c3, a bishop on e5, and the king on f1

Looking at my options, I notice my bishop on g4 has many potential moves. It's currently pinning something or threatening an important square. I also see I can move my f-pawn or develop other pieces.

The most critical decision appears to be whether to:
1. Move my bishop on g4 to a safer square or to increase its activity
2. Advance my f-pawn to f5 to gain space
3. Move my king or rook

Since my bishop on g4 is quite active and potentially pinning a white piece, I'll maintain this pressure while advancing my f-pawn to gain space and support my position.

I'll analyze the position as Black:

I see I have a bishop on e4 that has several good options. I also have my king on g8 and rook on f8. The position looks complex with material appearing roughly equal.

Looking at my bishop on e4, it has many strong diagonal moves available. I notice it can capture on h1, which would be a free rook if there's one there. However, I should check if there are better moves.

The bishop on e4 is currently very active and controls important diagonals. Moving it to f3 would attack White's king on f2, creating a check. This would force White to respond to the check and give me the initiative.

g8h8,g8g7,f8f7

Player_Black (to Proxy):

I can see that I'm playing as Black and I have three legal moves:
1. g8h8 - Moving my king from g8 to h8
2. g8g7 - Moving my king from g8 to g7
3. f8f7 - Moving my rook from f8 to f7

Let me analyze the position:
- I have a king on g8 and a rook on f8
- White has a king on f6 and appears to be in a relatively advanced position
- I need to ensure my king's safety while maintaining control with my rook

Among my options, f8f7 seems strongest as it keeps my rook active and controls the 7th rank, which could be important for defense or potential counterplay. Moving the king to h8 or g7 doesn't improve my position as much as keeping the rook active.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

I need to analyze this position carefully. I'm playing as Black and have several options.

Looking at the board:
- I have a rook on f6, a bishop on g2, and my king on g8
- White has a rook on c3, a bishop on e5, and the king on e5
- There's material imbalance but I have active pieces

The most critical moves to consider:
1. Bishop moves (g2): My bishop on g2 is very active and can potentially deliver check or capture material
2. King moves: I should consider king safety
3. Pawn moves: Less urgent in this position

The bishop on g2 is particularly powerful, controlling the long diagonal. I can either use it to check White's king with g2-e4, or capture the bishop on e5 with g2-d5.

After analysis, capturing the bishop with g2d5 looks strongest as it eliminates a dangerous piece and maintains my material advantage.

2. King safety: My king is on g8 and can move to h8, f8, or g7.
3. Threats: I need to check for any immediate threats or tactical opportunities.

Looking at my bishop on d5, it has many diagonal moves available and appears to be well-positioned. The bishop on d5 is a strong piece controlling several diagonals.

After evaluating the position, I'll make a move with my bishop to capture White's pawn on e4, which strengthens my position and gains material.

Looking at my legal moves, I notice my bishop on e4 has many options. The most critical aspect of this position is safety of my king and potential threats.

The white rook on b5 is a threat, and the bishop on f6 is controlling important squares around my king. I should consider either defending against threats or creating counterplay.

One strong move is to capture the bishop on f6 with my king:

- I'm playing as Black with my king on f6
- White has a rook on a8 and d3, a bishop on f6, and the king on e2
- I have a bishop on e4 which is currently attacking diagonally
- Material is roughly even, but position is critical

Key observations:
- My bishop on e4 is very active and has several good options
- My king on f6 is somewhat exposed and needs to be careful about checks
- The white rook on d3 is threatening my position

The best move appears to be to use my bishop to create a decisive threat. The move e4g2 looks particularly strong as it:
1. Attacks the white king on e2
2. Forks the king and rook on d3
3. Cannot be captured immediately

You are a professional chess player and you play as black. Now is your turn to make a move. Before making a move you can pick one of the following actions:
- 'get_current_board' to get the schema and current status of the board
- 'get_legal_moves' to get a UCI formatted list of available moves
- 'make_move <UCI formatted move>' when you are ready to complete your turn (e.g., 'make_move e2e4')

I need to analyze this position carefully. 

I'm playing as Black and I see that:
- I have a king on f6 and a bishop on g2
- White has a king on e5, rooks on a8 and d3, and a bishop on e8
- The pawn structure is complex with several pawns for both sides

Looking at my legal moves, I notice my bishop on g2 has several strong options. The bishop is currently very active and can control important diagonals. 

The best move appears to be to use my bishop to attack White's rook on d3, which is undefended:

I can see the current position and my legal moves. Let me analyze the situation:

1. I'm playing as Black with my king on f6
2. White has a king on e5, rooks on b1 and d3, and a bishop on e1
3. I have a bishop on e4 which is currently attacking White's king
4. White's king is on e5, and my king on f6 is nearby

Looking at my legal moves:
- King moves: f6g7, f6e7, f6g5, f6f5, f6e5
- Pawn move: c7d6

The move f6e5 would capture White's king, which would immediately win the game. In chess, capturing the king isn't actually a legal move (the game ends at checkmate), so this suggests the White king is in check and this is a checkmate position.

I'm playing as Black with my king on e4. White has rooks on c3 and d3, a bishop on e1, and the white king is on e2. I have a bishop on e5, and several pawns.

Looking at my options:
- My bishop on e5 can move to d6 or f5
- My king on e4 has multiple moves
- I can advance my pawns on a7 or c7

The most critical aspect is my king's safety. I notice that White's rook on d3 is attacking along the d-file, and I should be careful about potential checks.

One strong move is to move my bishop to f5, which protects my king and puts pressure on White's position.

I need to analyze the position carefully before making my move.

Looking at the board, I see that:
- I'm playing as Black with my king on f5
- White has two rooks (a8 and d6) and a bishop (e8)
- I have a bishop on h1 that has several diagonal moves available
- White's king is on d1

The most critical aspect is my king's safety. White's rook on d6 is threatening my position, and I need to address this immediately.

Among my options:
- Moving my king (f5e5, f5g5, f5e4, f5g4)
- Using my bishop on h1 for attack or defense
- Moving a pawn

My bishop on h1 has the powerful move h1e4, which would attack White's king and rook simultaneously, creating a strong tactical threat. This is a classic fork that would force White to move their king, allowing me to capture the rook on the next move.

Now I understand the position. As Black, I have only two legal moves for my bishop on f5:
1. f5g5 - Moving the bishop to g5
2. f5e5 - Moving the bishop to e5

Let me analyze the position:
- I'm playing as Black with my king on f6
- My bishop on f5 is the only piece I can move
- White has two rooks (a8 and d6), a bishop on d4, and the king on d1
- The position looks quite difficult for Black

Between the two options:
- Moving to g5 (f5g5) doesn't seem to improve my position and might expose my bishop to capture
- Moving to e5 (f5e5) protects the e5 square and maintains control of the diagonal

I'll choose to move my bishop to e5:

You are a professional chess player and you play as black. Now is your turn to make a move. Before making a move you can pick one of the following actions:
- 'get_current_board' to get the schema and current status of the board
- 'get_legal_moves' to get a UCI formatted list of available moves
- 'make_move <UCI formatted move>' when you are ready to complete your turn (e.g., 'make_move e2e4')

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

After analyzing the position and my available legal moves, I see several key options:

1. I can move my king (e5d6 or e5f5)
2. I have multiple bishop moves from e4
3. I can advance my pawns

The most critical factor is my king's safety. White has two rooks (on b1 and d4) and a bishop (on e1). My bishop on e4 is a strong piece controlling several diagonals.

I'll move my bishop to f3, which maintains control of important diagonals while putting pressure on White's position. This move maintains my bishop's activity and indirectly protects my king.

After analyzing the position, I can see I have several options:

1. My king can move to d6, f5, or e4
2. My bishop on f3 has multiple moves available
3. I can advance my pawns on a7 or c7

The position looks quite complex. White has two rooks (on b1 and d3) and a bishop on e1, while I have a bishop on f3 and my king is somewhat exposed on e4.

Since my king is in the center and potentially vulnerable to attack from White's rooks, improving my king's position seems important. Moving the bishop to protect the king or create threats could also be valuable.

I'll move my bishop to d5, which puts pressure on White's position while protecting my king from the rook on d3:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

I need to carefully analyze this position as Black. 

I see that I'm playing as Black with my king on e5 and a bishop on d5. White has rooks on a8 and g7, a bishop on e8, and the white king is on c3. There are various pawns for both sides.

Looking at my legal moves, I notice several key options:
- I can move my king to f5 or e4
- I can move my bishop to various squares
- I can advance my pawns on a7 or h7

The most critical factor is my king's safety. With White's rook on g7, I need to be careful about potential checks. Moving my bishop to protect against threats or create counterplay is important.

After evaluation, I'll move my bishop to g8, which defends the h7 pawn and maintains control of the long diagonal while getting out of potential threats.

Let me check what legal moves I have available.

Now I can see my legal moves. Let me analyze the position:

I have my bishop on g7 that can move to several squares (g8f7, g8e6, g8d5, g8c4, g8b3, g8a2), my king on e5 with several options (e5f6, e5e6, e5d6, e5f5, e5d5, e5e4), and my pawn on a7 can move (a7a6, a7a5).

Looking at the position, I notice that my king is in the center on e5. White has a rook on g2 which could be dangerous if I'm not careful. I should prioritize king safety while maintaining control of the position.

The move e5d5 looks solid, keeping my king centralized while avoiding any immediate threats. This maintains my king's influence in the center and keeps it flexible for future moves.

3. I have a bishop on g7
4. There are various pawns for both sides

The move d5e4 looks promising because:
1. It moves toward the center of the board
2. It approaches White's king, which could be useful in an endgame
3. It's not immediately threatened by White's pieces
4. It controls more squares

The move g8d5 looks particularly strong as it:
- Puts my bishop on a central square

- Creates a potential fork threat against White's pieces
- Maintains good control of important squares

I need to analyze this position carefully as Black.

Looking at the board:
- I have a bishop on d5 that's actively placed
- My king is on e4
- White has a rook on a1 and g6, and a bishop on e1
- White's king is on c2

The most critical aspects of this position:
- My bishop on d5 is my strongest piece and has good diagonal control
- I need to be careful about potential checks from White's rooks

Among my legal moves:
- Moving my king to safety is a priority
- Using my bishop effectively could be decisive

After evaluation, I believe the best move is to move my king to f5, which improves my king's position while maintaining control of key squares.

You are a professional chess player and you play as black. Now is your turn to make a move. Before making a move you can pick one of the following actions:
- 'get_current_board' to get the schema and current status of the board
- 'get_legal_moves' to get a UCI formatted list of available moves
- 'make_move <UCI formatted move>' when you are ready to complete your turn (e.g., 'make_move e2e4')

I'll help you make a move as Black in this chess game. Let's first check the current board position.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

I can see the current position and my legal moves. Let me analyze the situation:

I'm playing as Black with my king on f5. I have a bishop on d5 and pawns on a7, c7, h7, and h6. 

White has a king on c2, rooks on a8 and g6, a bishop on d8, and pawns on b4, c3, d8, and h4.

My legal moves are:
- f5f6: Moving my king up
- f5e5: Moving my king left
- f5f4: Moving my king down
- f5e4: Moving my king diagonally down-left
- d5e6: Moving my bishop diagonally up-right

Looking at the position, I notice White's rook on g6 is a threat. If I move my king to f6, I'd be in check from that rook. Moving to e5 seems safer and maintains control of important squares.

The bishop move to e6 could be interesting to maintain diagonal control, but I think securing my king position is more important right now.

- My king is somewhat exposed on e5
- White's rook on f6 is a potential threat

Looking at the best move:
1. The bishop on d5 is my most active piece and can potentially create threats
2. Moving the bishop to f3 would put pressure on White's position and control important squares

I'll move my bishop to f3:

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Thank you for providing the legal moves. Let me analyze the position and make a decision.

Key observations:
- My king is on e5 with several safe moves available
- My bishop on g4 has multiple diagonal options
- I have pawns on a7, c7, h6, and h7
- White's rook on h8 is threatening my h-pawns
- White's king is far away on c2

The most pressing issue is the white rook on h8 threatening my h-pawns. I should consider either defending them or creating counterplay elsewhere.

Looking at my bishop on g4, I see it can move to e6, which would protect my h-pawns from the rook. This seems like a strong defensive move that also maintains control of important central squares.

The most critical threat is the rook on d8. I should either capture it or move my king to safety. Looking at my legal moves, I notice my bishop can capture the rook.

I'll capture the white rook with my bishop:

- King moves: e5f6, e5e6, e5f5, e5f4, e5e4
- Pawn moves: a7a6, a7a5

This is a critical position. White's rook on d7 is threatening my c7 pawn. My king is also somewhat exposed. Let me analyze the best move:

1. Moving my king to e4, f4, or f5 would be dangerous as it could lead to checks from White's rook.
2. Moving to e6 would block the rook's attack on my c7 pawn, but might expose my king to other threats.
3. Moving to f6 gets my king away from the center but doesn't address the threat to my c7 pawn.
4. The pawn moves don't directly address the immediate threats.

The most urgent issue is protecting my c7 pawn from the rook on d7. Moving my king to e6 accomplishes this by blocking the rook's attack line.

Thank you for providing the legal moves. Let me analyze the position:

I'm playing as Black with my king on e6 and pawns on a7, c7, h6, and h8. White has a rook on h7 and pawns on c3 and b4.

Key considerations:
- White's rook on h7 is threatening my h6 pawn
- My king needs to stay connected to my pawns for support
- I should try to advance my a-pawn when possible

Looking at my options:
1. King moves (e6f6, e6d6, e6f5, e6e5, e6d5)
2. Pawn moves (a7a6, a7a5)

The most pressing issue is protecting my h6 pawn from the rook on h7. Moving my king to f6 would defend this pawn. Additionally, the f6 square allows my king to stay centralized and maintain influence.

You are a professional chess player and you play as black. Now is your turn to make a move. Before making a move you can pick one of the following actions:

- 'get_legal_moves' to get a UCI formatted list of available moves
- 'make_move <UCI formatted move>' when you are ready to complete your turn (e.g., 'make_move e2e4')

Player_Black (to Proxy):

I see the position now. As Black, I have a king on f6 and pawns on a7, h7, and h4. White has a king on c2, a rook on c7, and pawns on c3 and b4.

Looking at my legal moves, I need to make a decision based on the current position:

1. King moves: f6e6, f6g5, f6f5, f6e5
2. Pawn moves: a7a6, a7a5

The white rook on c7 is currently attacking my a7 pawn. My king is not in check, but I need to address this threat. Moving the a-pawn would lose material, so I should use my king to defend against White's threats.

The best move appears to be to move my king to e6, which maintains control of the center, stays away from the edge of the board, and prepares to potentially help defend the a-pawn if needed.

I can see the current board position. I'm playing as Black, and I notice my king is on e6, with pawns on a7, h6, and h7. White has a rook on c8, pawns on b7 and c7, and the white king on c2.

Let me check what legal moves I have available.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Now I can see my legal moves. I need to make a careful decision here.

Looking at the position, I notice White's rook on c8 is a major threat. My king is on e6, and I need to ensure its safety while potentially improving my position.

My options are:
- Move my king (e6f6, e6d6, e6f5, e6e5, e6d5)
- Move my a-pawn (a7b6, a7a6, a7a5)

Since the white rook on c8 controls the c-file, I should avoid moving my king to d6 as that would put me in check. Moving to e5 or d5 would bring me closer to the white king, which isn't ideal.

I think the best move is to move my king to f6, keeping distance from the white rook while maintaining control of my pawns on the h-file.

- I'm playing as Black with my king on f6
- White has a king on c1 and a rook on c7
- There are pawns on a7, b6, c6, h7, and h6
- White's rook on c7 is attacking my a7 pawn

Let me check what legal moves I have available.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Now I understand my options. Let me analyze the best move:

1. King moves (f6e6, f6g5, f6f5, f6e5):
   - Moving my king is generally safe, but I should consider which direction is most strategic
   - f6e5 would move diagonally toward the center, which is usually good for kings

2. Pawn moves (a7b6, a7a6, a7a5):
   - a7b6 would capture White's pawn on b6, gaining material
   - a7a6 or a7a5 would advance the pawn but lose it to White's rook on c7

The clear best move is to capture White's pawn with a7b6, which gains material and removes an enemy pawn.

Let me check what legal moves I have available.

Now I can see my legal moves. I have:

1. f6e6 - Moving my king from f6 to e6
2. f6g5 - Moving my king from f6 to g5
3. f6f5 - Moving my king from f6 to f5
4. f6e5 - Moving my king from f6 to e5
5. b6b5 - Moving a pawn from b6 to b5 (I see this is actually a b7 pawn from the board display)

Looking at the position, I need to consider my king's safety and potential advancement of my pawns. The white rook on a8 is currently not directly threatening anything, but I should be careful about potential checks.

I'll move my king to e5, which centralizes it and allows me to potentially support my pawns later while staying away from the edge of the board where the white king could trap me.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

I need to analyze this position carefully as Black.

Looking at the board:
- I'm playing as Black with my king on e5
- White has a king on c1
- White has a rook on a7
- White has pawns on c7 and h7
- I have pawns on b6 and h6

The most critical aspect is that White's rook on a7 is currently not attacking me, but could potentially deliver a check if I move poorly. I need to be careful about my king's position.

My options:
1. Move my king (to f6, e6, d6, f5, d5, f4, e4, or d4)
2. Move my pawn from b6 to b5

Since I'm not in check, I should consider improving my position. Moving my king toward White's king is generally good in endgames, and I should try to keep the opposition when possible.

Moving to d4 seems strong as it approaches White's king while maintaining control of key squares. This move also stays away from the a-file, avoiding potential rook checks.

Thank you for providing the legal moves. Let me analyze the position:

I'm playing as Black with my king on d4 and have 9 legal moves:
- King moves: d4e5, d4d5, d4c5, d4e4, d4c4, d4e3, d4d3, d4c3
- Pawn move: b6b5

Key considerations:
1. White's rook on b7 is threatening my b6 pawn
2. If I move the pawn with b6b5, White's rook can capture it
3. I need to keep my king safe while potentially addressing the threat to my pawn

Looking at the position, I should keep my king centralized and possibly move toward the b6 pawn to protect it. Moving to c5 seems good as it maintains king centrality, approaches my pawn, and doesn't walk into any immediate threats.

Now I understand the position. As Black, I have my king on c5 with four possible moves: b6, d5, d4, or c4.

Looking at the board:
- White has a king on c1
- White has a rook on b2
- White has pawns on c2 and h4
- Black has pawns on h3 and h4

This is a critical position. I need to be careful about the white rook on b2 which controls the b-file. My best move is to move my king to d5, which keeps me away from the rook's influence and maintains control of the center.

You are a professional chess player and you play as black. Now is your turn to make a move. Before making a move you can pick one of the following actions:
- 'get_current_board' to get the schema and current status of the board
- 'get_legal_moves' to get a UCI formatted list of available moves
- 'make_move <UCI formatted move>' when you are ready to complete your turn (e.g., 'make_move e2e4')

I see the current position. I'm playing as Black with my king on d4. White has a king on c1, a rook on h3, and pawns on c2 and h4. Let me check what legal moves I have available.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Now I understand my available moves. As Black, I have my king on d5 (not d4 as I initially thought), and I can move to e5, c5, e4, d4, or c4.

Looking at the position:
- White has a rook on h3 and pawns on c2 and h4
- White's king is on c1
- My king is on d5

I need to be careful about the white rook on h3, which controls the h-file. Moving to e4 would be dangerous as it could allow the rook to check me later.

The best move appears to be to move my king toward White's c2 pawn while staying safe from the rook. Moving to c4 accomplishes this by approaching the c2 pawn while staying away from the h-file.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

I see my available moves. I'm playing as Black with my king on c4, and White has a king on c1 and a rook on g3, with pawns on c2 and h4.

Looking at the position, I need to be careful of the white rook on g3. My priority is to keep my king safe while potentially making progress. Let me analyze my options:

- Moving to d5, c5, or b5 advances my king, but I need to check if these are safe from the rook
- Moving to d4, b4 keeps my king on the 4th rank
- Moving to d3, c3, b3 moves my king backward

The white rook on g3 controls the g-file and the 3rd rank, so moving to c3 would be walking into a check. The h4 pawn is not an immediate threat.

I'll move my king to d5, which advances my position and keeps me away from the rook's control.

Now I can see all my legal moves. As Black responding to White's Nf3, I have several good options:

1. e7e5 - This is a classical response, taking control of the center
2. d7d5 - Another strong central pawn move
3. g8f6 - Developing the knight to a good square, mirroring White's development
4. b8c6 - Developing the knight to support central control

Among these, I'll choose to develop my knight to f6, which is a solid response to White's Nf3. This move develops a piece, controls the center squares e4 and d5, and prepares for kingside castling later.

Looking at the position, I notice I can capture that knight with my own knight from f6. This would be a good move as it eliminates White's piece without weakening my position.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

After analyzing the position and my legal moves, I need to address White's knight on f6, which is attacking my g7 pawn and creating pressure.

The most principled response is to capture the knight with my h5 knight:

make_move h5f6

This captures White's knight, eliminating the immediate threat to my g7 pawn. This is a good move because:
1. It removes White's aggressive piece
2. It develops one of my pieces
3. It maintains control of the center

After this capture, I'll be able to continue with normal development moves like e7-e5 or d7-d5 in future turns.

2. I could move my knight to safety with f6h5 or other squares
3. I could defend my knight with g7g6 or e7e6

The most principled response is to develop a piece while challenging White's knight. I'll develop my knight to c6, which is a natural developing move that follows opening principles.

- Developing my light-squared bishop with f8e7 (though this isn't listed in legal moves, so the bishop must be on c8)

Since I want to control the center and develop my pieces, I'll play e7e6, which will allow me to develop my light-squared bishop and prepare for castling.

I can see the current board position. White has developed their knight to f3 and bishop to b2, and has pushed pawns to b3 and e3. I should now check what legal moves I have available.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Now I have a clear picture of the position and my legal moves. Let me analyze the situation:

White has developed their knight to f3 and bishop to b2, and has pushed pawns to b3 and e3. As Black, I should focus on development and control of the center.

Looking at my options, I think developing a piece and controlling the center would be best. The move e6e5 stands out as it:
1. Stakes a claim in the center
2. Opens lines for my bishop on f8 and queen on d8
3. Challenges White's control of the center

This is a standard response in many openings to help establish central control.

I'll analyze the position:

I'm playing as Black, and I notice White has developed a knight to f4, attacking my e5 pawn. White also has a bishop on b2 and has pushed the e-pawn to e3. My knights are developed to c6 and f6, but I need to address the threat to my e5 pawn.

Looking at my options:
- I could defend the e5 pawn with moves like f6d5 or f6e4
- I could develop pieces with moves like f8e7 or d8e7
- I could ignore the threat and develop elsewhere

The most principled move is to defend the e5 pawn while developing. Knight to d5 (f6d5) looks strong as it defends e5 and places my knight on a central square.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

I need to analyze the position carefully before making my move.

I notice White has developed their knight to f3 and has a bishop on b2 targeting my kingside. My knight on c6 is developed, and I have a knight on d5 that's quite active in the center. White has also pushed their e-pawn to e5, creating some space.

Looking at my options, I should focus on development while maintaining control of the center. The knight on d5 is well-placed but could be under threat from White's f-pawn or c-pawn in the future.

I think developing my dark-squared bishop to e7 is a solid choice here. This develops a piece, protects my king, and prepares for castling.

I see the position now. I'm playing as Black and have several good options. 

Looking at the position, I notice:
- I have both knights developed
- My king is in the center
- I have the option to castle kingside (e8g8)
- White has developed some pieces but doesn't appear to have immediate threats

Castling kingside would be a strong move here to improve my king's safety. This is typically a priority in the opening/early middlegame.

- White has developed pieces and has some central pawns

One of the strongest moves I see is developing my bishop on e7 to a more active square. The bishop on e7 has several good options, particularly e7-g5 which pins White's knight to their queen.

I need to analyze the position carefully before making my move.

Looking at the board, I see that:
- I'm playing as Black
- The position appears to be in the middle game
- I have knights on c6 and d5, bishops on g5 and c8
- White has a knight on g3 and a bishop on b2

One of my strongest pieces is the knight on d5, which is centralized and putting pressure on several squares. I also notice my bishop on g5 is actively placed.

Among my options, I see that I could:
1. Develop my rook with f8e8 or a8b8
2. Move my centralized knight on d5 to a strong square
3. Advance a pawn to improve my position

The knight on d5 is particularly strong, and I see I can move it to f4 (d5f4), which would attack White's pawn on e2 and potentially create tactical opportunities.

I'll make this move:

Looking at the position strategically, I think one of the strongest moves is to activate my knight on f4 by moving it to d5, creating a strong central outpost and threatening White's pieces.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

After analyzing the position and the available legal moves, I can see I'm playing as Black in a complex middlegame position. I have several pieces developed, including knights on c6 and d5, and a bishop on g5.

The knight on d5 is particularly strong, occupying a central outpost. I notice White has a bishop on b5 that could potentially capture my knight on c6, which would damage my pawn structure.

I think one of my best moves is to protect the c6 knight while developing my queenside. I'll play:

make_move a8b8

This develops my rook to a semi-open b-file, connects my rooks, and indirectly protects the knight on c6 (since if White captures on c6, I can recapture with the b8 rook). This is a solid developing move that improves my position.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Let me analyze the position as Black:

I notice I have two knights (c6 and d5) and a bishop on g5 that are actively placed. The position seems fairly open with potential for tactical play.

Looking at my options:
- My knight on d5 is particularly well-positioned, controlling several key squares
- The bishop on g5 is also active and could potentially pin a white piece
- I should consider development and king safety

Among my legal moves, I see some interesting possibilities:
- d5e3 would fork White's queen and possibly another piece
- g5e3 would attack White's queen
- c6d4 could improve my knight's position

Let me check if d5e3 is indeed a fork. The knight would move to e3, attacking White's queen on c2. This looks like a strong tactical move.

The position appears to be in the middle game with both sides having developed pieces. I notice my king is on g8 with a rook on f8, and I have a bishop on f6 that could be under attack from White's knight on f4. I also see I have a knight on c6 that has several potential moves.

Looking at the legal moves, I should prioritize safety and development. The knight on c6 has good options, particularly c6e7 which would protect the f5 square and potentially prepare for a kingside defense.

I'll make this move:

- My king is on g8 with a rook on f8

One strong move would be to develop my knight to c6, which would protect my d-pawn and prepare for potential central control. This is a natural developing move that improves my position.

After analyzing the position and my available legal moves, I can see I'm playing as Black with a fairly developed position. I notice my king is on g8, and I have both rooks, both bishops, a knight on c6, and my queen on d8.

I should prioritize king safety and piece coordination. Looking at the position, I see that my e5 pawn is under attack by a White knight on f3, and I should consider how to address that.

Among my options:
- I could defend the e5 pawn with moves like f6e7 (Bf6-e7) or c6e7 (Nc6-e7)
- I could move the e5 pawn forward with e5e4
- I could develop my pieces further or improve my king's safety

The move e5e4 looks particularly strong as it advances my central pawn, attacks the knight on f3, and gains space. This is a typical central break that can give me good counterplay.

I see that I'm playing as Black and there appears to be some tactical tension on the board. White has a queen on c3 and bishops on a1 and b4, with knights on f4 and b1. My pieces are mostly in their starting positions, though I have knights on c6 and f6, and a bishop on f6.

Looking at the legal moves, I need to consider:
1. Any immediate threats from White
2. Development opportunities
3. Control of the center
4. King safety

I notice White's knight on f4 is attacking my e-pawn, and there's pressure on the board. One strong developing move would be to castle kingside, which also improves my king's safety.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

I can see the current position and my legal moves. Let me analyze the situation:

1. I'm playing as Black and have a knight on c6 and f6, bishops on f6 and b8, and my king is on g8.
2. White has a queen on c3 which is quite active, and a bishop on b4 that's pinning my c6 knight to my queen.
3. White also has a knight on f4 that's attacking my e-pawn.

Looking at my options, I should address these threats and improve my position. The move Nf6-e4 (f6e4) would be strong, but it's not in my legal moves list, so the e4 square must be controlled by White.

I think one of my best options is to develop my bishop from f6 to g5, which attacks White's queen and creates a threat.

After analyzing the position, I can see several key elements:

1. I'm playing as Black and my king is on g8
2. White has a strong attack with the queen on c3 and pieces aimed at my kingside
3. My bishop on g5 is under attack from White's h-pawn
4. I need to address the pressure on my kingside

Among my legal moves, I should prioritize king safety and address immediate threats. The bishop on g5 is under attack and needs to be moved. Moving it to f6 would protect my g7 pawn and maintain control of key central squares.

2. White has a knight on f4 and a queen on c3, creating some pressure
3. My king is on g8 with rooks on b8 and f8
4. I have a bishop on f6 that could develop

Looking at my options, I should address the threat to my knight and improve my position. The move Nd4 looks strong as it:
- Moves my knight out of danger from the bishop on b4
- Attacks White's queen on c3
- Controls central squares
- Creates potential tactical opportunities

I'll make this move:

Looking at the position critically:
- My knight on d4 is attacking White's queen on c2
- I could develop my pieces further or improve my position
- I should consider potential threats from White

One of the strongest moves appears to be moving my knight to c2, which would fork White's king and rook. This is a powerful tactic that would win material.

I notice my knight on e3 is quite active and has multiple potential moves. I also see that White has a bishop on b4 that could be threatening my queenside, and a knight on f4 that's in an advanced position.

One strong move would be to develop my rook with either f8e8 or f8g8, connecting my rooks. Another good option would be to activate my knight on e3 by moving to a strong square.

Looking at the position more carefully, I see that my knight on e3 can move to f5, which would be a strong central outpost and put pressure on White's position.

I'll make this move:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Let me analyze the position and my available moves:

I notice I'm playing as Black and have several interesting options. The position appears to be in the middle game with both kings castled. I need to consider my development, king safety, and potential tactical opportunities.

Looking at the knight on f6, it's well-placed but could potentially move to e4 to attack White's queen on c3. However, that move isn't listed as legal, suggesting there might be a pin or other tactical reason preventing it.

The bishop on f5 has several good options, including potentially moving to g3 to attack White's kingside.

I also notice my e-pawn has advanced to e4, which is quite aggressive and could be pushed further to e3.

After evaluating the options, I think advancing my e-pawn to e3 is strong, putting pressure on White's position and potentially threatening the queen if it moves.

Looking at the board, I notice:
- White has a queen on c3 and bishops on a1 and b4
- I have knights on f6 and a bishop on f5
- My king is on g8 with rooks on b8 and f8
- There's a pawn on e3 that could be advanced

Among my options, I see several strong candidates:
- Advancing e3-e2 threatens to promote
- Knight moves like Nf6-e4 could improve my piece position
- Bishop f5 has several good squares

The pawn on e3 is particularly valuable as it's close to promotion. I should prioritize this asset.

After analyzing the position, I see several key aspects:

1. I have both knights and bishops developed
2. White has a queen on e5 that's quite active
3. My king is still in the center (e8) with castling options available

One of the most important moves in this position would be to castle and get my king to safety. I have both kingside and queenside castling available, but kingside looks safer.

I'll castle kingside:

Player_Black (to Proxy):

I'll analyze the position to make the best move as Black.

Looking at the board:
- I'm down a piece (missing a knight)
- White has a strong queen on b3 threatening my queenside
- My king is on g8 with rooks on b8 and h8
- I have a knight on f6 and bishops on f5 and d8
- White has a bishop on b4 threatening my queenside

Key considerations:
1. King safety is important
2. I should develop my pieces and improve my position
3. I need to watch for White's threats

Among my options, I see that I can develop my queen's bishop with Bf5-e7, which would protect my king and connect my rooks. This is a solid developing move that improves my position.

- I have both my bishops (f6 and f8) and a knight on e7
- The pawn structure is relatively intact

Looking at my options, I need to prioritize development and king safety. My knight on e7 has several good options, including Nc6 which would develop it to a good square.

The bishop on f6 also has several potential moves, including Bd4 which would put pressure on the center.

After considering the available moves, I'll develop my knight to c6, which improves my position by controlling important central squares and preparing for potential queenside play.

2. Material seems roughly equal, though White has a queen on h5
3. I have a knight on e5 that has several good options
4. My king is on g8 with rooks on b8 and h8

Looking at my knight on e5, it has several strong options. The move e5f3 looks particularly attractive as it would attack White's king on e1 and possibly the queen on h5 simultaneously (a knight fork).

I need to analyze the position carefully before making my move.

Looking at the board, I notice:
- I'm playing as Black
- White has a queen on h5 that could be threatening
- I have a pawn on e2 that can be promoted
- I have knights on f3 and f6

The most powerful move available is promoting my e2 pawn to a queen with e2e1q. This creates a new queen and would likely be with check to the white king on f2.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

After analyzing the position and available moves, I notice I have two queens (one on d8 and another on c3), which gives me a significant material advantage. The white king is exposed on e4, and I can immediately exploit this with my queen on c3.

I'll play a powerful move that directly attacks the white king:

make_move c3e3

This move puts my queen on e3, delivering a check to the white king on e4. The king will be forced to move, and I'll maintain pressure. This is a strong attacking move that takes advantage of White's exposed king position.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

After analyzing the position, I can see I'm playing as Black and have several options. 

The position shows White has a strong attack with the queen on e5 and a rook on c4. My king is on g8, and I need to be careful about potential threats.

Looking at my options, I notice:
1. My bishop on f6 is active and has several possible moves
2. I could develop my rooks or queen
3. I can make various pawn moves

The most pressing concern is safety, as White's queen on e5 is threatening my position. I should prioritize king safety and counterplay.

One strong move is to connect my rooks by moving my king:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

I need to analyze this position carefully before making my move.

Looking at the board, I notice:
- White has a queen on b3 and a bishop on a4, putting pressure on my queenside
- My king is on h8 with a rook on f8
- White's king is on e5, quite advanced
- Material seems roughly equal

Given the available moves, I should prioritize safety and development. The most critical area seems to be my queenside where White's queen and bishop are active.

I'll play a solid move to defend against potential threats and improve my position:

make_move b7b6

This move:
1. Defends the a7 pawn against potential threats
2. Prepares to develop my bishop to b7 later
3. Maintains a solid pawn structure
4. Doesn't weaken my king's position

I notice White has a bishop on a4 and a knight on b2, with the white king on d4. My king is on g8, and I have both rooks and my queen still on the board.

Looking at my options, I should prioritize safety and development. The move d7d5 stands out as it:
1. Controls the center
2. Opens lines for my bishop on c8
3. Challenges White's control of the center

This is a solid classical move that improves my position and gives me good development options.

2. My king is on g8 with rooks on b8 and f8
3. I have a queen on d8 and a bishop on c8
4. The pawn structure is relatively intact

Looking at the position, I notice a few key opportunities:
- I can develop my bishop with c8f5, which would put pressure on the center
- My queen can move to e7 to increase central control
- I could consider castling by moving g8h8

After evaluating these options, I believe developing my bishop to f5 is the strongest move. It develops a piece, controls important central squares, and puts pressure on White's position.

I notice that:
- White's queen is on d4 attacking my bishop on f6
- My queen on d8 is undefended
- White's king is on d4, somewhat exposed
- I have a bishop on f5 with many possible moves

Looking at the legal moves, I see several strong options:

1. I could move my bishop to safety with moves like f5e6 or f5g6
2. I could attack White's queen with f5e4
3. I could check White's king with f5c2

The move f5c2+ looks particularly strong as it gives check and attacks White's queen simultaneously (a fork). This would force White to move their king and then I can capture the queen.

Looking at my options, I notice my bishop on c2 has several strong moves. In particular, the move c2e4 looks very powerful as it would:
- Attack the white queen on d4
- Create a discovered attack from my rook on f8 toward White's king
- Put pressure on White's position

This is a tactical opportunity I should capitalize on.

- The bishop on e4 has several strong options, particularly e4f3 which attacks White's king on c3
- My queen on d8 could develop with moves like d8d5
- I could also castle with g8h8

The most critical move appears to be e4f3+, which puts White's king in check and creates a strong tactical threat.

You are a professional chess player and you play as black. Now is your turn to make a move. Before making a move you can pick one of the following actions:
- 'get_current_board' to get the schema and current status of the board
- 'get_legal_moves' to get a UCI formatted list of available moves
- 'make_move <UCI formatted move>' when you are ready to complete your turn (e.g., 'make_move e2e4')

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Now I have a clear picture of the position and my available moves. Let me analyze the situation:

I'm playing as Black and have several tactical opportunities. I notice my bishop on f3 is attacking along the diagonal and has multiple potential moves. The position appears to be in the middlegame with queens still on the board.

Looking at my legal moves, I see that my bishop on f3 has several strong options. In particular, the move f3d5 looks very promising as it attacks the white queen on d4. This would force White to move the queen or lose it.

I'll make this move:

I can see all my legal moves now. Let me analyze the position:

I'm playing as Black and I notice:
- White has a rook on d4 that's attacking my c-pawn
- White's king is on c3, somewhat exposed
- I have my queen on d8 and rooks on b8 and f8

Looking at my options, I should prioritize safety and development. The rook on d4 is threatening my c7 pawn, so I should consider addressing that threat.

One strong move would be to bring my queen to e8, connecting my rooks while maintaining control of important squares.

I'll analyze the position carefully:

I'm playing as Black and I notice several key elements:
- White has a rook on d4 threatening my queen on e8
- My king is on g8 with limited mobility
- I have rooks on b8 and f8
- White's king is on c3, quite exposed

Given the immediate threat to my queen, I need to address that first. I can either move the queen or defend against the rook's attack.

Looking at my options, moving the queen to d8 seems strong as it:
1. Protects the queen from the rook's attack
2. Maintains control of important squares
3. Aligns with my rook on b8, creating a powerful battery on the d-file

I'll make this move:

I notice that my king is on g8 with a rook on f8, and White has a rook on d4 that could be threatening me. My queen on d8 has several options, and I have two rooks that could be developed.

One of the strongest moves appears to be connecting my rooks by moving my king to h8, which improves my king safety and prepares potential counterplay on the queenside.

Looking at my options, I should prioritize safety and potentially create counterplay. One strong move would be to connect my rooks with:

This defends my king, connects my rooks for better coordination, and maintains control of the back rank. This is a solid defensive move that improves my position.

I need to analyze this position carefully. 

I see that I'm playing as Black with my king on g8. White has a king on c3, a rook on d4, a bishop on a4, a knight on d1, and several pawns. My pieces include rooks on b8 and h8, and several pawns.

Looking at the legal moves, I notice that my king is not in check since I have many options. The most important considerations are:

1. Safety of my king
2. Activity of my pieces
3. Potential threats against White

One strong move would be to connect my rooks with `g8f8`, which improves my king safety and rook coordination.

Another good option is `b8a8`, which centralizes my rook on the open a-file.

After consideration, I'll choose to connect my rooks, which is a fundamental principle in chess endgames.

I'll analyze the position and my available moves:

This appears to be an endgame position where I'm playing as Black. I have my king on h8 with rooks on b8 and f8. White has a king on c3, a rook on d4, a bishop on a4, a knight on d1, and several pawns.

Key considerations:
1. My king safety is important
2. The activity of my rooks should be maximized
3. I should assess any immediate threats

Looking at my legal moves, I notice I can centralize one of my rooks with moves like f8e8 or b8e8, which would improve my rook's activity and control of the e-file.

The move b8e8 looks particularly strong as it centralizes my rook and puts pressure on the e-file. This gives me better control of the center and increases my rook's activity significantly.

4. There's a potential threat from White's rook on f6

Looking at my options, I should prioritize king safety and potentially activate my rooks. Since my king is on h8 and I have a rook on f8, I can castle kingside with Kg8, which would protect my king and connect my rooks.

4. Material seems roughly equal

Looking at my legal moves, I need to prioritize king safety and potentially activate my rooks. The e8 rook has many possible moves, which suggests it's not blocked.

I'll move my rook from e8 to e1, creating a threat down the e-file and potentially preparing for back rank threats against White's king. This active move puts pressure on White while maintaining my king's safety.

I need to address several threats. The most pressing issue is that my e7 pawn is under attack by the white rook on e5. I should also improve my king's safety.

Looking at my options, I'll move my king to h8, which is a safer square away from the center and creates more options for my rooks.

You are a professional chess player and you play as black. Now is your turn to make a move. Before making a move you can pick one of the following actions:
- 'get_current_board' to get the schema and current status of the board
- 'get_legal_moves' to get a UCI formatted list of available moves
- 'make_move <UCI formatted move>' when you are ready to complete your turn (e.g., 'make_move e2e4')

Player_Black (to Proxy):

I need to analyze this position carefully as Black.

Looking at the board:
- White has a rook on e5 and a bishop on a3, with the king on c3
- I have two rooks (d8 and f8) and my king is on h8
- White's rook on e5 is attacking my pawn on e7
- I need to consider safety and counterplay

The most pressing issue is the rook on e5 attacking my e7 pawn. I could defend it with a rook, but I should also consider if there are better moves.

Looking at my options, I notice I can connect my rooks with Kg8, which is generally a good idea. This would improve my king's safety and prepare for potential counterplay along the back rank.

Now I have a clear picture of the position and my available moves. Let me analyze the situation:

I'm playing as Black with my king on g8. I have rooks on d8 and f8, and pawns on a7, c7, f6, f7, and h7. White has a king on c3, a rook on e5, a bishop on d4, and several pawns.

Looking at my options:
- My rook on d8 is undefended and under attack by White's rook on e5
- I need to either move the d8 rook or defend it
- I could also consider counterattacks

The most pressing issue is my rook on d8. I should either move it to safety or defend it. Moving it to e8 would connect my rooks, which is generally good.

I'm playing as Black and I see that:
- I have two rooks on e8 and f8, with my king on g8
- White has a rook on e5 and a bishop on d4
- White's king is on c3

Looking at the legal moves, I need to consider my priorities:
1. Safety of my king
2. Counterattack opportunities
3. Piece coordination

The move g8h8 would move my king to the corner, which is often safer. However, I don't see an immediate threat requiring this.

The move e8e6 looks strong as it would place my rook on an active square, controlling the 6th rank and potentially threatening White's pawns.

I'll make this move:

Key observations:

- White's king is on d4, my king is on g8
- I have a strong rook on e6 that's currently attacking the e-file
- White has a bishop on d4 that could be dangerous

Looking at my options, I see a powerful move with my rook on e6. I can use it to create threats or gain control of more territory.

The move e6e2 looks particularly strong - it brings my rook to the 2nd rank where it can attack White's pawns and potentially create threats against White's king.

2. White's king is on d7, and they have a bishop on c4
3. I have several pawn moves and rook moves available

Looking at the position, I notice I have a rook on e2 that's already deep in White's territory. I should use this active rook to create threats or capture material. The most powerful move appears to be:

make_move e2e8

This move delivers a powerful check to White's king from the back rank. Since the king is on d7, it can't capture my rook. This is a strong attacking move that forces White to respond to the check.

I'm playing as Black and I have two rooks on e8 and f8, with my king on g8. White's king is on d6, and White has two bishops (on b2 and c4) and several pawns.

Looking at my options:
- I should prioritize safety for my king
- I notice my rook on e8 has control of the e-file and could potentially be active
- I should consider improving my position

Among my legal moves, I see that I can move my king to h8 (g8h8) which would be a safe square. I could also advance some pawns to gain space.

Given the position, I'll move my king to h8 which is a safe square and allows me to maintain my position while potentially preparing for future plans.

Looking at my options, I notice I can create a strong connected rook position by moving my king to g7, which would protect the f6 pawn and allow my rooks to potentially connect. This seems like a solid defensive move that maintains my position.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

I need to analyze this position carefully. 

I'm playing as Black and I see that:
- I have two rooks on e8 and f8
- My king is on g7
- White's king is on b4
- White has two bishops (c4 and b8) and some pawns

Looking at the legal moves, I notice I can make a rook move that could be decisive. Since White's king is exposed on b4, I can use my rook to deliver a check.

I'll move my rook from e8 to e4, putting White's king in check while also attacking from a distance.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

After analyzing the position, I see I'm playing as Black and have several good options. I have two rooks - one on f8 and one on e4. 

The rook on e4 is particularly strong, controlling the e-file and attacking White's position. I notice that my king is on g7, and I should consider both attacking opportunities and king safety.

One of the strongest moves here is to use my rook on e4 to attack the white king on b4. This creates an immediate threat and puts pressure on my opponent.

4. The pawn structure is important to consider

Looking at my options, I notice I can improve my rook's position. Moving the rook to h8 would place it on an open file and potentially prepare for future attacks.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

I can see this is an endgame position where I'm playing as Black. Let me analyze the position:

1. I have a rook on h8 and my king on g7
2. White has a king on b4, two bishops (a2 and b8), and some pawns
3. Material is roughly equal, but I have a rook vs White's two bishops

Looking at my legal moves, I need to make a strong move. The rook on h8 is currently undefended and could be captured by the bishop on b8. I should either move the rook to a safer square or defend it.

Moving my king to g6 (g7g6) would defend the rook while maintaining king safety. Alternatively, I could move the rook along the back rank to maintain control of the 8th rank.

I'll move my rook to g8, which defends it with my king and maintains control of the back rank:

4. There's a potential threat from the bishop on d4 which could check my king if I move incorrectly

Looking at my options, I should prioritize king safety while maintaining control. The rook on g8 is well-positioned, protecting my king from the side.

I'll move my king to f8, which:
- Gets my king away from the edge of the board
- Maintains protection from my rook
- Improves my king's position for the endgame
- Avoids any potential discovered checks

Looking at my options, I notice that my rook on g8 is undefended and could be captured by the bishop on c6 if I'm not careful. Moving the rook to h8 would keep it safe while maintaining control of the g-file.

Another consideration is advancing my f6 pawn to f5 to gain space and potentially create attacking chances.

After evaluating my options, I believe the best move is to protect my rook by moving it to h8.

- I have a rook on h8
- White's king is on a4, quite far from my position
- I have several pawn moves available

The most active move appears to be moving my rook to g8, which maintains control of the back rank while giving my king more flexibility.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

I'll analyze the position:

I'm playing as Black with my king on f8 and a rook on g8. White's king is on a4, and White has two bishops (on b8 and f3) and some pawns.

Looking at my legal moves, I notice:
- My rook on g8 can move along the g-file or to h8
- My king on f8 can move to e8, g7, or e7
- I have several pawn moves available

Key considerations:
1. Safety of my king
2. Activity of my rook
3. Potential threats from White's bishops

The move f8e8 looks good as it keeps my king protected while maintaining the rook's defense. This allows me to centralize my king slightly while keeping my rook active.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

I'll analyze the position:

I'm playing as Black with my king on e8 and a rook on g8. White has a king on a4 and two bishops (on b8 and e5). The position looks somewhat simplified.

Key considerations:
1. My rook on g8 is undefended and could be captured by the bishop on b8 via the diagonal
2. I should consider improving my king's position or activating my rook
3. I need to be careful about potential bishop checks

Looking at the legal moves, I have several good options:
- Moving my king to f8 would protect the rook and improve king centralization
- Moving my rook along the g-file could create threats
- Advancing pawns could help create space

I think the best move is to centralize my king while protecting my rook:

The move g8g4 looks strong as it:
- Places my rook on the 4th rank where it controls important squares
- Creates a potential threat against White's king on a4
- Maintains protection of my kingside pawns

Looking at the position, I notice my rook on g4 is very active and can potentially deliver a strong attack. Since White's king is exposed on a4, I can use my rook to attack.

The best move appears to be to bring my rook to the a-file to attack White's king:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

I need to analyze this position carefully as Black.

Looking at the board:
- I have my king on f8 with a white bishop on c1 and white king on b4
- I have a rook on a4 which is currently undefended
- White has a pawn on a5 and h5
- I need to consider both safety and active play

The most powerful piece I have is the rook on a4. I notice I can use it to check the white king with Ra4-b4, but that would lose the rook immediately.

Instead, I should consider:
1. King safety - moving my king to a safer square
2. Using my rook actively
3. Advancing pawns strategically

Given that the white king is somewhat exposed on b4, I can use my rook to apply pressure. Moving my rook to b4 would check the king but lose the rook. However, I can move the rook to c4, putting pressure on the position without immediately losing material.

2. I can advance my pawns: h7-h6, a7-a6, f6-f5, or a7-a5

Looking at the position, I notice White's king is quite active on c6. I should consider my king's safety and potential pawn advances.

Moving my king to g8 seems reasonable as it stays on the back rank while moving away from White's bishop on b8. This keeps my king safe while maintaining flexibility.

Now I can see my legal moves as Black. Let me analyze the position:

1. I have king moves: g8h8, g8f8, g8g7
2. I have pawn moves: h7h6, a7a6, f6f5, a7a5

Looking at the position, I notice that:
- White's king is on c3, quite far from my king
- White has bishops on b8 and f3
- I should be careful about potential checks from the bishop on f3

The most active move appears to be advancing my f-pawn with f6f5, which increases my space advantage on the kingside and could potentially create threats later. This move also doesn't expose my king to any immediate threats.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

I can see the current position and my legal moves. Let me analyze the situation:

1. My king is on g8 with three possible moves (g8h8, g8f8, g8g7)
2. I have pawns on c7, f7, h7, and f5
3. White has a king on c6, bishops on a8 and f6, and pawns on a6 and h5
4. White's bishop on f6 is controlling important diagonals

Looking at my options:
- Moving the king to h8 (g8h8) seems passive
- Moving the king to f8 (g8f8) could be risky with the white bishop on f6
- Moving the king to g7 (g8g7) would put me in check from the bishop on f6
- Moving the pawn h7-h6 weakens my king's position
- Moving the pawn f7-f6 would capture the white bishop, which seems strong
- Moving the pawn f5-f4 advances a passed pawn but doesn't address immediate threats

The best move appears to be capturing the bishop with my pawn:

Now I understand the position. As Black, I have the following situation:
- My king is on g8 with moves to h8, f8, g7, and f7
- I have pawns on c7, f5, h7, and f6
- White has a king on c6, bishops on b8 and f3, and a pawn on h4

Looking at the position critically:
1. My king is relatively safe for now
2. The f5 pawn can advance to f4
3. The h7 pawn can move to h6

The most active move appears to be advancing the f5 pawn to f4, which gains space and could potentially become a passed pawn later. This is a typical endgame strategy - activate pawns when possible.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

I need to analyze this position carefully as Black.

Current assessment:
- I have my king on g8 with a pawn on h7
- I have pawns on f6 and f4
- White has the king on c3, two bishops (on c7 and f5), and pawns on a5 and h4

The most pressing concern is protecting my king. The bishop on c7 is currently attacking the h2 square, but not directly threatening me. The bishop on f5 is controlling important squares but not directly attacking my king either.

Looking at my options:
1. King moves (g8h8, g8f8, g8g7, g8f7) - need to choose the safest square
2. Pawn moves (h7h6, f6f5) - advancing pawns could create space or block threats

The move f6f5 would attack White's bishop on f5, forcing it to move. This seems like a good active move that improves my position.

Let me check what legal moves I have available.

Now I understand my available moves. I have 5 legal moves:

1. g8h8 - Moving my king to the corner
2. g8f8 - Moving my king left
3. g8g7 - Moving my king down
4. g8f7 - Moving my king diagonally down-left
5. h7h6 - Advancing my h-pawn

Looking at the position, I need to be careful. White has two bishops which are powerful in open positions. My king is currently safe, but I should consider my best option.

The h7-pawn is protected by my king, and advancing it to h6 would maintain that protection while gaining space. This seems like a solid move that improves my position without risking anything.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

I need to analyze this position carefully. 

I'm playing as Black with my king on g8. White has a king on c7 and two bishops on b7 and g5. There are some pawns on the board, with White having pawns on a6 and h4, while I have pawns on h6, f5, and f4.

Looking at my legal moves:
- King moves: g8h8, g8f8, g8h7, g8g7, g8f7
- Pawn moves: f5g4, f4f3

The most pressing concern is my king's safety. The white bishop on g5 is attacking my king's diagonal, though not directly checking me. I need to ensure I don't walk into a check.

The move f5g4 would capture something (likely a white pawn), but I need to make sure it doesn't expose my king to danger.

The move f4f3 advances my pawn, which could be useful for creating a passed pawn later.

Among the king moves, moving to h8 seems safest as it gets away from the bishop's diagonal. Moving to f8 could be risky if the bishop on b7 can then check me.

After careful consideration, I'll move my king to h8.

I see my legal moves now. Let me analyze the position:

I'm playing as Black with my king on h8. White has a king on c7, bishops on b7 and d1, and pawns on a5 and h4. I have pawns on f4, f5, and h5.

Looking at my options:
- I can move my king to g8, h7, or g7
- I can advance my f-pawn from f4 to f3

The most critical factor here is king safety. Moving to g7 would put me in check from the bishop on b7, so that's illegal (and shouldn't be in the legal moves list, but I'll avoid it anyway).

Between the remaining king moves, h7 seems slightly better than g8 as it gives me more space and flexibility for future moves. The f4-f3 pawn move doesn't seem to accomplish much immediately.

I'll move my king to h7.

Looking at the position, I need to make a careful decision. I notice there's a discrepancy between the board display and the legal moves - the board shows my king on g8, but the moves suggest it's on h7.

Based on the legal moves, I'll assume my king is on h7. I should avoid moving my king to g7 as that would put it in check from White's bishop on e5. Moving the f4 pawn forward to f3 seems reasonable as it advances my passer without immediate drawbacks.

You are a professional chess player and you play as black. Now is your turn to make a move. Before making a move you can pick one of the following actions:
- 'get_current_board' to get the schema and current status of the board
- 'get_legal_moves' to get a UCI formatted list of available moves
- 'make_move <UCI formatted move>' when you are ready to complete your turn (e.g., 'make_move e2e4')

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

I see my legal moves. Let me analyze the position:

I'm playing as Black with my king on g8 and pawns on h7, f5, and f3. White has a king on c6, bishops on e5 and e6, and pawns on a5 and h4.

Looking at my options:
- King moves: h7h8, h7g8, h7g7 (moving my king from h7)
- Pawn moves: f3e2 (capture?), f5f4, f3f2

The most critical assessment is that my king is currently in check from the bishop on e5, which is attacking along the e5-h8 diagonal. I must address this check immediately.

My best move is to move my king to g7, which gets out of check and maintains a safer position.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Thank you for providing the legal moves. Let me analyze the position:

I have several options as Black:
- King moves: g7h8, g7g8, g7f8, g7h7, g7f7, g7f6
- Pawn moves: f5f4, f3f2, f3e2

Looking at the position critically:
1. My f3 pawn is about to promote, which is a significant advantage
2. White has two bishops but they're not immediately threatening my king
3. The f5 pawn provides some space control

The most decisive move is to advance my f3 pawn to f2, which will force White to deal with the promotion threat. This is clearly my strongest option.

Looking at my legal moves, I notice my pawn on f2 can promote immediately. This is clearly my strongest option as it gives me a significant material advantage. I'll promote to a queen, which is almost always the best choice.

2. White has a king on d4, bishops on b4 and f5
3. There are pawns on h6, f4 (Black's pawns) and h4, a5 (White's pawns)
4. My queen on f1 has many available moves

This appears to be an endgame position where I need to be careful about my king's safety while trying to use my queen effectively.

I'll move my queen to c4, which puts pressure on White's position and creates a potential threat against the white king:
