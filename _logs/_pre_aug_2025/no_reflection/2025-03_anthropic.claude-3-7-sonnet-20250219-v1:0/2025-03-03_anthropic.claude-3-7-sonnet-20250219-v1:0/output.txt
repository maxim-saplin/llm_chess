You are a professional chess player and you play as black. Now is your turn to make a move. Before making a move you can pick one of the following actions:
- 'get_current_board' to get the schema and current status of the board
- 'get_legal_moves' to get a UCI formatted list of available moves
- 'make_move <UCI formatted move>' when you are ready to complete your turn (e.g., 'make_move e2e4')

I see that White has made the first move, playing h2-h3 (moving the h-pawn one square forward). Now it's my turn as Black.

Let me check my legal moves.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Now I can see all my legal moves. Since White has played h2-h3, which is a somewhat passive move, I'll respond with a strong central pawn move.

I'll play e7-e5, which:
1. Stakes a claim in the center
2. Opens lines for my bishop and queen
3. Follows classical opening principles

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

I'll analyze the position and make a strategic move as Black.

White has played a standard d4 opening and also h3 (likely to prevent ...Bg4 pinning the knight). As Black, I have several good options:

1. I could play a standard response to d4 like ...d5 (Queen's Gambit) or ...Nf6 (Indian Defense)
2. I could challenge the center with ...e4 or capture with ...exd4
3. I could develop a piece like ...Nf6 or ...Nc6

The most principled response here is to develop a knight to f6, which controls the center, prepares for kingside castling, and follows opening principles of development.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Looking at the position and available moves, I need to make a strategic decision as Black.

The position is in the early opening phase. White has played d4 and h3, while I've developed my knight to f6 and pushed my e-pawn to e5. 

I have several good options:
1. Develop my other knight with Nc6 (b8c6)
2. Capture White's d-pawn with exd4 (e5d4)
3. Develop my dark-squared bishop with Be7 (f8e7)
4. Play d6 to support my e5 pawn (d7d6)

Among these, developing my knight to c6 is a solid classical approach that follows opening principles - develop pieces toward the center and control key squares. This move supports my e5 pawn and prepares for further development.

Now I have a clear picture of the position and my available moves. Let me analyze the situation:

1. White has played d4, challenging my central e5 pawn.
2. I have knights developed to c6 and f6, but need to continue development.
3. My bishops and rooks are still undeveloped.

I should focus on development and central control. One of the best moves here would be to develop my dark-squared bishop to e7, which protects my e5 pawn and allows me to castle soon.

I can see the board and my legal moves. I notice I have the option to castle kingside with "e8g8". This is an excellent move as it brings my king to safety and connects my rooks.

Castling is a priority in the middlegame, especially when the center is somewhat open. My king is currently in the center where it could become vulnerable, and castling will improve my rook's position on the h-file as well.

- I have bishops on c8 and e7
- White has advanced pawns on b4 and d4
- I have a pawn on e5 that could capture White's d4 pawn

Taking the d4 pawn with my e5 pawn looks like a good move as it would gain material and improve my central control. This would also open the e-file for my rook after I move my bishop.

You are a professional chess player and you play as black. Now is your turn to make a move. Before making a move you can pick one of the following actions:
- 'get_current_board' to get the schema and current status of the board
- 'get_legal_moves' to get a UCI formatted list of available moves
- 'make_move <UCI formatted move>' when you are ready to complete your turn (e.g., 'make_move e2e4')

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

I need to analyze the position carefully before making my move.

Looking at the board, I notice:
- I'm playing as Black and have a standard piece setup with knights on c6 and f6
- My king is on g8 with a rook on f8 and a8
- White has pushed a pawn to h6, creating a potential weakness
- I have a bishop on e7 that could develop actively
- My d-pawn has advanced to d4, putting pressure in the center

Among my options, I should consider:
1. Developing my light-squared bishop (currently on c8)
2. Centralizing my knights
3. Addressing the center pawn structure
4. Castling if not already done

The move e7c5 looks particularly strong, developing my bishop to an active diagonal where it targets White's queenside. This bishop will exert pressure on White's position and improve my piece coordination.

I notice my king is still in the center (on e8), so castling kingside with "f8g8" followed by "h8g8" would be a good priority to improve king safety. I also have two bishops and two knights developed.

Looking at the pawn structure, I see White has a pawn on c4, and I have a bishop on c5 that's well placed. My d-pawn has advanced to d4, putting pressure in the center.

I'll castle kingside to improve my king's safety:

After analyzing the position, I see I'm playing as Black with a fairly developed position. I notice my bishop on d4 is active and can make several strong moves.

One of the best options is to play Bd4xf2+, which would fork the White king and rook, winning material. This is a tactical opportunity I shouldn't miss.

After analyzing the position and my available moves, I notice I have a bishop on f2 that's deep in White's territory. This is a strong piece that I should consider using effectively.

Looking at the position, I see that my bishop on f2 can move to e1, potentially threatening White's queen or creating tactical opportunities. This move maintains pressure while staying active in White's territory.

- I'm playing as Black and have castled kingside
- White has advanced pawns on e5 and f5, g5
- I have knights on c6 and f6 that could be developed
- My queen is on d8 and could be activated

One of the strongest moves here would be to develop my knight from f6 to e4, which would:
- Attack the center
- Position my knight on a strong outpost
- Prepare for counterplay in the center

2. My king is on g8 with a rook on f8
3. White has a pawn on f5, which is somewhat advanced

I'll play a solid developing move that improves my position:

make_move f8e8

This move develops my rook to a central file, connects my rooks, and prepares for potential central play. It's a flexible move that maintains my options while improving my piece coordination.

- White's queen is on d4, putting pressure on my position
- I have knights on c6 and f6 that could develop further
- There's a pawn on a4 that could be threatening something

Looking at the legal moves, I have several good options:
1. I could castle kingside with g8h8
2. I could develop my knight with f6e4 or c6e5
3. I could advance pawns to control more space

The most principled move here is to castle and secure my king's safety, which is a priority in the opening/early middlegame.

I notice that I can castle kingside with e8g8 (O-O), which would improve my king's safety and connect my rooks. This is typically a strong move in the middlegame.

I also have various knight moves available, but I should prioritize king safety and development.

Given the current position, castling kingside appears to be the best move as it:
1. Improves king safety
2. Connects my rooks
3. Follows good chess principles for the middlegame

You are a professional chess player and you play as black. Now is your turn to make a move. Before making a move you can pick one of the following actions:
- 'get_current_board' to get the schema and current status of the board
- 'get_legal_moves' to get a UCI formatted list of available moves
- 'make_move <UCI formatted move>' when you are ready to complete your turn (e.g., 'make_move e2e4')

I need to analyze this position carefully. 

Looking at the board, I notice:
- White has a queen on d3 and has developed some pieces
- My king is on g8 without castling
- I have knights on c6 and f6, and my queen on d8
- The pawn structure is relatively intact

I need to prioritize king safety and piece development. I see that I can castle by moving my king from g8 to e8 or f8, which would be a good defensive move.

Among my options, castling queenside with:

After analyzing the position, I see I have several options as Black. I notice I can castle kingside with e8g8 (O-O), which would improve my king safety and connect my rooks.

The position appears to be in the middle game with some pieces already exchanged. My king is currently in the center, which is typically unsafe, and castling would address this vulnerability while activating my rook.

I'll castle kingside:

Now I have a clear picture of the position and my available moves. Let me analyze the situation:

1. I'm playing as Black and my king is on g8
2. White has a queen on c3 which is quite active
3. I have two knights (c6 and f6) that could be developed
4. My king's position seems somewhat exposed with the white queen on c3

Looking at the position, I should prioritize king safety and development. The move e8 is open, which would allow me to castle queenside by moving my king to e8 and then potentially to c8.

I'll move my king to e8, which improves my king's position and maintains the option to castle queenside later.

3. Develops my rook to a more active position on f8

Castling is a priority in the opening/early middlegame when it's available and safe, so I'll make this move.

1. I'm playing as Black and my king is on g8
2. White's queen is on b2, creating pressure on my queenside
3. I have two knights (c6 and f6) that could be developed
4. My bishop on c8 is undeveloped
5. My queen is on d8 and could be activated

Looking at the legal moves, I should prioritize king safety and piece development. The move Kf8 (g8f8) looks good as it moves my king away from the open g-file and prepares to connect my rooks.

You are a professional chess player and you play as black. Now is your turn to make a move. Before making a move you can pick one of the following actions:
- 'get_current_board' to get the schema and current status of the board
- 'get_legal_moves' to get a UCI formatted list of available moves
- 'make_move <UCI formatted move>' when you are ready to complete your turn (e.g., 'make_move e2e4')

After analyzing the position, I see that White's queen on b7 is threatening my position. I need to address this immediate threat.

I notice I can capture the queen with my bishop: c8b7. This is clearly the best move as it eliminates White's most powerful piece.

After analyzing the position, I see I'm playing as Black with a fairly developed position. I have both knights developed, my king is castled, and I have my queen and bishop active.

Looking at the legal moves, I notice I can improve my position by developing my knight to a more active square. The knight on c6 can move to e5, which would be a strong central outpost and put pressure on White's position.

The position appears to be in the middle game with both sides having developed pieces. As Black, I notice:
- My king is on h8 with a rook on f8
- I have knights on e5 and f6, and a bishop on b7
- White has a knight on d4 that's centralized

I'll play a solid move that improves my position by completing kingside castling (which appears to be in progress):

Let me analyze the position:

I'm playing as Black and I notice several interesting features:
- My king is on h8 with a rook on f8, suggesting I could castle kingside (h8g8 or f8g8)
- I have two knights (e5 and f6) that have active positions
- My bishop on c6 is also well-placed
- White has a rook on a4 that could be threatening my queenside

Looking at my options, I see a few strong candidate moves:
1. Castling with h8g8 or f8g8 would improve my king safety
2. Knight moves like e5c4 or f6d5 could increase my piece activity
3. d7d5 would stake a claim in the center

After consideration, I believe castling is a priority for king safety.

- My queen is on d8
- White has a rook on a4 that could be threatening my a-pawn
- I have castling options available

Looking at the legal moves, I have several strong candidates:
1. Castling with g8f8 or g8e8 would improve my king safety
2. Knight moves like e5g4 or f6e4 could increase pressure in the center
3. d7d5 would stake a claim in the center

After consideration, I'll castle kingside which is a priority for king safety.

After analyzing the position and my legal moves, I see several key considerations:

1. My king is on h8 with potential to castle queenside
2. I have knights on e5 and f6 in active positions
3. I have a bishop on c6 that could develop further
4. White has a bishop on b3 and knights on e5 and f2

Looking at the most promising moves:
- Castling with Kg8 (h8g8) would improve my king safety
- Knight moves like Nf6-d5 could control central squares
- The bishop on c6 has several good options

I'll choose to castle kingside, which is a priority for king safety.

Looking at the position, I need to make a strategic decision as Black. I notice several key features:

1. I have two knights well-positioned in the center (e5 and f6)
2. My dark-squared bishop is active on c6
3. White has a knight on e5 that could be threatening
4. My king's position seems relatively safe

One strong move would be to develop my rook on f8 to e8, connecting my rooks and controlling the e-file. This is a standard strategic move that improves my piece coordination.

Looking at the position, I notice my knight on e5 is particularly well-placed and could make a strong move to f3, creating a fork threat against the white king on e1 and potentially another piece.

1. My king is on g8 with rooks on a8 and e8
2. I have knights on f3 and f6, with the f3 knight being particularly active
3. I have a bishop on c6
4. White has some pieces developed, including knights on e5 and f6

I should focus on improving my position and possibly exploiting White's king position on f2.

The knight on f3 is particularly strong and can make some threatening moves. I'll use it to increase pressure on White's position.

One strong move would be to develop my knight on f6 to a more active square while putting pressure on White's position. The move Nf6-d5 looks particularly strong as it attacks the center and puts pressure on White's pieces.

After analyzing the position and legal moves, I see several interesting options. I notice my king is on g8, I have two knights (on d4 and d5), a bishop on c6, and my queen on h4. White's king is on f2 with limited protection.

I'll play a strong move that increases pressure on White's position:

Player_Black (to Proxy):

After analyzing the position and the legal moves, I see several strong options. I notice my queen is on h4, and I have knights on f4 and bishops on c6. The white king is on f2, which could be vulnerable.

One of the strongest moves I see is to attack with my knight:

make_move f4g2

This move attacks the white king directly with my knight, creating a strong threat. If the king moves, I can potentially capture material. If the knight is captured, it opens lines for my queen and bishop to continue the attack. This creates immediate pressure and forces White to respond defensively.

I notice my knight on g2 is attacking White's pieces and is in a strong position. My bishop on c6 is also active. My king's position seems secure for now.

Looking at the legal moves, I think developing my rook on a8 to a more active position would be beneficial. Moving it to c8 connects my rooks and puts pressure on the c-file.

Looking at the legal moves, I notice my knight on g2 is well-positioned and can potentially threaten White's king on f6. I should consider either improving my piece coordination or creating direct threats.

The move g2e3+ looks particularly strong as it gives a check to the White king while also attacking the White bishop on a7. This forces the White king to move and gives me a tempo to potentially capture that bishop next move.

The position shows I have a knight on e3, rooks on c8 and e8, and my king on g8. White has a bishop on c3, a rook on c1, a knight on f1, and the king on f2.

Looking at my legal moves, I notice my knight on e3 is well-positioned and can attack several squares. One particularly strong move would be to capture White's bishop with my knight.

I don't see a bishop directly in the legal moves list, but the knight on e3 can move to c2, which might be a capture. Let me check the board again - yes, there's a white bishop on c3, and my knight on e3 can capture it by moving to c2 (knight moves in an L-shape).

This would win material and improve my position, so I'll make this move.

Looking at the position, I need to make a strategic decision as Black. I notice:

1. I have a knight on c2 that's actively placed in White's territory
2. My king is on g8 with rooks on c8 and e8
3. White has a rook on c1 and a bishop on b2

One of my strongest moves appears to be using my knight on c2 to fork White's king on f2 and rook on e1. This would be a powerful tactical shot.

After analyzing the position, I see I'm playing as Black with my king on g8 and rooks on c8 and e8. White has a dangerous position with a rook on c1 and a knight on e1 that could potentially deliver a check.

I notice my e8 rook is under attack by White's bishop on b5. I should address this threat immediately. I also see that I can potentially create some counterplay with my knight on e1.

Looking at my options, I'll move my rook from e8 to e2, which both saves the rook from capture and creates a threat on the second rank, potentially targeting White's position.

I notice my rook on g2 is very active and can potentially deliver a check or control important squares. My knight on e1 can also become active with the right move.

Looking at my options, I'll play a strong move with my rook:

make_move g2g6

This move attacks White's king directly with check, forcing a response. It also protects my pawn on f7 and controls the 6th rank. This is a powerful active move that puts immediate pressure on my opponent.

White has:

- Several pawns (a7, a6, c4, h6)

This is an interesting middlegame/endgame position. Let me check what legal moves I have available.

Thank you for providing the legal moves. Let me analyze the position and make a decision.

Key observations:
1. My knight on g2 is attacking White's position and has several good options
2. My rook on g6 is active and could potentially create threats
3. White's king is somewhat exposed on d4

After evaluating the options, I see that my knight on g2 has a strong move to e3, which would fork White's king and rook. This is a tactical opportunity I should capitalize on.

You are a professional chess player and you play as black. Now is your turn to make a move. Before making a move you can pick one of the following actions:
- 'get_current_board' to get the schema and current status of the board
- 'get_legal_moves' to get a UCI formatted list of available moves
- 'make_move <UCI formatted move>' when you are ready to complete your turn (e.g., 'make_move e2e4')

After analyzing the position, I can see I'm playing as Black with my king on g8. I have a rook on g6, a knight on f5, and several pawns. White has a bishop on c8, a king on c3, a rook on c1, and a knight on f1.

I need to make a strong move. My knight on f5 is well-positioned, and my rook on g6 is active. Looking at the legal moves, I should consider king safety and piece activity.

The move g8h8 would put my king in the corner, which is generally safer. This would also free up the g8-a2 diagonal in case I need to develop pieces there later.

I'm playing as Black and have a rook on g6, a knight on f5, and my king on h8. White has a king on c3, knights on a8 and f1, a bishop on c8, and a rook on c1.

Looking at the material and position, I notice:
- I have a knight on f5 that's well-positioned and can make several moves
- My rook on g6 is active and controls the g-file
- My king on h8 can move to g8

The best move appears to be to improve my king's safety by moving it away from the edge:

- White has a king on d3, knights on a8 and f1, a bishop on c8, and a rook on c1
- Material is roughly even, but I need to be careful about my king's safety

Among my legal moves:
- Knight moves (f5) could be useful to attack or defend
- I should consider king safety with potential moves like g8h8 or g8f8
- Pawn advances could help create space or threats

After evaluation, I'll make a move with my knight on f5, which appears to be my most active piece:

Looking at the available moves, I'll play my knight to c3, which attacks White's king on d3. This creates a direct threat and forces White to respond.

1. Attacks White's rook on e5
2. Creates a fork between the rook and White's king on d3
3. Puts pressure on the center

This knight fork would win material by capturing the rook on the next move.

You are a professional chess player and you play as black. Now is your turn to make a move. Before making a move you can pick one of the following actions:
- 'get_current_board' to get the schema and current status of the board
- 'get_legal_moves' to get a UCI formatted list of available moves
- 'make_move <UCI formatted move>' when you are ready to complete your turn (e.g., 'make_move e2e4')

Now I can see all my legal moves. Since I'm playing as Black, I should focus on developing my pieces and controlling the center.

Looking at the position, I notice that White has played c3 and e3, setting up for d4 potentially. I should respond by establishing control in the center and developing my pieces.

One of the strongest moves here would be to develop my knight to c6, which helps control the center squares d4 and e5.

I can see the current position. White has developed their light-squared bishop to c4, which is putting pressure on the f7 square. They also have a knight on a3 and have played c3 and e3. As Black, I have knights on c6 and f6, and have pushed my e-pawn to e5.

Let me check what legal moves I have available.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Thank you for providing the legal moves. Let me analyze the position and make a good move.

Looking at the position, I need to continue my development and address White's bishop on c4 which is targeting my f7 square. I have several good developing options:

1. Developing my light-squared bishop with `f8e7` would be solid
2. Developing my dark-squared bishop with `c8d7` (but this isn't in the legal moves list)
3. Castling with `h8g8` (which is kingside castling in this notation)
4. Protecting the f7 square with `d8e7`

Since White's bishop is targeting f7, and I want to continue development while addressing this threat, I'll develop my light-squared bishop to e7, which both develops a piece and protects the f7 square.

I see all my legal moves now. Looking at the position, I notice I have the opportunity to castle kingside with e8g8 (O-O), which is generally a good idea to get my king to safety. This also connects my rooks.

The position looks like we're in a standard opening position where castling is appropriate - my king is still in the center, I've developed my knights and bishop, and the kingside is clear for castling.

- My king is on g8 with a rook on f8
- I have knights on c6 and f6, and bishops on c8 and e7
- White has developed some pieces but hasn't castled yet

Among my options, I should prioritize development and king safety. The move e7d6 (moving my bishop to d6) looks strong as it:
1. Develops my bishop to an active diagonal
2. Prepares for castling
3. Controls important central squares

Looking at my legal moves, I need to address this threat while continuing my development. The knight on c6 is pinned to my queen by White's bishop on c4, so moving it would expose my queen.

One strong move would be to develop my bishop with d6e7, which develops a piece, protects the f8 square, and prepares for castling. This is a natural developing move that improves my position.

I'll play a solid developing move by castling kingside, which completes my king's safety and connects my rooks.

After analyzing the position, I see that White's queen on a4 is threatening my position. I need to respond to this threat while continuing my development.

I notice that my knight on c6 can move to d4, which would attack White's queen and also put pressure in the center. This is a strong developing move that forces White to respond.

After analyzing the position and available moves, I see several key factors:

1. I have two knights - one on f6 and one on d4, with the d4 knight being particularly active
2. My king is on g8 with potential castling options
3. White has a bishop on c3 that's controlling some key diagonals

Looking at my options, I notice the knight on d4 has several strong moves. In particular, the move d4e6 stands out as it:
- Attacks White's queen on c7
- Creates a fork between the queen and possibly other pieces
- Improves my knight's position to a central square

This knight fork should win material or create significant tactical pressure.

4. White has a queen on c2 and has developed some pieces

Looking at my options, I should continue development. I notice my king is still in the center and I haven't castled yet. Castling kingside would be a good move to improve my king's safety.

- White has a queen on c2 and bishops on e5 and c1

Among my options, I see several good candidates:
- Castling with g8f8 or g8e8 would improve king safety
- Knight moves like f6e4 could gain central control
- Pawn advances like e5e4 could claim space

After evaluation, I'll castle queenside to improve my king's safety.

The position appears to be in the middle game with both sides developed. My king is still in the center, so castling would be a priority. White has some activity with the queen on c2 and bishops on g4 and c1, but there's no immediate threat I can see.

I'll analyze the position as Black:

The position appears to be in the early middlegame. White has developed some pieces and has the queen on c2. I notice my king is on g8 without castling, and I have knights on e6 and f6, bishops on e7 and c8, and my queen on d8.

Looking at the legal moves, I should prioritize development and king safety. Since I haven't castled yet, and my king is already on g8, I should consider completing my development and connecting my rooks.

One strong move would be to develop my light-squared bishop with e6-c5, which would attack White's queen on c2 while developing a piece to an active diagonal.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

After analyzing the position and my available legal moves, I'll make a decision.

I notice that my king is on g8 and I have several important considerations:
1. My knight on c5 has good activity and could potentially fork pieces
2. My knight on f6 is well-placed, defending key central squares
3. I should consider improving my king's safety

One strong move would be to castle by hand (since I can't formally castle anymore) by moving my king to the f8 square, which would connect my rooks and improve my king safety.

I'll play a solid move that both defends my knight and develops my position:

This move:
- Protects my knight on c5 from the queen's attack
- Prepares to develop my bishop to b7 in a future move
- Maintains control of important central squares

Player_Black (to Proxy):

After analyzing the position, I see several critical issues:

1. White's queen on d7 is threatening my bishop on e7
2. My king is potentially vulnerable
3. I need to address the immediate threat

Among my legal moves, I have a few good options:

1. `f6d7` - Knight captures queen, which is the most direct response
2. `c5d7` - Knight captures queen, also a strong option
3. `c8d7` - Bishop captures queen

The best move is to capture the queen with one of my knights. Between the two knights, capturing with the f6 knight is better as it maintains my c5 knight's control of important central squares.

Looking at the board, I notice:
- White has a knight on h4 that's somewhat exposed
- My knight on e4 is active but could be vulnerable
- I have an undeveloped rook on a8 and bishop on c8
- My king hasn't castled yet

Among my options, I see several strong candidates:
1. g8h8 (castling kingside) - would secure my king's safety
2. e7f6 - developing the bishop to a good diagonal
3. e4f6 - moving the knight to a safer and still active square

Castling is a priority in the opening/early middlegame, so I'll castle kingside:

The position shows I have knights on d7 and e4, with the e4 knight being particularly active. I notice my opponent has a knight on h4 that could be threatening my position.

I think one of the strongest moves here is to develop my knight from d7 to f6, which would control important central squares, protect my e4 pawn, and prepare for kingside castling.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

After analyzing the position and available moves, I'll make my decision.

The position appears to be in the middle game with both sides having developed their pieces. I notice my knight on e4 is quite active, and I have a bishop pair. White has a knight on h4 that could potentially be a target.

Looking at my options, I think developing my kingside and improving my king safety is a priority. I'll castle kingside.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

After analyzing the position and available moves, I'll make my decision.

The position shows I'm playing Black with a fairly developed position. I notice my knight on e4 is quite active, and I have a bishop on e7 that could be developed. My king is still on g8, and I have several tactical opportunities.

Looking at the available moves, I see that my knight on e4 has several good options. It's currently attacking White's knight on f2, which is a strong outpost. I also notice my bishop on c8 could be developed to improve my position.

I'll develop my light-squared bishop with:

make_move c8e6

This move develops my bishop to a strong diagonal, controls important central squares, and improves my overall position. It also prepares for potential kingside castling completion by connecting my rooks.

One of my strongest moves appears to be developing my knight on e4 to c3, which would attack White's queen on d1 (though I can't see it on the board visualization, this is a common knight fork pattern). This would create a powerful threat.

After analyzing the position and available moves, I see I have a developed position with both bishops and knights active. I notice my e5 pawn is under pressure, and I have opportunities to improve my piece coordination.

I'll play the move e5e4, advancing my central pawn. This strengthens my position in the center, puts pressure on White's pawn structure, and opens more lines for my bishops.

After analyzing the position and available moves, I see I'm playing as Black in a complex middlegame position. I have several tactical opportunities to consider.

I notice my knights are well positioned, and I have two bishops aimed at the kingside. White's king appears to be on g2 with some exposed squares around it. I should look for attacking chances.

One strong move is to activate my dark-squared bishop with d6-f4, putting pressure on White's position and potentially setting up tactical threats.

After analyzing the position and available moves, I see several key factors:

1. My king is on g8 with the rook on f8, suggesting I haven't castled yet
2. I have two knights (on d5 and f6) and two bishops (on e6 and f4)
3. White has advanced pawns in the center and queenside

Looking at my options, I notice some strong tactical possibilities with my bishops and knights. The bishop on f4 is particularly active and could create threats.

I'll play a strong developing move that improves my piece coordination:

make_move f4e3

This move attacks White's pawn structure while maintaining my bishop on a strong diagonal. It increases pressure in the center and prepares for potential tactics against White's king position.

After analyzing the position and legal moves, I can see I'm playing as Black with a fairly developed position. I notice I have a bishop on e6 and g5, a knight on f6, and my king is on g8. 

Looking at the legal moves, I see several strong options:
- I could develop my queen with d8e7
- I could improve my bishop with e6f5
- I could advance my pawn with e4e3

The e4e3 pawn push looks particularly strong as it advances my passed pawn and threatens to promote. This would create a significant advantage.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

After analyzing the position and available moves, I'll make my decision.

The position appears to be in the middlegame with material roughly equal. I notice I have my queen on d8, rooks on c8 and e8, and my king on g8. I also have bishops on e6 and g5, and a knight on f6.

Looking at the available moves, I should prioritize improving my position. The knight on f6 has several good options, including g4 which attacks White's bishop on e5. My bishop on g5 also has some active possibilities.

I think one of the strongest moves here is to activate my knight with:

make_move f6g4

This move attacks White's bishop on e5 and increases my control of the center. If White moves the bishop, I'll have gained tempo, and if they defend it, I can continue developing my position.

After analyzing the position and available moves, I'll make my decision.

The position shows I have several active pieces - my queen on d8, two bishops (e6 and g5), and a knight on g4. I need to consider both my attacking opportunities and defensive needs.

Looking at the board, I notice my knight on g4 is well-positioned and could potentially attack White's kingside. My bishop on g5 is also active. I should consider coordinating these pieces for an attack.

One strong move would be to bring my queen into the attack with Qd8f6, creating pressure on White's kingside while maintaining connection with my other pieces.

- The knight on e5 can make several strong moves, particularly to g4 which would increase pressure on White's kingside
- The bishop on e6 has several good diagonal moves
- The queen on f6 can be repositioned to increase attacking pressure

I'll choose to move my knight from e5 to g4, increasing pressure on White's kingside and potentially setting up tactical threats.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Let me analyze the position:

I'm playing as Black and have a material advantage with two bishops, a knight, and a queen against White's two bishops and a knight. The position looks complex with both kings somewhat exposed.

Looking at my options:
- I have a powerful bishop on e6 controlling key diagonals
- My knight on g5 is active and could potentially create threats
- My queen on f6 is well-positioned and could coordinate with other pieces

One strong move I see is to improve my queen's position with `f6e5`, which:
1. Increases my queen's mobility and control of the center
2. Puts pressure on White's knight on c3
3. Maintains protection of my bishop on e6
4. Creates potential threats against White's king

This move strengthens my position without immediate risk.

After analyzing the position and available moves, I see I have several strong options. I notice my queen on e5 has multiple attacking possibilities, and my bishop on e6 is also well-positioned.

Looking at the position more carefully, I see that my knight on g4 is attacking the white bishop on d7. This is a valuable target. Additionally, my queen on e5 could potentially create threats.

I'll play a strong move with my queen:

make_move e5f4

This move puts pressure on White's position, attacks the f-pawn, and maintains control of key central squares. It also keeps my queen active while maintaining the threat on the bishop at d7 with my knight.

2. Threatens material (the g2 pawn if there was one)
3. Maintains control of the center
4. Keeps pressure on White's position

Player_Black (to Proxy):

I'll analyze the position and make a strong move.

Looking at the board, I notice several key features:
- I have two rooks on the back rank (c8 and e8)
- My queen is on g2, attacking along the g-file and the a8-h1 diagonal
- I have bishops on e6 and g5 in active positions
- White has a bishop on g4 that could be vulnerable

One of my strongest options appears to be using my queen to attack. The move g2h1 looks particularly strong as it attacks White's rook on h1 (though I don't see a rook there on the board visualization, so this might be targeting another piece or square).

Another strong option is g2a8, which would attack White's rook on a1.

Given the position, I'll make what appears to be the most aggressive and tactically sound move:

Player_Black (to Proxy):

After analyzing the position, I see I'm playing as Black with a material advantage. I have two rooks, a queen, and two bishops against White's two rooks, two bishops, and a knight.

My queen on e4 is very active and threatening. I notice my bishop on e6 is also well positioned. Looking at the legal moves, I can see several strong options.

I'll play a move that increases my queen's control while maintaining pressure on White's position:

make_move e4f3

This move:
1. Maintains my queen's central influence
2. Threatens White's kingside
3. Keeps pressure on White's position
4. Maintains my material advantage

The queen on f3 will be well positioned to coordinate with my other pieces for future attacks.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

After analyzing the position, I see several strong options as Black. I have a queen on f3 that's actively placed, bishops on e6 and g5, and rooks on c8 and e8.

The most pressing issue is that my king on g8 appears somewhat exposed. I notice I have a bishop on e6 that can capture the bishop on g4 (g5e3), which would eliminate a potential threat.

However, I think the most powerful move is to use my queen on f3 to attack. Looking at the position, I see White's king is on c3 with limited protection. My queen can deliver a strong check by moving to e2.

The white king is on c3 with limited protection, which presents tactical opportunities. My queen on e2 is already putting pressure on the position, and I notice my bishop on g5 is attacking the h4 pawn.

One of the strongest moves appears to be moving my queen to check the white king while maintaining control of the position:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

I need to analyze this position carefully. I'm playing as Black and have several pieces under attack and tactical opportunities to consider.

Key observations:
- My king is on g8 with rooks on c8 and e8
- I have a bishop on e6 and another on g5
- White has a bishop on e5 threatening my rook on c8
- White's bishop on g4 is also active

Looking at the legal moves, I see several strong options:
1. I could move my bishop e6xg4 to capture White's bishop, but that's not in the legal moves list
2. My bishop on g5 has several good squares
3. I could protect my c8 rook by moving it or defending it

The most active move appears to be g5e3, attacking White's king on d4 with my bishop. This puts immediate pressure on White and forces a response.

I notice my bishop on e3 can capture White's bishop on g4, which would be a good material gain. This move also puts pressure on White's position.

Looking at the position, I need to make a strong opening move as Black. Since White played a3, which is a somewhat passive move, I'll respond with a standard developing move.

The most principled responses would be either e7e5 (controlling the center) or d7d5 (controlling the center). I'll go with e5, which is a classical response that stakes a claim in the center and opens lines for my bishop and queen.

I can see that White has played an unusual opening with 1.a3 and 2.Nh3. As Black, I've played 1...e5. Now I need to see what legal moves I have available.

Looking at the position and available moves, I'll develop a piece and aim for a solid position. The knight development to f6 is a standard and strong move in this position, controlling the center and preparing for kingside castling.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

After analyzing the position and my legal moves, I notice that White's knight on g5 is threatening my pawn on e6. I should address this threat.

I have several good options:
1. h7h6 - Directly challenging the knight
2. f6g4 - Moving my knight to a more active position while also attacking White's kingside
3. f6d5 - Developing my knight to a central square

I'll choose to play h7h6, which directly challenges the knight on g5. This is a standard response to the knight attack, forcing the knight to either retreat or be captured.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Now I have a clear picture of the position and my available moves. 

I notice I have a knight on e4, which is a strong central outpost. I should continue developing my pieces and consider castling for king safety. The knight on e4 is well-placed, so I don't want to move it unless there's a tactical advantage.

Looking at my options, developing the knight at b8 to c6 would be a solid move, controlling central squares and preparing to castle. Another good option would be developing the dark-squared bishop to e7.

I'll develop my knight to c6, which supports my center, develops a piece, and prepares for castling.

I'll develop my bishop and strengthen my control of the center with:

make_move f8e7

This move:
1. Develops my light-squared bishop
2. Protects my e-pawn
3. Connects my rooks
4. Maintains flexibility for future castling
5. Prepares for potential kingside development

This is a solid developing move that improves my position without creating any weaknesses.

- White has a bishop on b7 which is attacking my rook on a8
- I have a knight on c6 and bishops on e7 and e5
- There's a pawn on f4 that could be advanced
- My kingside castling appears to be incomplete (rook on f8, king on g8)

Looking at the legal moves, I have several good options:
1. Complete castling with g8h8
2. Develop my knight with c6e5 or c6d4
3. Advance my f-pawn with f4f3
4. Protect my a8 rook that's under attack

I'll complete my kingside castling, which is a priority for king safety.

3. My king is on g8 with potential castling options
4. I have a pawn on f4 that has advanced

Looking at my legal moves, I notice I can castle kingside with "f8g8", which would improve my king safety and connect my rooks. This is typically a strong priority in the middlegame.

2. I have a bishop on e7 that has good mobility
3. My knight on c6 has several potential moves
4. White's queen is on d4, which could be threatening

Looking at my options, I want to improve my position and address any immediate threats. The knight on c6 has some good outposts, particularly e5 which would put pressure on White's position.

I'll play the knight to e5, which attacks White's queen and improves my piece positioning.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

After analyzing the position, I see several key features:
- I'm playing as Black
- White has a bishop on b2 that's attacking my knight on e5
- My knight on e5 is currently under attack
- I have a pawn on f4 that's advanced
- My king is on g8 with some pieces around for protection

I need to address the immediate threat to my knight on e5. I have several options:

1. Move the knight away (e5g6, e5c6, e5g4, e5c4, e5f3, e5d3)
2. Defend the knight with another piece
3. Make a counter-threat that's more significant

Among the knight moves, e5g4 looks strong as it attacks White's queen on d1. However, I notice that White's queen is actually on d4, not d1, so this wouldn't create a direct threat to the queen.

The move e5f3 looks promising as it creates a fork threat against White's king on e1 and rook on h1. This would be a strong tactical move.

After analyzing the position, I can see I'm playing as Black and have several good options. 

I notice my knight on f3 is active and can make several moves. I also see my bishop on e7 has mobility. The position appears to be in the middle game with my king castled kingside.

Looking at the board more carefully, I see that White has a bishop on b2 that's targeting my kingside, and a queen on d4. My knight on f3 is well-placed and putting pressure on White's position.

One of the strongest moves here would be to develop my knight on f3 to d4, where it would attack White's queen and potentially force it to move to a less active square.

2. My king is on g8 with potential safety issues
3. I have a knight on c6 and bishops on e7 and c8
4. There appears to be some tension in the center and kingside

Looking at my options, I should prioritize king safety and development. The move e7f8 (♝e7-f8) would improve my king's protection by bringing the bishop back to defend. However, this is somewhat passive.

I notice I can also play c6e5 (♞c6-e5), which develops my knight to a strong central square and puts pressure on White's queen.

After consideration, I'll choose to play the knight move to e5, which is both active and creates a threat.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

I need to analyze this position carefully as Black.

Key observations:
- White's queen is on f5, attacking my knight on e5 and pawn on f4
- My knight on e5 is defended by my bishop on e7
- White has a bishop on b2 controlling the long diagonal
- My king is on g8 with potential safety concerns

Looking at the legal moves, I need to address the immediate threat to my knight on e5 and consider counterplay.

The best move appears to be retreating the knight to c4, which maintains its activity and puts pressure on White's position while escaping the queen's attack.

Let me analyze the position and my available moves:

I notice several key aspects of the position:
- My king is on g8 with the rook on h8, so castling is not an option
- White's queen is on c3, putting pressure on my queenside
- I have a knight on c4 that has several good options
- White has a bishop on b2 that's controlling the long diagonal

Among my options, I see some strong candidate moves:
- Knight moves from c4, particularly to e3 which forks White's king and rook
- Bishop moves from e7, particularly to g5 which develops with tempo
- Pawn moves to strengthen my position

The knight fork on e3 looks particularly strong as it threatens both White's king on d1 and rook on a1.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Let me analyze the position as Black:

I notice my king is on g8 with the h-pawn moved, suggesting I've castled kingside. I have a knight on e3 that's quite active in White's territory. White has a queen on c3 and a bishop on b2 that could be threats.

Looking at my legal moves, I have several strong options:
- The knight on e3 has many potential moves, including tactical opportunities
- I could develop my pieces further with moves like Bf8 or Re8
- I could strengthen my pawn structure with moves like g6 or f6

The knight on e3 seems particularly well-placed and could potentially fork pieces. Let me choose a strong move with this knight:

Given the position, I want to improve my piece activity and ensure king safety. The knight on g4 is well-placed and applying pressure. My bishop on e7 could be more active.

I'll move my bishop to develop it to a more active square while maintaining defense of my kingside.

- I have two bishops (c5 and c8) and a knight on g4
- My king is on g8 and appears somewhat exposed
- White has a bishop on b7 that's controlling the a8-h1 diagonal

Looking at my options, I should prioritize king safety and development. The bishop on c5 is well-placed and active. The knight on g4 is also in a good attacking position.

One strong move is to develop my queen to e7, which would protect the c5 bishop, defend the g7 pawn, and prepare to castle queenside if needed.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

After analyzing the position and available moves, I can see that:

1. My king is on g8 and appears safe
2. White's queen is on e4, attacking along the e-file
3. I have a knight on e3 that's deep in White's territory
4. My queen is on e7

I notice my knight on e3 is in a strong position and can make several interesting moves. One particularly strong move is to capture White's bishop on f1 with a check: e3f1+

This would win material and give check to the White king simultaneously.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

I need to analyze the position carefully. 

I see that White's queen is on e4 attacking my e-pawn. My queen is on e7, and I have a knight on f1 that could potentially develop. The position looks somewhat tense with White having some attacking chances.

Looking at my options, I should prioritize safety for my king and development. The knight on f1 is already developed but in an unusual position. I notice my f-pawn is under attack by White's queen, and I should consider how to address that.

One solid move would be to defend the f7 pawn with my queen by playing e7f6, which also maintains control of important central squares.

Looking at the position more carefully, I see that White has a bishop on f2 and a queen on e5. My f-pawn has advanced to f4, which is putting some pressure on White's position.

One of the strongest moves I can make is to use my queen to attack White's e-pawn while maintaining control of important squares:

One strong move would be to develop my knight from f1 with tempo by attacking White's queen:

4. My bishop on d7 has some potential mobility

The knight on e4 looks particularly strong and could create threats. I'll use it to attack White's bishop on f2 while simultaneously threatening the king on e1.

You are a professional chess player and you play as black. Now is your turn to make a move. Before making a move you can pick one of the following actions:
- 'get_current_board' to get the schema and current status of the board
- 'get_legal_moves' to get a UCI formatted list of available moves
- 'make_move <UCI formatted move>' when you are ready to complete your turn (e.g., 'make_move e2e4')

Player_Black (to Proxy):

After analyzing the position and the available legal moves, I notice several important factors:

1. I'm playing as Black and have a queen on e6 and a bishop on d7
2. White has a queen on d3 (appears to be d3 based on the board visualization)
3. My king on g8 is somewhat exposed

Looking at my options, I want to improve my position while maintaining safety. One strong move would be to activate my queen with a threat.

make_move e6c4

This move:
- Attacks White's c-pawn
- Maintains control of key central squares
- Positions my queen more actively
- Prepares potential threats against White's queenside

After analyzing the position, I see that I'm playing as Black with a material advantage (I have a bishop and several pawns more than White). White has a rook on g7 that's infiltrated my position, but I have two rooks and a bishop for attacking.

I notice my king on g8 is somewhat exposed with White's rook on g7. I should address this threat while maintaining my material advantage.

One of the strongest moves here is to move my rook from c8 to c2, putting direct pressure on White's second rank and potentially threatening the king on e2. This creates immediate threats while developing my rook to an active position.

2. My bishop on d7 controls important diagonals
3. My king on g8 is relatively safe

One of the strongest moves appears to be `c2c1`, threatening to promote my rook to a queen on the next move. This would create an overwhelming material advantage.

I notice that:
- I'm playing as Black with my king on g8
- White has a rook on g6 that's attacking my g7 pawn
- I have a bishop on d7 and a rook on g8
- Material seems roughly equal, but I need to address the threat on g7

Looking at my legal moves, I should prioritize defending the g7 pawn or creating counterplay. Moving my king to h7 would be dangerous with White's rook on g6. 

The move f7-f5 looks strong as it:
1. Defends the g7 pawn
2. Challenges White's control of the center
3. Opens lines for my bishop on d7

Player_Black (to Proxy):

I need to carefully analyze this position. As Black, I see:

1. My king is on g8 with a rook on g8 (castled kingside)
2. White has a rook on g7 threatening my position
3. I have a bishop on d7 and pawns on a7, b7, h6, and f4
4. White has a rook on a1, knight on b1, and king on c1

The most urgent issue is the white rook on g7 which is threatening my position. I need to address this immediately.

Looking at my options:
- I could move my king to f8, but that doesn't solve the threat
- I could capture the rook with Kg7, but that seems risky
- I could move my bishop to protect against further threats

After evaluation, I believe the best move is to capture the threatening rook with my king.

Looking at the position, I need to make a strategic decision as Black. I notice I have a rook on g7, a bishop on d7, and my king on h8. The position appears to be in an endgame phase.

After analyzing the legal moves, I see several good options:
- I could move my king to g8 or h7
- I could move my rook on g7 to various squares
- I could develop my bishop on d7

The most active move appears to be to use my rook to control the g-file. Since I already have the rook on the 7th rank (which is typically strong), I'll use it to put pressure on White's position.

One of my strongest pieces is the rook on c2, which is already deep in White's territory. I can use this rook to create immediate threats or gain material.

The move c2c1+ stands out as particularly strong - it checks the White king and will likely win material since the king will have to move away from d1, allowing me to capture the rook on a1 next move.

My rook on c1 is particularly strong, controlling the c-file and threatening White's back rank. I should capitalize on this advantage.

The best move appears to be to attack White's king with my rook:

I notice my rook on d1 is attacking the open d-file, which is a strong position. I should consider either:
1. Moving the rook to d3 to attack White's king area
2. Developing my bishop to a better square
3. Advancing my pawns to create threats

The most active move appears to be using my rook to apply pressure on White's position.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Thank you for providing the legal moves. Let me analyze the position and make a strong move.

Looking at the position, I notice several key factors:
- My rook on d3 is very active and controls the d-file
- I have a bishop on d7 that could develop further
- My king is safe on g8
- My pawns on the queenside could potentially advance

Among my options, I see a few strong candidates:
1. Rook moves like d3c3 to attack White's king directly
2. Bishop moves to improve its position
3. Advancing my queenside pawns

The most immediate threat I can create is with my rook. Since White's king is on c4, moving my rook to c3 would put direct pressure on the king, forcing a response.

Looking at my options:
- I have a bishop on d7 that can move in several directions
- My king can move to g7, g8, or h7
- I have pawn advances available

The most active piece is my bishop, and I notice it can move to b5, which would attack White's king on c4. This would be a check and a strong move.

I can see the current board position. This appears to be an endgame position where I'm playing as Black with my king on g8, and I have pawns on a7, b7, h6, f4, and f5. White has a king on b4, a knight on c3, pawns on a3, b3, and h5, and a rook on a1.

Let me check what legal moves I have available.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Now I can see my legal moves. Let me analyze the position and make the best move:

1. King moves (h8g8, h8h7, h8g7): These are all safe king moves, but I should consider if any have strategic advantages.

2. Pawn moves (b7b6, a7a6, a7a5, f4f3): 
   - The f4f3 pawn advance could be valuable to create a passed pawn
   - The queenside pawn moves are less urgent

Looking at the position, advancing my f-pawn seems most promising as it creates a potential passed pawn and increases my space advantage on the kingside. The white king is far away on b4 and would take several moves to reach my kingside.

Now I understand my options. Let me analyze the position:

I'm playing as Black with my king on h8. White has a king on b4, a knight on c3, a rook on g1, and some pawns. I have pawns on a7, b7, h7, f3, and f5.

Looking at my legal moves:
- King moves: h8h7 (moving my king down one square)
- Pawn moves: b7b6, a7a6, a7a5, f5f4, f3f2

The most critical move appears to be advancing my f3 pawn to f2, which is just one step away from promotion. This is likely my strongest move as it threatens to promote to a queen next move, which would give me a decisive advantage.

3. Pawn promotion: f2f1q, f2f1r, f2f1b, f2f1n
4. Move f5f4 (though I don't see a pawn at f5 on the board, this might be a typo)

The most critical move here is clearly the pawn promotion on f2. I can promote to a queen, rook, bishop, or knight. Since the queen is the most powerful piece, and I don't see any immediate tactical reason to underpromote, I'll promote my f2 pawn to a queen.

Looking at my options, I notice my queen on f1 has many possible moves. This is a powerful piece that I should use effectively. Since the white king is on c3, I can consider moves that put pressure on White.

One strong move would be to check the white king with my queen by moving to c4:

I notice several strong options with my queen. The most decisive move appears to be:

make_move c4g8

This move checks the White king from c4 to g8, creating a powerful diagonal attack. This controls important squares and maintains pressure while keeping my queen safe. From g8, the queen maintains flexibility and can continue to restrict the White king's movement.

After analyzing the position and my legal moves, I see several strong options. The most critical aspects of this position are:

1. My queen on d5 is very active and can potentially create threats
2. White's king on e5 is somewhat exposed
3. I should consider both attacking opportunities and king safety

I'll play a strong move that puts pressure on White's position while maintaining control:

make_move d5e4

This move attacks White's king directly, forcing it to move and potentially creating tactical opportunities. It also maintains control of key squares and keeps my queen active in the center of the board.

After analyzing the position, I see I'm playing as Black with my king on h8, queen on e4, and pawns on a7, b7, h6, and f5. White has a king on f6, rook on b1, knight on c3, and pawns on a3, b4, and h4.

I notice several strong options:
1. I can check the White king with my queen (e4f3)
2. I can capture the h4 pawn with my queen (e4h4)
3. I can threaten the knight with my queen (e4c6)

The most decisive move appears to be checking the White king with e4f3, which puts immediate pressure on White and restricts their king's movement.

- 'get_legal_moves' to get a UCI formatted list of available moves
- 'make_move <UCI formatted move>' when you are ready to complete your turn (e.g., 'make_move e2e4')

After analyzing the position, I can see I'm playing as Black with my king on h8, a queen on f3, and pawns on a7, b7, h7, and f5. White has a king on f6, a knight on b4, a rook on b1, and pawns on a3, b2, and h4.

My queen on f3 is very active and has many possible moves. I notice that White's king is exposed on f6, and my queen can deliver a check.

The strongest move here is to check the White king with my queen:

make_move f3f6

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

I apologize for the error. Let me check the board again. It seems the move f3f6 is not legal, which means there must be a piece blocking the path or another issue.

Let me review the legal moves again and make a better decision.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

I see the issue now. Looking at the legal moves and the board position more carefully, I notice that my queen on f3 cannot directly check the king on f6 because the path is blocked.

Given the position, one of the strongest moves would be to attack White's knight with my queen while maintaining control of key squares:

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Looking at the position, I need to make a strategic decision as Black. 

I notice that:
- My king is on h8 with the white king on e5
- I have a queen on f6 which is very active
- There's a white rook on b1 and a white knight on a7
- Material is in my favor

The most powerful piece I have is my queen on f6. I should consider either:
1. Checking the white king
2. Capturing a piece
3. Improving my position

Looking at the legal moves, I see I can check the white king with Qf6-e6+, which would be a strong move. I can also potentially threaten the white rook with Qf6-b6.

I'll make the move:

1. I could check the White king with my queen (e6d5 or e6c4)
2. I could capture the undefended h4 pawn with my f5 pawn (f5f4)

3. I have pawns on b7, h7, and f5

Looking at my options:
- King moves: h8g8, h8h7, or h8g7
- Pawn moves: b7b6, b7b5, or f5f4

The most critical factor is king safety. Moving my king to g7 would put it in check from White's rook on e1, so that's not viable. Between g8 and h7, g8 keeps my king more centralized and away from the edge of the board, which is generally better.

The pawn move f5f4 advances my passed f-pawn, which could become a strong asset. The b-pawn moves are less urgent.

I'll move my king to g8, improving its position while maintaining safety.

I see the position now. I'm playing as Black with my king on g8, pawns on b7, h7, and f5, while White has a king on e8, a knight on c6, a rook on e1, and pawns on a5, b4, and h4.

Let me analyze my options:

1. King moves (g8h8, g8h7, g8g7): These are standard king moves, but none seem particularly urgent.
2. b7c6: This would capture White's knight, which is a significant material gain.
3. b7b6, b7b5: These are pawn advances, but not particularly impactful.
4. f5f4: This advances my f-pawn.

The most obvious strong move is to capture the knight on c6, which would give me a significant material advantage. This is clearly the best option.

I see the current position and my legal moves. Let me analyze the situation:

1. I'm playing as Black with my king on g8
2. White has a king on e8 and a rook on e5
3. There's a critical situation with White's rook on the e-file
4. I have pawns on c6, f5, and h7
5. White has pawns on a5, b4, and h4

My legal moves are:
- King moves: g8h8, g8h7, g8g7
- Pawn moves: c6c5, f5f4

The most pressing concern is White's rook on e5, which is controlling the e-file. Moving my king to h8 would be safest to avoid any potential checks along the g-file. The pawn move f5f4 would advance my passed pawn, which could become a valuable asset.

I'll choose to advance my f-pawn, creating a passed pawn that will require White's attention:

Player_Black (to Proxy):

I need to analyze this position carefully as Black.

Key observations:
- I'm playing as Black with my king on g8
- White has a rook on e5 and king on d4
- There's a dangerous situation with White's rook on the 5th rank
- I have pawns on c6, f4, and h6

Looking at my options:
1. King moves (g8h8, g8f8, g8h7, g8g7, g8f7) - need to consider safety
2. Pawn moves (c6c5, f4f3) - need to consider if these advance my position

The rook on e5 is controlling the e-file and 5th rank. If I move my king to f8, it would be in check from the rook. Moving to g7 might expose my king to future checks.

The safest king move appears to be h8, while advancing my f-pawn to f3 makes progress toward promotion.

I'll make my move:

I see the current position and my legal moves. Let me analyze the situation:

1. I'm playing as Black with my king on g8
2. White has a king on d8 and a rook on e6
3. There's a critical white rook on e6 that's creating threats
4. I have pawns on c6, f3, h6, and h4

Looking at my options:
- Moving my king (g8h8, g8f8, g8h7, g8g7, g8f7)
- Moving my c6 pawn (c6b5, c6c5)
- Advancing my f3 pawn (f3f2)

The f3 pawn is quite advanced and pushing it to f2 would create a strong passed pawn that's close to promotion. This is likely my strongest move as it creates a serious promotion threat that White will need to address.

Looking at the legal moves, I notice my queen on f1 has many options. The most pressing concern is that White's rook on e5 is attacking my c-pawn on c6, and I need to decide whether to defend it or pursue other plans.

Since my queen is very active on f1 and White's king is on c3, I can consider a check that might help me gain tempo or create threats. The move f1c4 would check the white king while also attacking the b-pawn.

I'm playing as Black with my king on g8. White has a king on c8 and a rook on e8. I have a queen on c5, and there are various pawns on the board.

Looking at my legal moves:
- g8h7: Moving my king to h7
- g8g7: Moving my king to g7
- g8f7: Moving my king to f7

The white rook on e8 is controlling the e-file, so I need to be careful. Moving to f7 would put me closer to the white king and rook, which seems risky. Moving to h7 is a reasonable option, but g7 keeps me more centralized while still getting out of the back rank.

I'll choose to move my king to g7.

I need to analyze this position carefully. I'm playing as Black and I see:

- My king is on g7
- My queen is on c4
- I have pawns on c6 and h7
- White has a king on c3, a rook on h8, and pawns on a5, b4, and h4

Looking at the legal moves, I notice I have a powerful queen on c4 with many options. The most critical observation is that I can deliver checkmate immediately with:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

I need to analyze this position carefully. I'm playing as Black, and I see:

1. My king is on g7 with White's rook on h8 - this is a dangerous situation
2. My queen is on g8, which is protecting my king from the rook
3. White's king is on d4
4. I have a pawn on c6 and h7

Looking at the legal moves, I need to prioritize safety and potentially look for checkmate opportunities.

The most critical decision is what to do with my queen on g8. I could:
- Keep protecting the king by staying on the g-file
- Try to deliver check to White's king
- Capture the rook on h8

Since the rook on h8 is threatening my king, and my queen can capture it safely, that's the best move.

Now I can see the board position. I'm playing as Black with my king on g7 and pawns on c6, h6, and h4. White has a king on c3 and pawns on a4, b4, and h4.

Let me check what legal moves I have available.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Now I can see my legal moves. Let me analyze the position:

I have my king on g7 with several possible moves, and I can also move my c6 pawn to either b5 or c5.

Looking at the position, I notice:
- The position is quite simplified with just kings and pawns
- My c6 pawn has potential to advance and possibly promote
- Moving my c-pawn forward seems most productive to create a passed pawn

I'll advance my c-pawn one square forward:

1. I'm playing as Black with my king on g7 and pawns on c5 and h7
2. White has a king on d2 and pawns on a4, b4, and h4

Let me analyze the position:
- My king is currently protecting my h7 pawn
- I have a passed c-pawn that could potentially advance
- White's king is far from my c-pawn

The most promising plan is to advance my c-pawn while keeping my king near my h-pawn. Let's push the c-pawn forward.

Now I understand my options. I need to make a strategic decision as Black.

Looking at the position:
1. My king can move in several directions (g7→h8/g8/f8/h7/f7/f6)
2. My c-pawn can advance to c3

Analyzing the position:
- The c-pawn is my most advanced pawn and could potentially promote
- White's pawns on the queenside (a4, b4) are connected and could advance
- My h6 pawn is blocked by White's h4 pawn

The best strategy is to advance my c-pawn while it's free to move, as this creates a passed pawn that could become a significant threat.

Looking at the position, my c-pawn is much more advanced than any of White's pawns, so pushing it forward is my best winning chance. Moving my king would just waste time when I have this clear advantage.

- The white king on f2 would be in check
- The king can't move to e1, e2, e3, f1, f3, g1, g2, or g3 as these squares are either attacked by my queen or outside the board
- There are no pieces that can block the check or capture my queen

Now I can see my legal moves. Let me analyze the position:

I have my king on g7 and can move to h8, g8, f8, h7, f7, or f6. I also have a pawn on h7 that's close to promotion.

The key strategic considerations are:
1. Advancing my h-pawn to promote to a queen
2. Using my king to support the pawn's advance
3. Preventing White's king from stopping my pawn

Since my h7 pawn is only one square away from promotion, my priority should be to support it while keeping White's king away. Moving my king to h8 would block my own pawn's promotion path, so that's not good.

The best move is to keep my king close to the pawn while maintaining flexibility:

I can see we're in an endgame position where I'm playing as Black with my king on f6 and a pawn on h7. White has a king on e5 and pawns on a4, b4, and h4. Let me check what legal moves I have available.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

I see my legal moves. It appears my king is actually on f7 (not f6 as I initially thought). 

Looking at the position, I need to make a good king move. Since this is an endgame with pawns on both sides of the board, I should try to position my king optimally. The white king is on e5, so I need to consider both defending my h7 pawn and potentially stopping White's queenside pawns.

Moving my king to e7 seems strong as it maintains centralization while staying connected to my h-pawn. This position allows me to potentially move toward the queenside if needed while still being able to return to defend my pawn.

- I'm playing as Black with my king on e6 and a pawn on h7
- White has a king on f2 and pawns on a4, b4, and h4

Let me check what legal moves I have available.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Now I can see my legal moves. I'm playing as Black with my king on e7 (not e6 as I initially thought).

In this endgame position, I need to make a decision about where to move my king. Looking at the position:

1. The white king is on f2, far from my pawn on h7
2. My king should aim to support my h-pawn's advance while preventing White's pawns from advancing

The most principled move is to head toward my h-pawn to support its promotion. Moving to f6 or f7 would be steps in that direction.

I'll choose to move my king to f7, which maintains control of the e-file while moving closer to my h-pawn.

Since my king is on f7, I should try to stop White's b7 pawn from promoting. The best move is to head toward that pawn with my king.

Looking at the position, I notice:
- My king can move in 8 different directions
- I have pawns on h3 and h4 that are advanced
- White's king is far away on g1
- White has pawns on a4 and b2

The best strategy here is to advance my king toward the white pawns while keeping an eye on my own pawns' promotion path. Moving my king to the queenside will help me capture White's pawns while my h-pawns can potentially promote.

- The white king is on f1

Strategic assessment:
1. The b7 pawn is the most immediate threat as it's one move away from promotion
2. I need to position my king to either capture that pawn or stop its promotion

The best move is to move my king to c6, which will allow me to capture the b7 pawn next move before it promotes.

- c6d6 (move king right)
- c6d5 (move king down-right)
- c6c5 (move king down)
- c6b5 (move king down-left)

Looking at the position, I need to consider my king's safety and potential advancement. The White king is far away on e1, so I have some freedom to maneuver. I should try to advance my king toward the center while maintaining control of my pawns.

Moving to d5 (c6d5) looks good as it:
1. Centralizes my king
2. Moves toward the White king
3. Maintains control of my h-pawns
4. Doesn't walk into any immediate threats

I can see my available moves. I'm playing as Black with my king on d5, and there are several pawns on the board.

Looking at the position:
- White has pawns on a4, b3, and h4
- Black has a pawn on h3
- My king is on d5 with 8 possible moves

This is a critical endgame position. My priority should be to:
1. Advance my h3 pawn if possible
2. Use my king to stop White's pawns
3. Create a passed pawn situation

The most urgent threat is White's b3 pawn which could advance. I should position my king to control its path.

I'll move my king to c4, which:
- Attacks White's b3 pawn directly
- Prevents the b3 pawn from advancing
- Maintains control of the center
- Keeps my king active in the endgame

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Now I understand my options. I have 5 legal moves for my king on c4:
- c4d5 (move king diagonally up-right)
- c4c5 (move king up)
- c4b5 (move king diagonally up-left)
- c4d4 (move king right)
- c4b4 (move king left)

Looking at the position, I need to consider the pawn structure. White has pawns on a4, b6, and h7, while I have pawns on h3 and h8. The position is quite sparse.

My priority should be to activate my king and potentially stop White's pawns. Moving my king upward would be beneficial to contest the b6 pawn, which is quite advanced.

I'll choose to move my king to c5, which maintains central control and moves toward the advanced b6 pawn.

I see the current position now. As Black, I have my king on c5, and there's a White pawn on b2, a White pawn on a4, a White pawn on h4, and a Black pawn on h6. The White king is on d3.

Looking at my legal moves, I need to make a strategic decision. Since I'm playing as Black with my king on c5, I should consider:

1. The proximity of the White king at d3
2. The passed pawns on both sides
3. My king's activity

The most principled move here is to advance my king toward the White pawns while maintaining control of the queening squares of White's pawns.

- Black king on d4
- White king on d2
- White pawns on a2, b2, and h4
- Black pawn on h3

Let me check what legal moves I have as Black.

Now I understand my options. As Black, I have 5 legal moves:
- d4e5 (King to e5)
- d4d5 (King to d5)
- d4c5 (King to c5)
- d4e4 (King to e4)
- d4c4 (King to c4)

Analyzing the position:
- This is a king and pawn endgame where I need to be careful about White's pawns on the queenside
- My king is currently centralized, which is good
- I should try to prevent White's pawns from advancing while potentially supporting my h3 pawn

The move d4d5 looks strongest as it:
1. Maintains central control
2. Prevents White's king from advancing to d3
3. Keeps options to move toward either the queenside pawns or my own h-pawn as needed

- White pawns on a3, b3, and h4
- Black pawn on h3

Let me check what legal moves I have as Black.

I see my legal moves. I'm playing as Black with my king on d5 (not d6 as I initially thought).

Let me analyze the position:
- I have a king on d5 and a pawn on h3
- White has a king on d1 and pawns on a3, b3, and h4
- My king is currently centralized, which is good in an endgame
- White's king is far away from my pawn, while my king could potentially approach White's pawns

The best strategy here is to use my king to either:
1. Approach and capture White's queenside pawns while keeping an eye on White's h-pawn
2. Support my own h-pawn's advance

Since White's king is far away on d1, I'll move my king toward the queenside pawns.

Let me check what legal moves I have as Black.

- c4c5 (move king up)
- c4b5 (move king up-left)
- c4d4 (move king right)
- c4b4 (move king left)
- c4b3 (move king down-left)

Looking at the position, I need to consider:
1. The white pawns on a7 and b7 are close to promotion
2. My king is currently not in position to stop them
3. My h7 pawn could potentially advance

The most urgent threat is the white pawns about to promote. I need to get my king closer to them. Moving my king to d5 gets me one step closer to the queenside pawns while maintaining control of the center.

My available moves are:

Looking at the position, I need to consider:
1. The two white pawns on a6 and b6 are advancing toward promotion
2. My pawn on h6 is opposed by White's pawn on h7
3. White's king is far away on c1

The most urgent concern is stopping White's pawns. Moving my king to c6 would put me in position to capture the b6 pawn next move and then potentially the a6 pawn.

Looking at the position, I need to make a strategic decision:
1. The white pawns on a7 and b6 are dangerous and close to promotion
2. My king needs to stop these pawns while keeping my own pawns advancing if possible

The most urgent threat is the a7 pawn which is one step away from queening. I need to get my king in position to capture it or block its advance.

The best move is to go toward the a7 pawn with:

Looking at the position, capturing the White pawn on b6 is clearly the best move. This removes one of White's pawns without any risk to my king, improving my material advantage. The other moves don't gain material.

I see the current position. We have a very simplified endgame with:
- Black king on b7
- White king on b2
- Black pawn on h6
- White pawns on a7 and h5

Let me check what legal moves I have as Black.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

I see my legal moves. This is a critical endgame position where I need to make the best decision as Black.

Looking at the position:
- My king is on b7 with several possible moves
- My pawn is on h6 and can potentially promote
- White has a dangerous pawn on a7 that's close to promotion
- White also has a pawn on h5 that's blocking my h-pawn

The most urgent threat is White's a7 pawn. I need to keep my king close to control it. At the same time, I don't want to capture it immediately since that would likely lead to a draw (White's king is too close to my h-pawn).

The best move is to maintain control of the a7 pawn while keeping options open:

Let me check what legal moves I have available.

Now I understand my options. I have four legal moves:
- a6b7: Move my king diagonally up-right
- a6a7: Move my king vertically up
- a6b5: Move my king diagonally down-right
- a6a5: Move my king vertically down

Looking at the position, I need to consider my king's safety and potential threats. The white knight on a8 is not an immediate threat but could become one in a few moves. The white king on b2 is far away. 

I'll move my king to b7, which keeps me away from the white knight while maintaining control of my h7 pawn's promotion path.

Since I have the opportunity to capture White's knight on a8 without any apparent risk, that's clearly the best move. Capturing material when it's safe to do so is a basic principle in chess.

I see my options now. I have three legal moves:
- a8b8: Move my king horizontally to b8
- a8b7: Move my king diagonally to b7
- a8a7: Move my king vertically to a7

In this position, my goal as Black is to support my pawn on h6 to promote while preventing White's pawn from promoting. Since both pawns are on the h-file and mine is more advanced, I should try to get my king closer to them.

The principle in king and pawn endgames is to move your king toward the action. My king needs to get closer to the h-file to support my pawn.

I'll move my king diagonally, which gets me one step closer to the pawns.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Now I understand the position completely. As Black, I have a king on b7 and a pawn on h6, while White has a king on b2 and a pawn on h4.

This is a critical endgame position. My goal should be to either:
1. Advance my h-pawn to promotion if possible
2. Stop White's h-pawn from promoting
3. Maintain good king position

Looking at the position, I need to decide whether to race with my pawn or use my king to stop White's pawn. Since both pawns are on the h-file and quite advanced, this is likely a race.

The principle in such positions is to use my king effectively. Moving toward the center gives me more flexibility to deal with both the white king and potentially stop the white pawn if needed.

I'll play:

make_move b7c6

This centralizes my king, maintaining control and flexibility. From c6, my king can potentially move toward the h-file if needed while staying active.

Now I have a clear picture of the position and my available moves. 

Looking at the position, I notice:
- White has played d4 and h4
- I've developed both knights to c6 and f6
- My e-pawn is challenging White's d-pawn

I have several good options here. I could:
1. Capture White's d-pawn with e5xd4
2. Develop my bishop with Bf8-e7 or Bf8-d6
3. Play d7-d6 to support my e5 pawn

The most principled move is to develop my bishop, with Bf8-e7 being particularly solid as it maintains flexibility and prepares for castling.

Now let's check what legal moves I have available.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Thank you for providing the legal moves. I notice that I have the option to castle kingside with e8g8, which is an excellent move in this position. Castling will:

1. Bring my king to safety
2. Connect my rooks
3. Begin to activate my h8 rook

This is a natural developing move that improves my king's safety while preparing to contest the center and open files. Since my dark-squared bishop is already developed to e7 and my knights are on good squares, castling is the logical next step in my development.

The move f6h5 (Knight from f6 to h5) recaptures the pawn and maintains my piece count. This is a natural move that develops my position while not allowing White to gain material advantage.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Thank you for providing the legal moves. Let me analyze the position and make a decision.

I notice that one of my legal moves is c6d4, which would capture White's pawn on d4. This looks like a good opportunity to win material. Let me check if there are any immediate threats or tactical issues with this capture.

If I take the pawn with Nxd4, White could recapture with the c3 pawn (cxd4) or the knight on d2 (Nxd4). If White recaptures with the pawn, I've traded a knight for a pawn, which is unfavorable. If White recaptures with the knight, we trade knights, which is equal.

Looking at other options, I should consider developing my queenside. Moving my queen's rook with a8b8 (Rb8) would connect my rooks and prepare for action on the queenside.

After careful consideration, I'll develop my queenside rook:

After analyzing the position and my available legal moves, I need to make a strategic decision.

I notice I have a knight on h5 that's quite active and could potentially fork White's pieces. I also see my bishop on e7 has several good diagonal options. My pawn structure is intact, though I need to be careful about development.

I'll play a solid developing move that improves my position:

make_move e7f6

This move develops my bishop to a strong diagonal, protects my g7 pawn, and prepares for potential kingside castling. It also maintains control of key central squares.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

I need to analyze the position carefully before making my move.

Looking at the board, I notice:
- I'm playing as Black and have a knight on h5 that's attacking something
- White has a bishop on h7 that's threatening my position
- My king is on g8 with a rook on f8
- The pawn structure shows I have a pawn on d4 that's advanced

One of the most critical moves appears to be dealing with the bishop on h7, which is putting pressure on my kingside. The knight on h5 can capture something (likely on f4).

After evaluating the position, I'll make a move with my knight on h5 to f4, which appears to be a strong square that likely attacks White's pieces or important squares.

After analyzing the position, I see several good options. I notice I have two knights (on c6 and f4) that can make active moves, and my bishop on f6 also has mobility.

The knight on f4 is particularly well-placed and can make several interesting moves. I think the most impactful move would be to play Nf4-d5, creating pressure in the center and potentially threatening White's queen or other pieces.

- White has a queen on c2 that could be dangerous

One strong move I see is developing my knight on d5 to e3, which would fork White's queen and king. This would be a powerful tactical shot.

3. I have a pawn on d4 that's advanced
4. My bishop on f6 has good diagonal control

Among my options, I think the most valuable move is to complete my kingside castle, which will improve my king's safety and connect my rooks.

- White has a bishop on h7 that's threatening my king
- I need to address the bishop threat while maintaining my counterplay

The knight on g2 is a strong piece that's putting pressure on White's position. I should consider either using it for a tactic or retreating it to safety if needed.

One of the most promising moves is to castle kingside with either h8g8 or f8g8, which would connect my rooks and improve my king's safety.

After careful consideration, I'll castle kingside:

- My king is on g8 with rooks on b8 and h8
- I need to consider both attacking opportunities and defensive needs

The knight on g2 is a strong piece that's putting pressure on White's position. I should consider whether to maintain it there or use it for a tactical move.

Given the position, I think one of the strongest moves is to move my king to safety from the bishop's influence.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Thank you for providing the legal moves. Let me analyze the position:

I notice that:
- I'm playing as Black and have a knight on g2 that's deep in White's territory
- White has a bishop on h7 that's threatening my kingside
- White has a queen on b3 that could be applying pressure

Looking at my options, the knight on g2 is particularly interesting as it's an active piece that could create threats. Let me use this knight to create a tactical opportunity.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

After analyzing the position and available moves, I notice several key factors:

1. White's queen on e5 is threatening my knight on c6
2. I have two knights (c6 and e3) that could potentially capture the queen
3. My bishop on f6 is also attacking the queen

The most direct response would be to capture White's queen with one of my pieces. Among the options, capturing with the knight from e3 seems strongest as it maintains better piece coordination.

I apologize for the error. Let me check the board again. It seems I misread the position. White's queen is on e6, not e5, and my knight is on e3. Let me make a valid move.

After analyzing the position, I see several interesting options. 

I notice my queen is under attack by the white bishop on h5, so I need to address that immediately. I also see that I have two knights that could develop into strong positions.

Looking at the position more carefully, I see that moving my queen to e7 would both escape the attack and protect my knight on c6. This seems like a solid defensive move that also maintains good piece coordination.

After analyzing the position and my available legal moves, I notice several key factors:

1. My king is on h8 with the rook on f8, so I can consider castling kingside (f8g8)
2. My queen on e7 is under attack by the white queen on e5
3. I have knights on c6 and c4 that could develop to better squares
4. The white king is on e2, somewhat exposed

The most urgent issue is my queen being under attack. I need to move it to safety while maintaining an active position.

I'll move my queen to d6, which:
- Moves it out of danger
- Maintains control of central squares
- Keeps pressure on White's position
- Supports my knight on c4

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

After analyzing the position, I see several key factors:

1. My king is on h8 with a rook on f8, allowing for potential castling
2. White's queen is on e5, putting pressure on my position
3. I have a queen on d4 that has many possible moves
4. I have knights on c6 and c4 that could be developed

One of the strongest moves I see is to attack White's queen with my knight while developing my piece:

After analyzing the position, I see I'm playing as Black with a fairly developed position. I have my queen on d4 and knights on c4 and e5, with pressure on the center.

I notice my queen on d4 has many options, and I should consider both attacking opportunities and potential threats. One strong move is to attack White's queen on h4 while also threatening the pawn on b2.

I'll analyze the position and make a strategic move as Black.

Looking at the board, I notice:
- I have two knights (on e5 and c4) that are actively placed
- White has a queen on h5 that could be threatening
- My king on g8 seems exposed with the white bishop on h7

Among my options, I see some strong knight moves. The knight on e5 can go to g6, which would protect my kingside and potentially threaten White's queen. The knight on c4 has several good options as well.

I'll choose to strengthen my king's position and create a threat with:

The most immediate opportunity is capturing White's bishop on e5 with my knight from e3. This would win a piece since the bishop appears undefended.

- White has a queen on h5 which could be threatening
- My king is on g8 with rooks on b8 and f8
- White has a bishop on h7 which appears to be attacking my kingside

The knight on g4 seems to be in a strong position, potentially forking White's queen and another piece. Let me check if I can use this knight to create a threat.

The move g4e3 looks promising as it attacks White's kingside while potentially threatening a fork. This knight move would put pressure on White's position.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Now I have a clear picture of the position and my available moves. Let me analyze the situation:

I notice I have two knights (on e3 and g6), two bishops (on b8 and f6), and my king is on g8 with rooks on b8 and f8. White has a queen on h5 which could be threatening, and bishops on a4 and h3.

Looking at my options, I should consider:
1. Knight moves that could improve my position or create threats
2. Pawn advances to gain space
3. King safety

The knight on e3 is quite active and could potentially fork pieces. Let me play:

make_move e3g4

This knight move attacks White's queen on h5, forcing it to move, while also potentially threatening other pieces depending on how White responds. This is a tactical opportunity that should improve my position.

After analyzing the position and my available legal moves, I notice I have several tactical opportunities.

I see that my knight on g4 is attacking White's queen on h2, and I also have a bishop on f6 that could potentially develop with tempo. My king safety is also important to consider.

I'll play the knight move g4-e3, which forks White's king on e1 and the bishop on a4. This is a strong tactical move that will either win material or create significant threats.

One strong move would be to develop my rook to e8, connecting my rooks and controlling the e-file:

The knight on c4 is well-placed and active. I should consider developing my pieces further and improving my position. The knight on g6 could be improved by moving to e5, which would attack White's bishop on d3 and create a strong central outpost.

- White has a bishop on h7 that's attacking my kingside
- My king is on g8 with rooks on b8 and g8

Among my options:
- Knight moves like e5-g6 or c4-e3 could be strong
- I could also consider king safety with g8-f8
- Pawn advances to create counterplay

The knight on e5 is particularly well-placed and could move to g6, creating threats while protecting the kingside. This seems like a strong move that improves my position.

I'll analyze the position and make a strategic move as Black.

Looking at the board, I notice:
- White has a queen on d4 and knights on d4 and h4
- My king is on g8 with rooks on b8 and g7
- I have knights on g6 and c4, bishops on f6 and b8
- White has a bishop on h7 which is attacking my king's position

The most pressing issue is my king's safety. I should prioritize that first. I notice I can move my king to f8 to get out of potential threats.

I can see the board position and my legal moves. Let me analyze the situation:

1. I'm playing as Black and my king is on g8
2. White's queen is on d4, threatening my position
3. I have knights on g6 and c4, bishops on f6 and f8, and rooks on b8 and f8

Looking at the position, I notice my knight on c4 is quite active and could potentially fork White's pieces. I also need to be careful about the White queen on d4 and the bishops on g5 and b3.

One strong move would be to play the knight from c4 to e3, which attacks White's king on e1 and creates a fork with another piece. This puts immediate pressure on White.

I'll play the knight fork:

- My king is on g8 with rooks on b8 and f8

Looking at the threats and opportunities:
- White's queen on c5 is putting pressure on my position
- My knight on g2 is well-placed and could potentially fork pieces
- I should consider improving my position and addressing any immediate threats

After evaluating the available moves, I'll play the knight on g2 to e3, which attacks White's bishop on b3 and creates a fork threat against White's king on d3 and rook on a1.

4. My king is on g8 with rooks on b8 and f8

Looking at my options, I notice my knight on e3 is very active and can make several strong moves. It's currently attacking White's f1 square and could potentially fork pieces.

Given the position, I'll move my knight from e3 to c4, which puts pressure on White's queen and maintains my knight in an active central position.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

After analyzing the position and my available legal moves, I can see several key factors:

1. I'm playing as Black and have a knight on d2 that's attacking White's king on d3
2. White's queen is on c3 and bishop on g4, creating pressure
3. I have potential tactical opportunities with my knight on d2

The most critical move here is to capitalize on the knight fork I have with Nd2, which is attacking both the white king on d3 and the rook on a1.

I'll analyze the position:

I'm playing as Black and I notice several key aspects of the position:
- White has a queen on c5 and a bishop on h7
- My king is on g8 with a rook on f8
- I have knights on g6 and b3
- White's king is on d3, somewhat exposed

Looking at my legal moves, I see several promising options:

1. Knight moves: My knight on b3 can attack White's queen with b3c5 or potentially fork pieces with b3d4
2. King safety: I can move my king to g8 with h8g8
3. Rook moves: I can move my rook along the f-file

The most critical move appears to be attacking White's queen with my knight:

After analyzing the position, I see several good options. I notice I have a bishop on f6 and knights on g6 and c5, with a relatively safe king position.

I'll play a knight move that improves my piece positioning and creates threats:

make_move c5e4

This move places my knight on e4, which is a strong central square. From there, it controls important squares like d6, f6, c3, and g3. It also creates potential threats against White's position and improves my overall piece coordination. This knight on e4 will be difficult for White to dislodge without making concessions.

I see that I'm playing as Black and have several interesting options. The position appears to be in the middlegame with both kings castled. I notice my knight on e4 is quite active and centralized.

Looking at the legal moves, I have tactical opportunities with my knight on e4, which is threatening White's king area. The move e4f2 looks particularly strong as it's a knight fork attacking White's king on f3 and potentially another piece.

After careful consideration, I'll play the knight fork:

- White has a bishop on h7 which is attacking my king's position
- I have knights on g6 and f2, with the f2 knight being quite active
- There's a white knight on d4 that could be threatening

The f2 knight is particularly well-placed, forking White's king on f3 and potentially other pieces. I should consider moves that maintain this pressure or improve my position.

Among my options, the knight move f2-d3+ looks strong as it gives check to the White king while maintaining pressure.

- The pawn structure is relatively intact

Given the knight on d3 is putting pressure near White's king on f1, I should consider if there are any tactical opportunities there. The knight on d3 can move to f2, which would be a fork attacking White's king and rook.

2. I have a bishop on f6 that can move to g7
3. My rook on h8 can move to either g8 or g7
4. White has a bishop on g7 that's threatening my position
5. White's king is on f3 and has knights on e5 and e1

Looking at my options:
- h8g8: Moving my rook from h8 to g8 (sideways)
- h8g7: Capturing White's bishop on g7 with my rook
- f6g7: Moving my bishop from f6 to g7

The best move here is to capture White's bishop with my rook, eliminating the threat and gaining material.

After analyzing the position, I can see I'm playing as Black and have several options. I notice my king is on g7, and I have a knight on g6 and a bishop on f6. White has knights on e4 and e5, with the white king on f2.

Looking at my options, I should prioritize development and king safety. The knight on g6 has several good options, and the bishop on f6 can also make some strong moves.

I'll choose to develop my bishop with a move that controls important central squares:

make_move f6e5

This move:
1. Attacks White's knight on e4
2. Controls central squares
3. Improves my piece activity
4. Creates potential tactical opportunities

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

I'll analyze the position as Black:

The position shows I have two bishops (one on e5), a knight on g6, and both rooks. My king is on g7, and I have a fairly solid pawn structure. White has two knights (on e5 and e7), a king on e5, and two rooks.

Looking at my options:
- My bishop on e5 is very active and has multiple good squares
- My knight on g6 has mobility
- I could develop my rooks

The bishop on e5 is particularly strong, attacking White's position. I notice it's threatening the h2 square, which could be a powerful diagonal.

I'll make a move with my bishop on e5, extending its influence to h2:

make_move e5h2

1. I have a bishop on h2 that's actively placed on the long diagonal
2. White has knights on e4 and e5, with the king on f3
3. My king is on g7 with a knight on g6

Among my options, the bishop on h2 has several strong moves. The move h2g3 looks particularly powerful as it:
- Checks the white king
- Cannot be captured immediately
- Controls important squares

This forces White to respond to the check and gives me the initiative.

Given the position, I'll make a move with my knight from g6 to e5, which gives me a centralized knight with good control over key squares.

I can see all my legal moves now. Let me analyze the position:

I'm playing as Black and I notice:
- Material is roughly even
- My king is on g7 with good pawn protection
- I have a knight on e5 in a strong central position
- White has a knight on g3 and another on e1

The knight on e5 is particularly strong and could be used for a tactical opportunity. One of the best moves would be to use this knight to attack White's position.

Looking at the knight moves from e5, I can see e5f3 would attack White's king on f2, creating a check. This is a strong tactical move that forces White to respond.

One strong move would be to develop my rook to e8, creating pressure down the e-file and preparing for potential central play.

I need to analyze this position carefully. I'm playing as Black and I notice:

1. My king is on g7
2. White has a rook on g4 that's attacking my g-file
3. I have rooks on b8 and e8
4. White has knights on g3 and e1, and a rook on a2

Looking at my legal moves, I should prioritize safety and development. The rook on e8 has many options, including castling (e8g8), but I need to be careful about the white rook on g4.

Since my king is already on g7, castling isn't a traditional castle but would just move my rook to the kingside. This could be useful to defend against threats on the g-file and connect my rooks.

I'll play the rook move e8g8, which will place my rook next to my king for better defense and control of the g-file.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Looking at the board and my legal moves, I need to assess the situation:

1. White's rook is on g4, threatening my knight on g6
2. My king is on g7, and I need to ensure its safety
3. I have several pawn moves and rook moves available

The most pressing issue is my knight on g6 being under attack by White's rook. I should either move the knight or defend it. Since the knight is an important piece, I'll move it to safety.

The move g6h8 would place the knight in the corner where it has limited mobility. The move g6e5 would be better positioning, but it's not in my legal moves list.

Looking at the available knight moves, g6f8 seems best as it retreats to safety while maintaining some control of the center.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

I apologize for the error. Let me check the board again more carefully. I misread the position.

Looking at the board again, I see that the knight is actually on g6 in my notation, but it must be labeled differently in the UCI format. Let me check the legal moves again and make a correct move.

From the legal moves list, I see "g7h6" is available, which would move my king out of potential danger. Let me make that move.

Now I have a clear picture of the position and my available moves. Let me analyze the situation:

1. My king is on h6, and White has a rook on g4 that's currently checking me.
2. I need to address this check immediately.
3. I have two options to deal with the check:
   - Move my king to g6 or g7
   - Block with my knight from g5 to f3 or h3
   - Capture the rook with my knight (g5 to g4)

Looking at the legal moves, I don't see g5g4 listed, so capturing the rook isn't an option. The safest response appears to be moving my king to g7, which gets me out of check and improves my king's position.

- White has knights on g3 and e1, and a rook on a2
- My king is somewhat exposed

The most urgent issue is addressing the threat from the rook on g4. I should either move my king to safety or block/capture the rook.

Looking at my legal moves, I see I can move my king to h8, f8, h6, g6, or f6. Moving to h8 seems safest as it gets out of the direct line of the rook.

The best move here is to capture the rook on g7 with my king.

I need to analyze the position carefully before making my move.

Looking at the board, I notice:
- White has a knight on e5 and e1, and rooks on g4 and b2
- I have a knight on g5 that's currently under attack by White's rook on g4
- My king is on g8 with rooks on a8 and h8
- The pawn structure is relatively intact

The most pressing issue is my knight on g5 being attacked by White's rook. I need to either move it to safety or defend it.

Among my legal moves, I see several knight moves: g5e6, g5e4, g5h3, and g5f3. The best option seems to be g5e6, which moves the knight to safety while maintaining its activity in the center.

I need to analyze the position carefully before making my move.

Looking at the board, I see that:
- I'm playing as Black with my king on g8
- White has a rook on g4 that's attacking my g-file
- White has knights on e4 and f5, and a rook on b2
- White's king is on g1

Key considerations:
1. My king safety is important - the white rook on g4 is threatening the g-file
2. My knight on e6 is active and could potentially make a good move
3. I should consider pawn moves that improve my position

After evaluating the options, I'll make a move with my knight on e6, which can develop into a more active position:

- I'm playing as Black with my king on g8
- White has a king on h1 and two knights (e4 and f5), a rook on b1, and some pawns
- I have a knight on c5 which is quite active
- Material seems roughly equal

Key considerations:
- My knight on c5 has several good options
- I should consider king safety and development

Among the knight moves, c5e4 looks particularly strong as it captures White's knight. This would gain material and improve my position.

My knight on e4 is in a strong central position and has several attractive moves. One particularly strong option is to fork White's king and rook with Ne4f2+, which would give a check and threaten the rook on c1 simultaneously.

I see I'm playing as Black and my king is on g8. White has a rook on c1, a knight on f3, and the white king is on h1. I have a rook on b8, a bishop on c8, and a knight on f2 which is attacking White's position.

My knight on f2 is actually a very strong piece - it's deep in White's territory and has several good options. It's currently attacking White's rook on c1 and could also deliver a check by moving to either h3 or e4.

Looking at the legal moves, I think the best move is to check the white king with my knight:

Player_Black (to Proxy):

I need to analyze the position carefully before making my move.

Looking at the board:
- I'm playing as Black with my king on g8
- White has a knight on d4 and a rook on c1
- I have a knight on f2 which is actively placed in White's territory
- The pawn structure is mostly intact

My knight on f2 is a strong piece that's currently attacking White's position. I should consider whether to maintain it there or use it for a tactical move.

Among my options:
- Moving my king (g8h8, g8f8, g8g7)
- Moving my rook (b8a8)
- Various knight moves from f2
- Pawn advances

The knight on f2 is my most active piece, and it's currently forking White's king on g1 and rook on c1. This is a powerful tactical opportunity.

I'll capture the rook with my knight:

Player_Black (to Proxy):

I need to carefully analyze this position as Black. 

I see that I have a knight on d1 that can make several moves, and my king on g8 can move to adjacent squares. I also have various pawn moves available.

Looking at the board, White has a rook on c4 and a knight on d4 that could be threatening. My king appears safe for now, but I should consider improving my position.

The knight on d1 is well-placed and could potentially fork pieces if moved to e3 or c3. Moving to e3 would attack White's rook on c4.

I'll make this move:

3. My knight on e3 is well-placed and has several good options
4. I should consider both defensive and active moves

The knight on e3 is particularly strong and can make several good moves. Moving it to f5 would be especially powerful as it attacks White's position and controls important squares.

- White has a rook on b4 and a knight on d4
- My king is on g8 with limited mobility
- I have a knight on f5 which has several options
- My rook on b8 is currently blocked by my pawn on b7

Looking at the threats and opportunities:
- The white rook on b4 is attacking my b-file
- My knight on f5 is well-positioned and has many possible moves

I should prioritize king safety and development. The knight on f5 is already well-placed, so I should consider improving my other pieces or addressing immediate threats.

Moving the king to h8 (g8h8) is a reasonable prophylactic move that gives my king a bit more safety. This is often a good move in middlegame positions to avoid potential checks along the g-file.

- The pawn structure is relatively intact for both sides
- White's king is on g2

The most pressing concern is ensuring my king's safety. I notice my rook on b8 is undefended, and moving my king to g8 would protect it while maintaining a solid position.

Looking at my options, I notice:
1. My knight on f5 has several possible moves
2. I can move my king to h8 or f8
3. I have various pawn moves available

Since White's rook is on b2 and could potentially become active on the second rank, I should consider my defensive options. My knight on f5 is well-placed, controlling several squares. 

One strong move would be to play Nf5-g7, which defends my king and maintains the knight's activity. This knight move protects the h7 pawn and controls important squares.

You are a professional chess player and you play as black. Now is your turn to make a move. Before making a move you can pick one of the following actions:
- 'get_current_board' to get the schema and current status of the board
- 'get_legal_moves' to get a UCI formatted list of available moves
- 'make_move <UCI formatted move>' when you are ready to complete your turn (e.g., 'make_move e2e4')

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

I need to analyze this position carefully. 

I see that I'm playing as Black and my king is on h8. White has a rook on b4 and knights on a8 and b5. My pieces include a rook on b8, a bishop on c8, a knight on g7, and several pawns.

Looking at the legal moves, I notice that my king is somewhat exposed. Moving the king to g8 would be a good defensive move to get it away from the edge of the board. I also need to consider developing my pieces and improving my position.

The knight on g7 has several possible moves (e8, e6, h5, f5), but I should be careful not to leave my king vulnerable.

After evaluating the position, I believe the best move is to move my king to g8, which improves my king's position and safety.

- I have my king on g8, a knight on g7, a rook on b8, a bishop on c8, and several pawns

Key observations:
- My king is in the corner with limited mobility
- White's rook on f4 could be threatening along the f-file
- I should consider developing my pieces and ensuring king safety

Looking at my legal moves, I notice I can develop my knight from g7 to e6, which would be a good central square. This move would improve my piece activity and potentially prepare for counterplay.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

I need to analyze the position carefully before making my move.

Looking at the board:
- I'm playing as Black with my king on g8
- White has a rook on f5 and knights on a8 and b5
- I have a knight on e6, a rook on b8, and a bishop on c8
- The pawn structure is relatively intact on the queenside

Key considerations:
1. My knight on e6 is well-positioned and has multiple good options
2. I should be careful about potential threats from White's rook on f5
3. My king's safety is important

After evaluating the position, I think the best move is to develop my knight to a more active position. The knight on e6 can move to g5, putting pressure on White's position and potentially creating threats.

Let me analyze the position:

I'm playing as Black, and I notice several important features:
- White has a rook on f6 that's attacking my f7 pawn
- My king is on g8 with limited mobility
- I have a knight on g5 that could potentially make some useful moves
- White has knights on a8 and b5, and a rook on f6 as active pieces

Looking at my legal moves, I need to address the threat to my f7 pawn and improve my position. The knight on g5 has some interesting options.

I'll move my knight from g5 to e6, which:
1. Defends the f7 pawn that's under attack by the white rook
2. Places my knight on a strong central square
3. Maintains activity of my knight

g8h8,g8f8,e6g7,h7g6,f7g6

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Now I understand the position and my available moves. Let me analyze the situation:

I'm playing as Black and I see:
- My king is on g8 with moves to h8 or f8
- I have a knight on e6 that can move to g7
- I can push my h7 pawn to g6
- I can push my f7 pawn to g6
- White has a rook on g7 threatening my king
- White has knights on a8 and b5
- White's king is on f2

This is a critical position. My king is in check from the white rook on g7, so I must address this immediately. Looking at my options:

1. g8h8 - Moving my king to the corner
2. g8f8 - Moving my king to the f-file
3. e6g7 - Capturing the checking rook with my knight

Capturing the rook with my knight is clearly the best move as it eliminates the immediate threat and gains material.

I need to analyze this position carefully. 

I see that White has a knight on b5 and a rook on g4, creating some pressure. My king is on g8, and I have a knight on f7, a bishop on c8, and a rook on b8. I need to consider safety and development.

Looking at the legal moves, I notice:
- I can move my king to h8 or f8
- I can move my rook from b8 to a8
- I have various pawn moves available

The knight on f7 is protecting the h6 square, which is important. Moving the king to h8 seems reasonable as it gets out of the g-file where White's rook is. This is a common safety move in many positions.

3. White's king is on f2

I notice White's rook on g7 is attacking my position, and I need to address this threat. Among my options:

1. Moving my king to g8 (h8g8) would get me out of any potential checks
2. Moving my knight could potentially defend or counter-attack
3. I could also consider pawn moves to strengthen my position

- 'get_current_board' to get the schema and current status of the board
- 'get_legal_moves' to get a UCI formatted list of available moves
- 'make_move <UCI formatted move>' when you are ready to complete your turn (e.g., 'make_move e2e4')

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Looking at the position, I notice I'm playing as Black and there's a critical situation with White's rook on g7 threatening my king on g8. This is a very dangerous position that requires immediate attention.

My king is under attack and I need to move it. I have two options: g8h8 or g8f8. Moving to h8 would be a mistake as it would allow White's rook to deliver checkmate with Rg8#. 

The best move is to move my king to f8, getting away from the rook's attack:

I notice that:
- I have my king on f8 with a rook on b8 and bishop on c8
- White has a knight on a1 and a5, and a rook on g3
- White's king is on f2

Among my options, I should consider king safety and piece development. The move Kg8 (f8g8) looks good as it moves my king to a safer square in the corner, away from potential threats along the f-file. This is a standard kingside castle-like position that would provide better protection.

I'm playing as Black and have a significant material advantage with a rook, bishop, knight, and several pawns against White's rook, two knights, and a pawn. My king is on h8 with a rook on b8 and knight on g7.

Looking at the legal moves, I notice I can improve my king's safety by castling (which appears as h8g8 in the move list). This would move my king away from the edge of the board and connect my rooks.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

I need to analyze this position carefully as Black.

Looking at the board:
- I'm playing as Black with my king on g8
- White has a king on f2, a rook on d1, and knights on a1 and c4
- I have a rook on b8, a bishop on c8, and a knight on e6
- The pawn structure is relatively intact

Let me consider my best options:

The knight on e6 is well-positioned and has several good moves. I should also consider my king's safety and potential development of my pieces.

One strong move is to develop my bishop with:

make_move c8f5

This develops my bishop to an active square, controls important central squares, and prepares for potential kingside castling. The bishop on f5 will exert pressure on White's position and improve my overall piece coordination.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

I apologize for the error. Let me check the legal moves again and make a valid move.

From the legal moves list, I see options like developing my knight at e6, moving my king, or advancing pawns.

After analyzing the position, I'll make a strong move with my knight:

make_move e6g5

This knight move improves my piece position, controls important central squares, and puts pressure on White's position. The knight on g5 will be more active and could potentially threaten White's king position.

You are a professional chess player and you play as black. Now is your turn to make a move. Before making a move you can pick one of the following actions:
- 'get_current_board' to get the schema and current status of the board
- 'get_legal_moves' to get a UCI formatted list of available moves
- 'make_move <UCI formatted move>' when you are ready to complete your turn (e.g., 'make_move e2e4')

Player_Black (to Proxy):

I need to analyze the position carefully before making my move.

Looking at the board, I'm playing as Black and I notice:
- My king is on g8
- I have a knight on e6 which is active
- White has a knight on a1 and c4, and a king on f1 with a rook on h1
- The position seems to be in the middlegame/endgame phase

The knight on e6 has several good options. Moving it to f4 would put pressure on White's position. However, I should also consider king safety.

I think the best move is to develop my knight to a more active position while putting pressure on White's position.

I can see all my legal moves now. Let me analyze the position:

I'm playing as Black and have a knight on f4 that's quite active. I also notice my king is on g8 with a rook on b8 and a bishop on c8. White has knights on a1 and c4, with the white king on f1 and a rook on h1.

Looking at my options, I should consider:
1. Developing my pieces further
2. Improving my king's safety
3. Exploiting my active knight on f4

The knight on f4 has several good options. Moving it to d5 would create a central outpost, or to g6 could protect my king while maintaining pressure.

After consideration, I'll move my knight to d5 where it controls important central squares and can't be easily attacked.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

After analyzing the position and my legal moves, I'll make a decision.

I notice I'm playing as Black and have a material advantage with a rook, bishop, knight, and several pawns against White's king, rook, and two knights. My king is on g8, and I should prioritize both safety and active piece coordination.

The knight on d5 is well-placed in the center and has multiple good options. One particularly strong move would be to play Nd5-f6, which:
1. Controls important central squares
2. Protects the king
3. Threatens to advance toward White's king

I need to make a good move here. Looking at my options:

1. King safety is a priority - I could move my king to h8 or f8
2. My knight on f6 has several possible moves
3. I can advance various pawns

The most active and developing move appears to be moving my knight to e4, which would put pressure on the center and potentially threaten White's position.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

I need to analyze this position carefully. 

As Black, I have a rook on b8, a bishop on c8, and my king on g8. I also have a knight on e4 which appears to be in a strong central position. White has a knight on a1 and b2, a rook on h6, and the white king is on e1.

Looking at my legal moves, I notice several important factors:
1. My knight on e4 has many possible moves
2. I need to be careful about the white rook on h6 which could be threatening my kingside
3. I should consider both defensive needs and potential attacking opportunities

The white rook on h6 seems to be putting pressure on my h7 pawn and potentially threatening my king. I should address this threat. Moving my king to h8 would be a solid defensive move to get out of any potential discovered attacks.

- White has knights on a8 and b6
- My king's position seems somewhat exposed

The knight on e4 is my most active piece and offers several tactical possibilities. I should consider whether I can use it to create threats or gain material.

One strong move would be to play e4f2+, forking White's king on e1 and potentially winning material. This would put White in check and force a response.

- My king is on h8 with a rook on b8 and bishop on c8
- White has a knight on a8 and another on b6, plus a rook on f6
- I have a knight on f2 that's attacking White's king on e4

Looking at my legal moves, the knight on f2 is particularly interesting as it's giving check to White's king. I should consider whether I can deliver a decisive blow or gain material advantage.

Among my options, the knight move f2h1 looks particularly strong as it would be a fork, attacking both White's king and potentially another piece. Let me make this move:

Now I can see the board position. Let me check what legal moves I have as Black.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

I can see the current position and my legal moves. Let me analyze the situation:

1. I'm playing as Black and my king is on g8
2. White has a rook on f6 which is putting pressure on my position
3. White has knights on a8 and b6, with the king on d3
4. I have a rook on b8, a bishop on c8, and a knight on h1

Looking at my options, I need to prioritize safety and development. The knight on h1 is out of play and could be developed with either h1g3 or h1f2. Moving g3 would develop the knight with a tempo, attacking White's pawn on a4.

I'll make this move:

You are a professional chess player and you play as black. Now is your turn to make a move. Before making a move you can pick one of the following actions:
- 'get_current_board' to get the schema and current status of the board
- 'get_legal_moves' to get a UCI formatted list of available moves
- 'make_move <UCI formatted move>' when you are ready to complete your turn (e.g., 'make_move e2e4')

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

I need to analyze the position carefully before making my move.

Looking at the board:
- I'm playing as Black with my king on h8
- White has a king on d3, a rook on f5, and knights on a1 and b6
- I have a rook on b8, a bishop on c8, a knight on g3, and several pawns
- My knight on g3 is attacking White's territory and has multiple options

The knight on g3 is my most active piece and has several good options. I can either:
1. Attack White's king with Ng3-e4+
2. Move my king to g7 to get it away from the back rank
3. Move my knight to h5 or f5 to maintain its active position

I think the check with the knight is the strongest move here.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Let me analyze the position:

I'm playing as Black and I have a knight on e4, a rook on b8, a bishop on c8, and my king on h8. White has knights on a1 and b6, a rook on f5, and the white king on e2.

Looking at my options, I notice my knight on e4 is very active and has many potential moves. I should consider if there are any tactical opportunities with it.

The move e4f6 looks strong as it attacks the white rook on f5. If I play Nf6, the rook would need to move, and I'd gain a tempo. This is a clear tactical opportunity.
