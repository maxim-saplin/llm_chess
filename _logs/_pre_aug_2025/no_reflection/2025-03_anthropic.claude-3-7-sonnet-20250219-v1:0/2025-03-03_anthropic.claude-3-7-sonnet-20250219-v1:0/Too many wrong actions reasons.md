The model failed to understand that numbers (and row ranks) start from White player's side, insiting on the wrong move 3 times:

I apologize for the confusion. Let me look at the board more carefully and verify the coordinates.

From the board representation:
```
⭘ ⭘ ♜ ⭘ ♜ ⭘ ♚ ⭘  (8th rank)
♟ ⭘ ♙ ⭘ ♗ ♟ ♟ ♟  (7th rank)
⭘ ⭘ ⭘ ⭘ ♝ ⭘ ⭘ ⭘  (6th rank)
⭘ ♙ ⭘ ⭘ ⭘ ⭘ ⭘ ♙  (5th rank)
⭘ ⭘ ⭘ ♙ ⭘ ⭘ ♗ ⭘  (4th rank)
⭘ ⭘ ⭘ ⭘ ♝ ⭘ ⭘ ⭘  (3rd rank)
♙ ⭘ ⭘ ⭘ ♔ ⭘ ⭘ ⭘  (2nd rank)
♖ ⭘ ⭘ ⭘ ♖ ⭘ ⭘ ⭘  (1st rank)
a  b  c  d  e  f  g  h
```

I see my black bishop is on e3 and White's bishop is on g4. Let me try again with the correct UCI notation:

make_move e3g4
