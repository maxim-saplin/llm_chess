You are a professional chess player and you play as black. Now is your turn to make a move. Before making a move you can pick one of the following actions:
- 'get_current_board' to get the schema and current status of the board
- 'get_legal_moves' to get a UCI formatted list of available moves
- 'make_move <UCI formatted move>' when you are ready to complete your turn (e.g., 'make_move e2e4')

I'll help you make a move as Black in this chess game. Let's first check the current board position.

I see the current position. White has played b2-b4, an unusual opening move known as the Sokolsky Opening or Polish Opening.

Let's check what legal moves I have as Black.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Now I can see all my legal moves. Since White has played 1.b4 (the Sokolsky Opening), I have several good responses.

One of the strongest replies is 1...e5, which immediately challenges the center and can lead to an advantage for Black if White captures with bxc5, as Black can develop quickly and gain the initiative.

Another solid response is 1...d5, establishing a strong central presence.

I'll go with the principled 1...e5 move, which is considered one of the best responses to the Sokolsky Opening.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Now I can see all my legal moves. Let me analyze the position:

White has played b4 and h4, which are somewhat unusual opening moves. As Black, I've already played e5, establishing a central presence.

For my next move, I want to focus on development and control of the center. The most principled moves would be to develop a knight to f6 or c6, or to develop the dark-squared bishop.

Knight to f6 (g8f6) is a solid classical move that develops a piece while controlling important central squares (e4 and d5). This is a standard developing move that follows good opening principles.

I'll make this move:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

After analyzing the position, I see that White has moved their rook to h6, which is threatening my h7 pawn. I need to respond to this threat.

The most direct response would be to defend the h7 pawn with h7h6, but that would weaken my kingside structure. 

A better move would be to develop my knight to c6, which develops a piece while preparing for castling queenside if needed. This is a standard developing move that improves my position.

I notice that White has developed the rook to c3, which is somewhat unusual. I should continue my development and strengthen my position. One of the best moves here would be to develop my dark-squared bishop to e7, which would protect my king and prepare for castling.

2. White has a rook on c3 that's attacking my c-file
3. I have knights on c6 and f6, bishops on e7 and c8
4. My king is still on e8

Castling kingside would be a good priority to improve my king safety. This is a standard developing move that will connect my rooks and bring my king to safety.

1. I'm playing as Black and my king is on g8
2. White has a rook on a3, which is unusual and suggests an early rook lift
3. White has captured one of my pieces (likely a bishop) and I've captured one of White's pawns on h8
4. My e-pawn has advanced to e5, and White has a pawn on h4

Looking at my options, I should prioritize development and king safety. I notice my light-squared bishop is already developed to e7, but my queenside is underdeveloped.

I'll develop my queenside by moving my queen's rook:

1. White has a rook on a7 attacking my b7 pawn
2. My king is on g8 with a rook on f8
3. I have knights on c6 and f6, bishops on e7 and b8
4. My e5 pawn is advanced

I should address the immediate threat to my b7 pawn. I can either defend it by playing b7b6 or move my knight to a7 to capture the rook.

The knight capture seems strongest as it eliminates White's active rook while developing my piece.

You are a professional chess player and you play as black. Now is your turn to make a move. Before making a move you can pick one of the following actions:
- 'get_current_board' to get the schema and current status of the board
- 'get_legal_moves' to get a UCI formatted list of available moves
- 'make_move <UCI formatted move>' when you are ready to complete your turn (e.g., 'make_move e2e4')

Player_Black (to Proxy):

I'll analyze the position and make a strategic move as Black.

Looking at the board, I notice:
- I have a standard pawn structure with knights developed
- My bishop on e7 is developed but somewhat blocked by my own pawns
- My knight on f6 is in a good central position
- White has a pawn on h4 that could potentially be dangerous

Among my options, I see several good candidate moves:

1. Castling with `g8h8` would secure my king's safety
2. Developing with `b8a8` would complete my rook development
3. Knight moves like `f6e4` could gain central control
4. Pawn advances like `e5e4` could claim more space

Castling is a priority in the opening/early middlegame, and my king is currently exposed in the center. Since kingside castling is available, I'll prioritize that.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

I need to analyze the position carefully before making my move.

Looking at the board, I notice:
- I'm playing as Black and have a standard piece setup
- White has pushed some pawns (a4, c3, d4, e4, f4, g4, h4)
- My e-pawn is advanced to e5
- Both kings appear to be uncastled
- I have knights on a7 and f6, bishops on e7 and b8

Among my options, I should prioritize development and king safety. Castling kingside would be a good move to protect my king.

I see I have the option to castle kingside with either h8g8 (0-0) or f8g8 (also notation for 0-0). This would connect my rooks and bring my king to safety.

- My king is on g8 with a rook on h8
- White has developed pieces including a knight on f3
- I have a knight on f6 that could be developed further
- My e7 bishop is pinned to my king by White's bishop on c5

Among my options, I see some strong developing moves:

1. Knight f6 to e4 looks strong, attacking the center
2. Castling (g8-f8 or g8-e8) would improve king safety
3. Developing the knight on a7 to c6 would strengthen my position

I'll choose to develop my knight to e4, which puts pressure on the center and creates threats.

After analyzing the position, I see several good options as Black. 

I notice I have two knights - one on a7 and one on e4. The e4 knight is particularly active and has several strong moves available. I also see that my dark-squared bishop on e7 has mobility.

Looking at the position strategically, the knight on e4 is very well placed and can potentially fork White's pieces. One particularly strong move is to play Ne4-f2+, which would fork White's king and rook.

I'll make this move:

make_move e4f2

After analyzing the position, I notice several key elements:

1. I have a knight on f2 that's deep in White's territory
2. White has an exposed king on e1
3. I have good development with both bishops and knights active

The knight on f2 is particularly interesting as it creates tactical opportunities. Looking at the legal moves, I see that this knight can deliver a fork.

I'll play:

make_move f2d1

This move attacks White's queen and rook simultaneously with my knight, creating a powerful fork. White will have to give up material, as they can't save both pieces. This is a strong tactical shot that should give me a significant advantage.

3. White has advanced a pawn to e5, controlling the center
4. I have a knight on d1 that appears to be deep in White's territory - this is unusual but could be advantageous

Looking at my options, I should prioritize development and king safety. The knight on d1 is already active, so I should consider:
1. Developing my other knight from a7
2. Continuing development with pawn moves
3. Potentially castling by moving my king

The knight on a7 to c6 looks like a strong developing move that controls central squares.

You are a professional chess player and you play as black. Now is your turn to make a move. Before making a move you can pick one of the following actions:
- 'get_current_board' to get the schema and current status of the board
- 'get_legal_moves' to get a UCI formatted list of available moves
- 'make_move <UCI formatted move>' when you are ready to complete your turn (e.g., 'make_move e2e4')

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

I can see all my legal moves now. Let me analyze the position:

1. I'm playing as Black and have a knight on e5 that's quite active
2. My king is on g8 with a rook on h8 and f8 missing (likely castled kingside)
3. White's king is on d1, somewhat exposed
4. Material appears roughly equal

Looking at my options, the knight on e5 is well-placed and could potentially create threats. I could consider:
- Developing my bishop on e7
- Creating threats with my knight on e5
- Advancing pawns to improve my position

I think one of the strongest moves is to develop my bishop to f6, which controls important diagonals and prepares for potential attacks.

I'll analyze the position and make a strategic move as Black.

Looking at the board:
- I have a knight on e5 that's well-positioned and attacking several squares
- My king is on g8 with a rook on h8
- White has a bishop on b4 that's attacking my queenside
- I need to continue development and ensure king safety

Among my options:
- Knight moves from e5 could maintain my strong central knight
- King safety moves like g8f8 might be prudent
- Developing moves with my queen or rooks could improve my position

After evaluation, I'll make a move:

- White has a bishop on b4 attacking my queenside
- My knight on c4 is active and has many options
- My king is on g8 with the rook on f8 missing (castled kingside)
- I have a knight on d1 deep in White's territory

The knight on d1 is particularly interesting - it's deep in enemy territory and could be a strong piece. I should consider using it effectively. The knight on c4 also has many good options.

After evaluating the available moves, I'll play my knight from d1 to c3, which attacks White's pawn on a2 and puts pressure on White's position.

One strong move I see is to capture that bishop with my knight:

make_move c4d6

This captures White's bishop on d7 with my knight from c4. This is a good move because:
1. I'm capturing a valuable piece (bishop)
2. The knight lands on d6, which is a strong central position
3. This removes the pressure White's bishop was putting on my kingside

After analyzing the position and available moves, I notice several important factors:

1. I have both knights developed and bishops active
2. My king is still in the center, and I have the option to castle kingside (e8g8)
3. White's king is exposed on b2, which could be exploitable

Castling kingside would be a priority to improve my king's safety. This is a standard and strong move that will connect my rooks and place my king in a safer position.

You are a professional chess player and you play as black. Now is your turn to make a move. Before making a move you can pick one of the following actions:
- 'get_current_board' to get the schema and current status of the board
- 'get_legal_moves' to get a UCI formatted list of available moves
- 'make_move <UCI formatted move>' when you are ready to complete your turn (e.g., 'make_move e2e4')

Player_Black (to Proxy):

I need to analyze the position carefully before making my move.

Looking at the board, I notice:
- I have two knights (on d6 and e4) that are well-positioned
- My dark-squared bishop on f6 is active
- My light-squared bishop on c8 is undeveloped
- White's king is exposed on b3

One of my strongest moves would be to develop my light-squared bishop with a check. This would improve my piece activity while putting pressure on White.

After analyzing the position and available moves, I notice I have several strong pieces in active positions. Let me evaluate my best options:

1. My king is on g8 with rooks on b8 and g8, suggesting I haven't castled yet.
2. I have knights on c3 and d6, bishops on e6 and f6, and my queen on d8.
3. White has some advanced pawns and appears to have castled queenside (king on b2).

One strong move would be to develop my bishop on e6 further with e6f5, putting pressure on the center and potentially threatening White's position.

3. I have several active pieces, particularly the bishop on f5 which has good diagonals

One of my strongest moves appears to be with my bishop on f5, which has multiple good options. I can either attack White's position or develop further tactical pressure.

I'll make a move with my bishop from f5 to e4, which puts pressure on the center, attacks the g2 square, and maintains good control of the diagonal.

3. My queen on d8 can improve her position

I think the most active move is to develop my bishop on g2 to a more aggressive position with:

make_move g2d5

This places my bishop on a strong central square, attacking the white pawn on b7 and controlling important central squares. This move increases my piece activity and puts pressure on White's position.

You are a professional chess player and you play as black. Now is your turn to make a move. Before making a move you can pick one of the following actions:
- 'get_current_board' to get the schema and current status of the board
- 'get_legal_moves' to get a UCI formatted list of available moves
- 'make_move <UCI formatted move>' when you are ready to complete your turn (e.g., 'make_move e2e4')

After analyzing the position and available moves, I notice several key factors:

1. I have two bishops, two knights, and both rooks still on the board
2. White's king is exposed on b2
3. I have a bishop on d5 that's attacking diagonally

Looking at the available moves, I see a powerful opportunity with my bishop on d5. I can deliver a check to White's king while also threatening material.

The knight on c3 has some active possibilities, and I also notice my bishop on f6 can make some good moves. My queen on d8 is also ready to be activated.

I'll play a strong developing move with my knight:

make_move c3e4

This knight move to e4 places my piece on a strong central square where it controls important squares and puts pressure on White's position. The knight on e4 can't be easily challenged and gives me good attacking prospects.

I notice a particularly strong move with my knight on c3: I can play c3e4, attacking White's bishop on e5 while also creating a fork threat against White's king and potentially other pieces.

This knight move creates a fork between White's king on b3 and the bishop on e5, winning material. Since the king must move, I'll be able to capture the bishop next move, gaining a significant advantage.

I can see that I'm playing as Black and have three legal moves available:

1. h8g7 - Moving my rook from h8 to g7
2. g8g7 - Moving my king from g8 to g7
3. f6g7 - Moving my bishop from f6 to g7

Looking at the board position:
- I have a pawn on g7 that appears to be under attack by a White pawn on g6
- I need to decide how to defend or address this situation

The best move here is to move my king to g7, which protects the pawn and improves my king's position. Moving the bishop to g7 would lose a piece for a pawn, and moving the rook to g7 would sacrifice a rook for a pawn, which is a poor trade.

After analyzing the position and available moves, I notice several key factors:

1. I have two knights - one on d6 and one on e4
2. My opponent's king is exposed on b4
3. I have a rook on g7 that could be developed

Looking at the knight on e4, I see it can attack the white king with a fork. The move e4c3 would put the king in check and also attack another piece.

After analyzing the position and available moves, I can see I'm playing as Black and have several interesting options.

I notice I have a knight on c3 that's very active in White's territory, and I have a potential checkmate threat with my queen on d8 and rook on g7. 

One of the strongest moves here appears to be:

make_move d8e8

This move aligns my queen with my king on the e-file, preparing for potential castling by hand (moving the king to g8 and rook to f8 in future moves). It maintains control of important squares while improving my queen's position. This also keeps pressure on White's position while maintaining my defensive structure.

2. White's king is exposed on a4
3. I have strong attacking pieces including a queen, two rooks, and active minor pieces

Looking at my legal moves, I notice I can create immediate threats against White's king. The most decisive move appears to be:

make_move d6e4

This knight move to e4 creates a powerful attack. It:
- Attacks White's king directly
- Cannot be captured (protected by my bishop on f6)
- Creates multiple threats and restricts White's king movement
- Sets up potential mating patterns with my queen and rooks

This move should lead to a winning advantage or immediate checkmate threats.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

After analyzing the position, I see several promising options:

1. I have a knight on c3 that can deliver a fork with `c3e2`, attacking both the white king on a4 and the rook on c2.
2. My bishop on f6 has several good moves.
3. I could also consider moves with my rooks or queen.

The most decisive move appears to be the knight fork:

make_move c3e2

This knight move creates a devastating fork - attacking both the white king on a4 and the white rook on c2. Since checking the king is mandatory for White to address, I'll be able to capture the rook on the next move. This is a clear material gain and a strong tactical shot.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

I need to analyze this position carefully. I'm playing as Black and have several interesting options.

Key observations:
- The white king is exposed on a4
- I have a knight on e2 that could be part of an attack
- My rooks on b8 and g7 could be activated
- My bishop on f6 controls important diagonals

Looking at the position, I notice my knight on e2 is well-placed and could potentially create threats. I also see that my queen on g7 and rook on b8 could coordinate for an attack.

One of the strongest moves appears to be moving my knight from e2 to c3, which creates a fork threat against the white king on a4 and another piece. This puts immediate pressure on White.

3. I have strong attacking pieces including my queen on g7 and rooks on b8 and g7

Looking at my legal moves, I notice I can create an immediate threat with my knight on c3. The move c3e4 looks particularly strong as it:
- Attacks White's pawn on b2 with a fork (threatening both the king and pawn)
- Creates a discovered attack with my bishop on f6
- Puts pressure on White's position

You are a professional chess player and you play as black. Now is your turn to make a move. Before making a move you can pick one of the following actions:
- 'get_current_board' to get the schema and current status of the board
- 'get_legal_moves' to get a UCI formatted list of available moves
- 'make_move <UCI formatted move>' when you are ready to complete your turn (e.g., 'make_move e2e4')

After analyzing the position, I see several key factors:

1. I have a queen on f8 and rooks on b8 and g7
2. My king is on g8, currently in the corner
3. I have a knight on c3 that could make some active moves
4. White's king is exposed on a3

Looking at my options, I notice I can make a strong move with my knight on c3. The knight on c3 can attack White's e2 square, which could be a good outpost or potentially fork pieces.

2. My queen on f8 has multiple options
3. I have a bishop on f6 that can be repositioned
4. My rook on g7 can be developed

The most critical aspect I notice is that my queen on f8 is currently blocking my rook on g7 from connecting with my king. Connecting my rooks would improve my position significantly.

I'll play:

make_move f8g8

This move accomplishes several things:
1. It clears the f8 square, allowing my rook on g7 to potentially connect with my other rook
2. It maintains queen protection of important squares
3. It keeps my king protected
4. It prepares for potential kingside operations

Looking at the position more carefully, I see that White's king is exposed on a4 with limited protection. My knight on e3 can deliver a powerful fork by moving to c4, which would attack both the white king and the pawn on a5.

I notice I have a knight on e3 that's very active, a bishop on f6, and my rooks and queen are well positioned. White's king is exposed on b4 with limited protection.

One of the strongest moves I see is to attack White's king with my knight:

make_move e3c2

This knight move to c2 creates a powerful attack. It threatens White's king directly while being protected by my bishop on f6. This forces White to respond to the immediate threat and gives me a strong attacking position.

After analyzing the position and the available legal moves, I'll make my decision.

The position shows I'm playing as Black and I have material advantage with a queen, two rooks, a bishop, and a knight against White's king, bishop, and two pawns. White's king is exposed on c3, which presents tactical opportunities.

My knight on c2 is attacking White's king, creating a check. This is a critical tactical moment. I should capitalize on this check to improve my position further.

The best move is to capture the pawn on a4 with my knight while maintaining the check:

I'll play the knight move that forks the white king and pawn:

This move attacks both the white king on b4 and the pawn on a4 simultaneously, creating a tactical threat. White will be forced to move the king, allowing me to capture the pawn on the next move, gaining material advantage.

After analyzing the position, I see several strong options as Black. I have a significant material advantage with a queen, two rooks, a bishop, and a knight against just a king and two pawns.

I notice my knight on e1 is attacking the white king on b4, which is an important tactical resource. I also have my queen on g7 and rooks on b8 and g7 that can be coordinated for an attack.

One of the strongest moves is to bring my queen into the attack with:

make_move g7g4

This move puts pressure on the a4 pawn while maintaining control of key squares. The queen on g4 creates threats along the 4th rank and g-file, restricting the white king's movement and preparing for a coordinated attack with my other pieces.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

After analyzing the position and available moves, I see several strong options:

1. The white king is exposed on c3, which gives me tactical opportunities
2. I have a rook on g4 that can attack along the g-file or 4th rank
3. My bishop on f6 controls important diagonals

The most decisive move appears to be:

make_move g4g2

This threatens checkmate on g1 next move. If White tries to block with a piece on g3, I can capture it and still maintain the mating threat. This is a powerful attacking move that should lead to a winning position.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

After analyzing the position and the legal moves, I see a clear winning move. I have a knight on e1 that can deliver a devastating fork.

make_move e1f3

This knight move to f3 creates a fork attacking both the white king on d4 and the white pawn on a4 simultaneously. Since the king is in check, White must move the king, and I'll be able to capture the a4 pawn next move. This is a classic knight fork tactic that will win material while maintaining my already significant advantage.

Looking at the legal moves, I see an opportunity for a decisive attack. The knight on d4 can deliver a fork by moving to e2, attacking both White's king and potentially another piece.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

After analyzing the position and legal moves, I can see that I have a winning advantage as Black. The most decisive move appears to be:

make_move e2c3

This knight move captures White's king, which is an immediate checkmate. In a real chess game, the previous move by White would have been illegal if it left the king in check, but based on the current board position and legal moves provided, this capture is available and ends the game immediately.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

After analyzing the position and available moves, I see several strong options. I notice I'm playing against a white king on c3, and I have multiple pieces that could deliver check or create threats.

The most powerful move appears to be using my rook on d4 to attack the white king's position. I can create an immediate threat with:

make_move d4c4

This move attacks the white king directly, forcing it to move. If the king moves to b3, I can follow up with my knight on c3 moving to a4 or a2, maintaining pressure. If the king moves to d3, my rook still controls the 4th rank. This move gives me the initiative while maintaining my material advantage.

I notice that my knight on c3 is active and can create threats. One particularly strong move is to attack the white king with my knight:

make_move c3e2

This knight move to e2 creates a direct check on the white king on c3. It's a strong tactical move that forces White to respond to the check, giving me the initiative. This also potentially sets up future tactics involving my bishop on f6 and queen on g8.

The most powerful move I see is the knight fork from e2 to g3, which would attack both the white king on c3 and potentially another piece. This is a decisive tactical opportunity.

- I have pawns on f6 and h7

Key observations:
- My knight on e4 is attacking White's bishop on d4
- I should consider potential checks or attacking opportunities
- Need to ensure my king's safety

After evaluating the position, I see that my knight on e4 can capture White's bishop on d4, which would be a material gain with no immediate drawbacks.

Key observations:
- White's rook on b8 is threatening my king on the 8th rank
- I need to address this immediate threat

Best moves to consider:
1. g8f8 - Moving my king away from the rook's attack
2. d6b7 - Knight move that attacks the rook
3. g7b2 - Queen takes White's king (if this is legal, it would be checkmate)

Since g7b2 isn't in the legal moves list, I'll choose the knight move to attack the rook:

Player_Black (to Proxy):

I can see all my legal moves now. Let me analyze the position:

I'm playing as Black and have a queen on g8, king on h8, knight on b7, bishop on f6, and pawns on f7 and h7. White has a rook on b8, king on b5, and bishop on c5.

Looking at the position, I notice:
1. My queen is under attack by the white rook on b8
2. I need to protect my queen or move it to safety
3. I could consider a check with my bishop

The best move appears to be moving my queen away from the rook's attack while maintaining control of important squares.

2. White has a king on a4, rook on b8, and bishop on c4

I notice I have a direct checkmate opportunity. My queen on f8 can capture the rook on b8, delivering checkmate since the white king on a4 would have no escape squares and no way to block or capture.

Looking at my legal moves, I see several strong options:

1. I could move my queen to checkmate White's king with `b8a8`
2. I could move my bishop to deliver check with several moves like `f6d4+`

The best move is clearly to deliver checkmate and end the game immediately.

1. I could check the White king with my bishop (f6c3)
2. I could move my queen to create threats
3. I could develop my pieces to better positions

The most immediate threat appears to be checking the White king with my bishop, which would force a response and give me initiative.

- My queen is on a8
- I have a knight on b7
- I have pawns on f7 and h7
- White has a king on c3 and a bishop on a7

Looking at the legal moves, I notice I can potentially deliver checkmate. The white king is on c3 with limited mobility, and my queen can attack from a distance.

I'll move my queen to deliver checkmate:

- I can also consider developing my queen to a more active position

The move Qc2+ puts immediate pressure on White's king and forces a response. This is a strong tactical move that gives me the initiative.

1. I have a king on g8 that can move to g7
2. A knight on b7 that can move to d8, d6, c5, or a5
3. Pawns on f7 and h7 that can advance one or two squares

Looking at this endgame position, I need to consider:
- My material advantage (knight and two pawns vs bishop)
- Advancing my pawns toward promotion
- King safety and activity

The most principled approach is to advance one of my pawns toward promotion. Since the h-pawn is not immediately threatened, and advancing the f-pawn would help control the g5 square:

I see the position now. As Black, I have:
- My king on h8 with possible moves to g8 and g7
- A knight on b7 that can move to d8, d6, c5, or a5
- Pawns on h7 and f5, which can advance

Let me analyze the position:
- White has a king on c2 and a bishop on f1
- I need to consider safety of my king and potential threats

The most important priority is king safety. Moving my king to g7 would expose it to potential checks from the bishop. Moving to g8 keeps it safer.

The knight on b7 has several options. Moving it to d6 would be a central square with good control.

I'll move my knight to d6, which improves my piece activity and controls important central squares.

You are a professional chess player and you play as black. Now is your turn to make a move. Before making a move you can pick one of the following actions:
- 'get_current_board' to get the schema and current status of the board
- 'get_legal_moves' to get a UCI formatted list of available moves
- 'make_move <UCI formatted move>' when you are ready to complete your turn (e.g., 'make_move e2e4')

I can see the current position. I'm playing as Black and I have a king on h8, a pawn on h7, a knight on d6, and a pawn on f5. White has a king on c2 and a bishop on h3.

Let me check what legal moves I have available.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Now I can see my legal moves. Let me analyze the position:

1. I need to be careful about the white bishop on h3, which is controlling the diagonal a10-h3.
2. My king is on h8 and can move to g8 or g7.
3. My knight on d6 has several options.
4. I have pawns on h7 and f5 that can advance.

Looking at the position, I should consider:
- The bishop on h3 isn't directly threatening any of my pieces right now
- My knight on d6 could potentially move to f7 to protect the h7 pawn and be closer to my king
- Advancing my f5 pawn could gain space

After evaluation, I think the best move is to bring my knight closer to my king while protecting the h7 pawn.

I see the current position and my legal moves. Let me analyze the situation:

I'm playing as Black and have:
- King on h8
- Knight on f7
- Pawns on h7 and f5
- White has a King on c2 and a Bishop on g1

Looking at my options:
1. Moving my king (h8g8, h8g7) - generally good to keep the king safe
2. Moving my knight (f7d8, f7h6, f7d6, f7g5, f7e5) - need to consider knight's activity
3. Moving my pawns (h7h6, h7h5, f5f4) - pawn advances can create space

The best move appears to be h8g7, moving my king away from the edge of the board and toward the center. This improves king activity while maintaining safety, as there are no immediate threats.

I need to analyze this endgame position carefully. 

I have a king on g7, a knight on f7, and pawns on h7 and f5. White has a king on d3 and a bishop on g7.

This is a very simplified position where I need to be careful about my king's safety while trying to advance my pawns if possible. The h-pawn is particularly important as a potential promotion candidate.

Looking at the legal moves, I should consider:
1. King safety - avoiding checks and maintaining position
2. Advancing the h-pawn when safe
3. Using my knight effectively

I'll advance my h-pawn to create a passed pawn threat:

- King on d3
- Bishop on f3

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Now I can see all my legal moves. Let me analyze the position:

I'm playing as Black with a material advantage (knight and two pawns vs bishop). My goal should be to advance my pawns while keeping my king safe and using my knight effectively.

Looking at the position:
1. My f5 pawn is ready to advance to f4, which would be a strong move toward promotion
2. My knight on f7 can control important squares
3. My king is relatively safe on g7

The best move here is to advance my f-pawn:

I notice there's a typo in the legal moves list - it shows "h5h4" but looking at the board, there's already a black pawn on h4, not h5.

Let me analyze this position:

1. My king on g7 has several safe moves
2. My knight on f7 can move to various squares
3. I need to be careful about the white bishop on f3 which controls diagonals

The most important factors here are:
- Advancing my pawns when safe
- Coordinating my pieces
- Keeping my king safe

I'll move my knight to e5, which:
- Centralizes the knight
- Puts pressure on more squares
- Potentially threatens to fork white pieces later

Given the material equality (both sides have a minor piece plus pawns), creating a passed pawn seems like a good strategic choice. The f3 pawn would be protected by my knight from e5, and it would put pressure on White's position.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

I see my legal moves now. Let me analyze the position:

I notice I have a knight on e5 and my opponent has a bishop on e2. I also see I can capture White's pawn on h4 with my pawn from h5 (h5h4 is in the legal moves list).

Looking at the knight moves, I should consider if any of them create threats or improve my position. The move Ne5-f7 would block my king's escape square, so that's not good. The move Ne5-g4 looks interesting as it attacks White's pawn on f6.

Wait, there seems to be some inconsistency in the board representation and legal moves. The board shows a pawn on f3, but the legal moves include f3e2 and f3f2, suggesting I control that pawn. Also, the board shows a pawn on h4 (White's), but the legal moves include h5h4, suggesting I have a pawn on h5 that can capture it.

Based on the legal moves provided, I'll make what appears to be the strongest move - capturing the pawn on h4:

I'm playing as Black with a king on g7 and a knight on e5. I also control two white pawns (h4 and f3) that can be moved.

Looking at the available moves, I notice my knight on e5 can capture the bishop on d3. This is a clear material gain and should be my best move.

Now I can see all my legal moves. Let me analyze the position:

I have my king on g7, a knight on d3, and pawns on f3 and h4. White's king is on f1.

Looking at my options:
- I can advance my f-pawn with f3-f2, putting pressure on White's king
- My knight has several moves, including Nd3-f2 which would attack White's king
- I can move my king in various directions
- I can advance my h-pawn with h4-h3

The most forcing move appears to be Nd3-f2, directly attacking White's king. This is a check that will force White to respond, and it controls important squares around White's king.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Now I understand my options. Let me analyze the position:

I have my king on g7, a knight on f2, and pawns on f3 and h4. White's king is on e1, far away from my pieces.

Strategic considerations:
1. My knight on f2 is very active and close to White's king
2. I should look for a move that improves my position or creates threats
3. The h4 pawn could be advanced to promote eventually

The knight moves deserve special attention since they could create tactical threats. Let me examine the knight options:
- f2g4: Knight moves to g4, controlling e3 and h2
- f2e4: Knight moves to e4, controlling d2, f2, and g3
- f2h3: Knight moves to h3, controlling g1 and f4
- f2d3: Knight moves to d3, controlling e1 (checks the king), b2, and f4
- f2h1: Knight moves to h1, in the corner
- f2d1: Knight moves to d1, next to the enemy king

The move f2d3+ stands out as it gives check to the white king. This is clearly the strongest move as it forces the white king to move and gains tempo.

- Black king on g7
- Black knight on d6
- Black pawns on f6 and h4
- White king on f1

Let me check what legal moves I have as Black.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

I notice there's a discrepancy in the board representation and the legal moves. The board shows a knight on d6, but the legal moves suggest a knight on d3. Also, there's a pawn move f3f2 listed, but the board shows a pawn on f6, not f3.

Let me analyze the actual legal moves provided:

Looking at the knight moves (d3e5, d3c5, etc.), it appears my knight is actually on d3, not d6 as shown in the board visualization.

Among my options:
- The knight has several good moves
- I can advance my h-pawn with h4h3
- I can advance a pawn with f3f2 (though this pawn appears to be on f6 in the visualization)
- I have several king moves available

The most promising move appears to be f3f2, which would advance a pawn close to promotion. If this is indeed a pawn on f3 (not f6 as shown), this would be a strong move threatening promotion.

I notice there's a discrepancy in the board representation and the legal moves. The board shows my knight on d5, but the legal moves suggest it's on d3. Also, I see White has a pawn on h4 that can move to h3, and a pawn on f2 that can promote.

Looking at this position strategically, I have several good options:

1. I could move my knight to f4, which would attack White's king on g2 and the pawn on h3
2. I could move my king to safety and prepare for the endgame
3. I could capture White's f2 pawn if it's in range of my knight

Based on the legal moves available, I'll choose to move my knight to f4, putting White's king in check and threatening the pawn.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

I need to carefully analyze this position. I'm playing as Black and have several pieces: a king on g7, a knight on f4, and a pawn on f2 (which is ready to promote) and h4.

Looking at the White pieces, there's a king on h1 and a pawn on h4.

The most powerful move available is promoting my f2 pawn to a queen with f2f1q. This would give me a decisive material advantage and likely lead to a quick checkmate.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

I see all my available moves now. Since White has played 1.a3, which is a somewhat passive opening move, I'll respond with a strong central pawn move to claim space in the center.

The move 1...e5 (e7e5) is a solid classical response that stakes a claim in the center, develops quickly, and opens lines for both the bishop and queen. This is a standard response that follows good opening principles.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

After analyzing the position and my available legal moves, I'll make my decision.

The position shows we're in the early opening phase. White has moved their knight to h3 and pawn to a3, while I've developed my knight to f6 and pushed my e-pawn to e5.

I should continue with sound development. One of the strongest principles in chess openings is to control the center and develop pieces efficiently. The move Bb4+ (bishop from f8 to b4) looks particularly appealing as it:
1. Develops a piece
2. Puts pressure on White's position with a check
3. Follows opening principles

Looking at the position:
- I have castling available (e8g8)
- My bishop on b4 is active and pinning White's knight on c3
- I have a knight on f6 that can make several moves
- My pawn structure is intact

One of the strongest moves here would be to castle kingside, which would bring my king to safety and connect my rooks.

After analyzing the position and available moves, I can see several good options. 

The most natural development move would be to play Nc6 (b8c6), developing the knight and controlling the center. This is a standard move in many openings.

Another strong option is to play Bc5 (b4c5), repositioning the bishop to a more active diagonal where it puts pressure on White's kingside.

Given the position, I'll choose to develop my knight to c6, which supports the e5 pawn and improves my piece activity.

After analyzing the position, I see I'm playing as Black with a fairly developed position. I notice my bishop on b4 is attacking White's queenside, and I have knights on c6 and f6 in active positions.

Looking at the legal moves, I see several strong options:
- I could develop my bishop with Bf8 (b4f8)
- I could play Nd4 (c6d4) attacking the center
- I could castle with O-O (g8h8)

Castling is a priority in the opening/early middlegame to secure king safety, and I see that my king is still in the center. Since the kingside is relatively clear and castling is available, I'll choose to castle kingside.

After analyzing the position, I see several good options as Black. I notice I have castling available (e8g8), which would secure my king's safety. I also have active pieces with my knights and bishops.

Given that my king is still in the center and White has developed their pieces, castling kingside would be a priority to improve my king's safety and connect my rooks.

I notice my king is on g8 and I have a bishop on b4 that's actively placed. White's queen is on g2, which could be a threat along the g-file or the b7-h1 diagonal.

One strong move would be to develop my bishop from b4 to e7, which protects my king, develops a piece, and prepares for castling.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

I can see all my legal moves now. Let me analyze the position:

1. I'm playing as Black and the position appears to be in the middle game.
2. My king is on g8 and seems safe for now.
3. I have knights on c6 and f6, bishops on e7 and c8, and a queen on d8.
4. White has pushed the e-pawn to e5, creating some space in the center.

Looking at my options, I should focus on development and controlling the center. My light-squared bishop on c8 is still undeveloped, and I could improve my piece coordination.

I'll develop my bishop with:

make_move e7c5

This move develops my bishop to an active diagonal where it puts pressure on White's position. The bishop on c5 controls important central squares and could potentially target White's kingside. This is a natural developing move that improves my position.

- I have knights on c6 and f6 in good positions

Among my options, I see several priorities:
1. Castle to safety (g8f8 or g8e8)
2. Develop my rook on a8
3. Challenge White's e5 pawn with my knights
4. Continue developing my pieces

I'll castle kingside to ensure my king's safety, which is a priority in this middlegame position.

2. Playing d7d5 to challenge White's center
3. Developing my light-squared bishop with c5e3, putting pressure on White's position

After consideration, I'll castle kingside to improve my king's safety and connect my rooks.

I'm playing as Black and have a fairly developed position with knights on c6 and f6, bishops on c5 and c8, and my queen on d8. My king is still on g8, and I haven't castled yet.

Looking at the available moves, I notice several strong options:
- I could develop my bishop with c5e3, attacking White's queen
- I could play c5f2+, forking White's king and rook
- I could castle with g8f8 or g8e8
- I could develop my light-squared bishop with c8e6

The move c5f2+ stands out as particularly strong - it's a check that also attacks White's rook on a2. This would win material.

After analyzing the position, I see several interesting options. I notice my bishop on g3 is attacking the white queen on h2, and I have knights on c6 and f6 that could be developed further.

The most striking feature is my bishop on g3 which is putting pressure on the white queen on h2. However, I don't see the white queen on h2 - it appears to be on h5 according to the board display. Let me reconsider my options.

I see my bishop on g3 is actually threatening the white queen on h4 (though the board shows it on h5). This is a powerful tactical opportunity. I should capture the queen with my bishop.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

After analyzing the position, I notice several important features:
- My king is on g8 with the rook on h8, so castling kingside is an option
- I have a bishop on h4 that's actively placed and threatening the white queen on h2
- White's rook on g4 is somewhat aggressive
- I have knights on c6 and f6 that could be developed further

One of my strongest moves appears to be the bishop on h4 threatening White's queen. I can either capture something valuable or improve my position.

Looking at the bishop on h4, I see it can move to g3, threatening the white queen even more directly, or to f2 which would be a fork between the king and rook.

I'll play the bishop move to f2, creating a powerful fork between White's king and rook.

2. I have a bishop on f2 that's actively placed and could be developed further
3. My king position needs attention

The bishop on f2 seems particularly strong and has several good options. I'll use it to attack White's queen on h4, which creates a powerful threat.

Looking at the board:
- I have a bishop on h4 that's attacking the white queen on h2
- My knights are on c6 and f6, with potential development opportunities
- The white queen is on h2, which seems exposed
- I have a bishop on h4 that could be threatened

One of my strongest options appears to be Bh4xf2+, which would capture a bishop while giving check. This would force the king to move and gain material.

I can strengthen this pressure by moving it to g3, which would attack White's rook on g1 if it were there (though I see it's on h1 currently), while maintaining influence on the center.

One of my strongest moves appears to be leveraging my bishop on e1, which is aimed at White's kingside. I can also consider defending my e5 pawn which is under attack.

After evaluating the options, I'll make a move with my bishop on e1, which is creating significant pressure.

You are a professional chess player and you play as black. Now is your turn to make a move. Before making a move you can pick one of the following actions:
- 'get_current_board' to get the schema and current status of the board
- 'get_legal_moves' to get a UCI formatted list of available moves
- 'make_move <UCI formatted move>' when you are ready to complete your turn (e.g., 'make_move e2e4')

After analyzing the position, I see several interesting options:

1. My bishop on f2 is attacking White's bishop on e1 and has several good diagonal moves
2. I have knights on c6 and f6 that can be developed
3. My king is castled but I need to be careful about White's rook on g4

I'll choose to capture White's bishop with my bishop:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

I need to analyze this position carefully. 

Looking at the board, I notice:
- White has a rook on g4 threatening my e-pawn
- I have two bishops (c8 and e1), two knights (c6 and f6), and my queen is on d8
- White's king is on c2, somewhat exposed
- My king is on g8

Among my legal moves, I see several good options:

1. I could defend the e5 pawn with `f6e4` or `f6d5`
2. I could develop my dark-squared bishop with `c8e6` (but that's not in the legal moves list, so it must be blocked)
3. I could move my queen to protect the e5 pawn with `d8e7`
4. I could consider the bishop on e1, which appears to be well-positioned on the long diagonal

After evaluating these options, I think the best move is to defend my e5 pawn while developing a piece. The knight move to d5 looks strong as it defends the pawn and puts pressure in the center.

One of the most critical moves appears to be moving my king out of the file where White's rook is positioned. This would prevent any immediate threats along the g-file.

After analyzing the position and legal moves, I notice several key aspects:

1. My king is on h8 with a rook on f8, suggesting I haven't castled yet
2. White has a rook on g7 that's attacking my g7 pawn
3. I have a bishop on f2 that's deep in White's position
4. I have knights on c6 and d5 in active positions

The bishop on f2 is particularly strong and threatens White's position. I should capitalize on this advantage.

One of the strongest moves appears to be:

make_move f2e3

This move attacks White's king on d4 and the pawn on c5 simultaneously. If White captures the bishop with the pawn, I can recapture with my knight from d5, maintaining pressure. This move creates immediate tactical threats while developing my position.

After analyzing the position, I see several interesting options. The white rook on g7 is attacking my pawn on g7, so I need to address that threat. I also notice my bishop on e3 is well-positioned and could potentially deliver a strong move.

Looking at the position more carefully, I see that my bishop on e3 can capture the white bishop on d2 with a check. This would force the white king to move and give me the initiative.

I see the current board position. White has just captured on g7 with a rook, putting my king in check. Let me check my legal moves to respond to this check.

g8h8,g8g7

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

I see that I have only two legal moves to respond to the check:
1. g8h8 - Moving my king to the h8 corner
2. g8g7 - Capturing the white rook on g7 with my king

Let me analyze these options:

If I play g8h8, I'm moving my king to the corner which could be dangerous as it limits escape squares. 

If I play g8g7, I capture the white rook which eliminates the immediate threat. This seems like the better option as I gain material (capturing a rook) while also addressing the check.

I'll capture the rook:

After analyzing the position and available moves, I notice several key factors:

1. I have a bishop on d2 that's actively placed on the long diagonal
2. My king on g7 is relatively safe
3. I have knights on c6 and d5 that could be developed further
4. My queen on d8 has several possible moves

One strong move would be to develop my rook to e8, connecting my rooks and controlling the open e-file:

Looking at the board, I notice:
- My king is on g7 with some pawn protection
- I have a bishop on d2 that's actively placed
- There's a knight on c6
- White has a bishop on e5 that could be threatening
- The d4 pawn is isolated and could be a target

One strong move I see is to use my bishop on d2 to attack White's kingside. The move d2f4 looks particularly strong as it attacks White's f2 pawn and puts pressure on the kingside.

4. The position appears somewhat open

Among my options, I notice I can develop my knight on c6 to more active squares, continue developing my rooks, or improve my bishop position.

One strong move is to develop my knight to d4, which attacks White's pawn on c2 and puts pressure in the center. This knight would be well-placed on d4.

After analyzing the position, I can see I'm playing as Black and have several good options. 

I notice my king is on g7, and I have two bishops (on c8 and f5) and a knight on f4. White has a bishop on e5 that's currently attacking my knight on f4.

Key considerations:
- I should address the threat to my knight on f4
- I could develop my pieces further or improve my king's safety
- The bishop on f5 is well-placed, attacking White's position

After evaluating the options, I'll move my knight from f4 to e6, which:
1. Moves it away from the bishop's attack
2. Places it in a central, strong position
3. Protects my pawn on d8
4. Maintains pressure on White's position

After analyzing the position, I see several interesting options. I notice my king is on g7, and I have a bishop on g3 that could be vulnerable but also active. The knight on f5 is well-placed and has several good options.

Looking at the position strategically, I should consider improving my pieces or addressing any immediate threats. The bishop on g3 is particularly active, controlling the long diagonal, so I want to maintain that advantage.

One strong move would be to develop my knight further with:

make_move f5d4

This knight move to d4 creates pressure in the center, attacks White's c2 pawn, and places my knight on a strong central square where it can't be easily attacked. From d4, the knight controls important squares and contributes to my control of the center.

After analyzing the position and available moves, I can see I'm playing as Black and have several interesting options. 

The position appears to be in the middle game with some pieces already exchanged. I notice my king is on g7, and I have the option to castle on the kingside (e8g8), which is often a good way to improve king safety.

I also see I have two bishops (on g3 and c8) and a knight on f3 that has some active squares available. My queen is still on d8.

Given the position, I'll castle kingside to improve my king's safety and connect my rooks:

I notice I'm playing as Black and the position is quite complex. Looking at the board:

1. My king is on g7
2. I have a knight on d4 that has several good options
3. I have a bishop on g3 that's active
4. White has a knight on d6 that's centralized

Among my options:
- The knight on d4 has many potential moves, including the strong e6 square which would attack White's position
- My bishop on g3 can move to various squares
- I could also consider king safety moves

The knight move d4e6 looks particularly strong as it:
- Centralizes my knight further
- Attacks potential squares around White's position
- Creates tactical threats

Looking at my options, developing my rook from a8 to b8 would be a solid move to connect my rooks. Another strong option is to activate my knight on e6 by moving it to c5 or f4, putting pressure on White's position.

I'll choose to move my knight to c5, which attacks White's pawn on d7 while developing to a strong central square.

- I have a knight on c5 that has several good options
- I have a bishop on g3 that's actively placed
- White has a knight on d8 that's attacking my rook on a8

One of my strongest moves appears to be moving my knight from c5 to e4, which would attack White's center pawns and improve my knight's position.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

I'll analyze the position and make a strong move as Black.

Looking at the board, I notice:
- I'm playing as Black with my king on g7
- White has a knight on d8 that's attacking my position
- I have a knight on e4 with several options
- I have a bishop on g3 that's active
- My rook on a8 is blocked by my own pawn

Among my options:
- The knight on e4 has several strong moves, including f2 which would attack White's king on d4
- I could move my king to safety with g7h6 or g7f8
- I could develop my rook with g8h8 or a8b8

The strongest move appears to be using my knight to attack White's king:

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Let me analyze the position and my available moves:

I notice I'm playing as Black and my king is on g7. White has a knight on d8 that's checking my king, so I must address this check immediately.

Looking at my legal moves, I have several options to deal with the check:
1. Move my king: g7h8, g7f8, g7h6, or g7f6
2. Capture the knight: Not possible
3. Block the check: Not possible

Let me evaluate these king moves:
- g7h8: Moves to the corner which can be restrictive
- g7f8: Moves toward the center but might be exposed
- g7h6: Moves to the edge of the board
- g7f6: Moves toward the center and gives the king more mobility

I also notice I have a knight on f2 that's quite active and a bishop on g3 that could develop an attack.

After evaluation, I believe g7f6 is the best move as it moves my king toward the center, giving it more mobility and escape squares.

I need to analyze the position carefully before making my move.

Looking at the board, I notice:
- I'm playing as Black with my king on f6
- White has a knight on d8 that's attacking my position
- I have a bishop on g3 that could be developed better
- My rook on g8 is undefended and could be activated

Among my legal moves, I see several strong options:

1. `g8g7` - Activating my rook to the 7th rank could be useful
2. `f6g7` - Moving my king to safety
3. `g3h4` - Repositioning my bishop

The knight on d8 is a concern, but it doesn't appear to be an immediate threat. I think the best move is to improve my king's position by moving it to g7, which also protects my rook.

Looking at the current position, I need to make a strategic decision as Black. 

I notice several important features of the position:
- My king is on g7 and appears somewhat exposed
- I have a knight on f2 that's actively placed in White's territory
- I have a bishop on g3 that's also well-positioned
- White has a knight on d8 that's threatening my position

Among my options, I see some strong candidate moves:

1. Knight moves from f2 - particularly f2d3 looks active and could threaten White's pieces
2. King safety moves like g7h8 or g7f8
3. Developing my rook with a8b8

After evaluating the position, I believe improving my king's safety is important while maintaining my active pieces.

The best move appears to be capturing the knight with my knight, which removes the checking piece and gives me a material advantage.

4. White has a knight on d8 that's somewhat awkwardly placed

Among my options, I see a strong move with my bishop on g3. I can capture White's bishop on d3, which would eliminate an important piece and improve my position.

I apologize for the error. Let me check the legal moves again and make a valid move.

Looking at the board more carefully, I see that what I thought was a bishop on d3 is actually White's bishop. My bishop is on g3, and I need to select a legal move from the list provided.

Let me choose a strong move from the available options. The knight on d6 has several good options, and moving it to f5 would put pressure on White's position while developing toward the kingside.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

After analyzing the position, I can see I'm playing as Black and need to make a move. Let me evaluate the key aspects of the position:

1. Material: The position appears roughly equal with some piece exchanges having occurred
2. King safety: My king on g8 seems reasonably safe
3. Piece activity: I notice my bishop on g3 is actively placed, attacking the white kingside
4. Tactical opportunities: I should check if there are any immediate tactics

Looking at my legal moves, I see that my bishop on g3 has several interesting options. The most promising appears to be Bh2+, which would give check to the White king on c1 and potentially create some tactical opportunities.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

After analyzing the position, I notice several important factors:

1. My king on f8 is in check from White's knight on d8
2. I need to address this check immediately
3. I have several options to deal with the check:
   - Move my king (f8e8, f8g7, f8e7)
   - Capture the knight (not possible)
   - Block the check (not possible)

Looking at my king moves:
- f8e8 moves to the queenside where White has a rook on b1
- f8g7 moves diagonally but could be vulnerable to other attacks
- f8e7 moves to a relatively safer square

After careful consideration, I'll move my king to e7, which seems to be the safest response to the check.

After analyzing the position and my legal moves, I'll make a decision.

The position is complex with material roughly equal. I notice my king is on e7 and there's a white knight on d8 that's checking me. I need to address this check immediately.

Looking at my options to get out of check:
- I can capture the knight with e7xd8
- I can move my king to f8, e8, or f6

Taking the knight with e7xd8 seems strongest as it removes the checking piece and gains material. This is a clear choice.

The position appears to be in the middlegame with material roughly equal. I notice my bishop on g3 is actively placed, attacking the white kingside. My knight on f5 is also well positioned. White's king is on d3, which could be vulnerable.

Looking at my options:
- I have a bishop on g3 that's attacking the white kingside
- My knight on f5 is well-placed and has several potential moves
- I need to consider both attacking opportunities and improving my position

One strong move would be to play g3h2, attacking White's g-pawn with my bishop while maintaining pressure on the kingside. This move threatens to win material.

After analyzing the position, I see several interesting options:

1. I have a bishop on h2 that's attacking the white king on d6
2. I have a knight on g3 with several potential moves
3. My rooks on a8 and g8 can be developed

The most critical aspect is that my bishop on h2 is delivering check to the white king. I need to decide whether to continue the attack or make another strong move.

Since the bishop is already giving check, White will have to respond to it, so I should look for the most advantageous follow-up. The knight on g3 has some good options, particularly e4 which would attack the d2 square near the white king.

I'll make this move:

You are a professional chess player and you play as black. Now is your turn to make a move. Before making a move you can pick one of the following actions:
- 'get_current_board' to get the schema and current status of the board
- 'get_legal_moves' to get a UCI formatted list of available moves
- 'make_move <UCI formatted move>' when you are ready to complete your turn (e.g., 'make_move e2e4')

Player_Black (to Proxy):

After analyzing the position, I see several key elements:

1. I have a knight on e4 with multiple potential moves
2. I have a bishop on h2 that's active on the long diagonal
3. White has a bishop on h7 threatening my kingside
4. My king is on d8 with some mobility

The knight on e4 is well-placed and could potentially fork pieces. The bishop on h2 is also strong on that diagonal. I notice my king could use some breathing room.

I'll play a knight move that improves my position and creates threats:

I can see that I have a very limited set of legal moves as Black. Let me analyze the position:

1. I can move my king from d8 to either e8 or e7
2. I can move a pawn from f7 to e6
3. I can move a pawn from d7 to e6

Looking at the position, my king appears to be in check from White's bishop on h6. I need to address this immediately. Moving the king to e8 seems safest as it gets out of the check while maintaining protection from my rook on h8.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

I need to analyze this position carefully. 

Looking at the board, I notice:
- I'm playing as Black with my king on e8
- White has a knight on d4 threatening my e-pawn
- I have a bishop on h2 that's quite active
- My knight on f6 has several options
- White's king appears to be on c2

Let me consider my best options:

1. The bishop on h2 is very active and could deliver a strong move with h2g1, potentially threatening White's rook on a1
2. My e5 pawn is under attack from White's knight on d4
3. I could develop my rook with g8f8 or a8b8

After evaluating these options, I believe the strongest move is to use my bishop's excellent position:

I'll analyze the position as Black:

The position looks complex with material appearing roughly equal. I notice my king is on e8 and I have a bishop on g1 that's attacking White's position. I also have a knight on f6 that could be developed further.

Looking at my options:
- I have a bishop on g1 that's active and pinning something
- My knight on f6 has several good outposts
- I need to improve my king safety

One strong move would be to castle kingside with g8h8, which would connect my rooks and improve my king's safety.

4. My king is on e8 and can move to several squares

The most critical observation is that my bishop on g1 is delivering check to the white king. I should capitalize on this advantage.

Among my options, I see a strong move with my bishop on e3. I can attack White's king on c2 with a check by moving:

make_move e3c1

This delivers a check to White's king and forces a response. It's a strong tactical move that puts immediate pressure on my opponent and could lead to material gain or a better position depending on how White responds.

- I have two bishops (one on c1 and one on c8)
- My king is on e8 with a rook on each side (a8 and h8)
- I have a knight on f6
- White's king is on c2, quite exposed

Looking at my legal moves, I have several good options:

1. I could develop my dark-squared bishop from c1 with moves like c1g5 or c1f4
2. I could castle kingside with e8f8 (since I can't castle the traditional way with the rook on g8)
3. I could move my knight from f6 to better squares

The bishop on c1 is currently very active on the long diagonal, potentially targeting White's exposed king. I should prioritize this piece.

After analyzing the position, I see several good options. I notice that:

1. My king is on e8 with potential development options
2. I have a bishop on f4 that's actively placed and threatening white's position
3. My knight on f6 is well-positioned
4. I should consider improving my position and potentially addressing any threats

One strong move is to develop my rook with connectivity by playing:

make_move h8g8

This move connects my rooks, improves my king safety, and prepares for potential action on the g-file. It's a solid developing move that maintains my position while preparing for future plans.

I need to analyze the position carefully before making my move.

Looking at the board, I notice:
- I'm playing as Black with my king on e8
- White has a bishop on h7 threatening my rook on a8
- I have a knight on f6 and a bishop on f4 that are active
- White's king is on c3, somewhat exposed

Among my options, I see several strong candidates:

1. f4g3 - Moving my bishop to attack White's knight on f3
2. f6g4 - Developing my knight to a more active position
3. f6e4 - Knight to e4 could be strong, controlling central squares
4. e8f8 - King safety by moving away from the e-file

After evaluation, I believe the best move is to attack White's knight with my bishop.

- My king is on e8 with a rook on a8 and f8
- I have a knight on f6 and a bishop on g3
- White has a king on c3, a bishop on e4, and a knight on f5

Key considerations:
1. My bishop on g3 is attacking diagonally and could be valuable
2. My knight on f6 has several potential moves
3. I could consider castling kingside with f8g8

After evaluating the options, I believe developing my rook by castling kingside is a strong move that improves my king safety and connects my rooks.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Let me analyze the position:

I see I'm playing as Black and have several options. The position appears to be in the middlegame with some pieces already exchanged. I notice my bishop on g3 is attacking the white king on c3, though it's not check because the bishop's path is blocked by the white pawn on d4.

Looking at my legal moves, I have several strong options:

1. My bishop on g3 has several potential moves (g3h4, g3f4, g3h2, g3f2, g3e1)
2. My knight on f6 can move to several squares (h7, h5, d5, g4, e4)
3. I can move my king or rooks
4. I can advance my pawns

The most active piece appears to be my bishop on g3, which is well-positioned. My knight on f6 could potentially improve its position.

After evaluating the options, I think the knight move f6-d5 looks strong, as it centralizes my knight and puts pressure on the c3 square where the white king is located, as well as attacking the pawn on c7.

3. I have the option to develop my rook on a8 or g8

I'll choose to develop my kingside rook to f8, which helps connect my rooks and prepares for potential castling by hand (since the automatic castling right may be gone). This is a solid developing move that improves my position.

Looking at the position, castling kingside (f8g8) would be a strong move as it brings my king to safety and connects my rooks. This is particularly important since White's pieces seem to be somewhat active in the center.

After analyzing the position, I can see that:

1. I'm playing as Black and my king is on e8
2. White has a knight on g5 threatening my f7 pawn
3. I have a bishop on g3 that's actively placed
4. My rooks are on a8 and g8

Among my legal moves, I should prioritize addressing the knight threat on g5 or improving my position. The move f7-f6 would drive away the knight while maintaining pawn protection of my e5 pawn.

I'll analyze the position:

1. My king is on e8 with rooks on a8 and g8, so I still have castling options
2. I have a bishop on g3 that's actively placed and threatening the queenside
3. White has a knight on g4 and a bishop on d4
4. The pawn structure is somewhat broken on both sides

Looking at my options:

- Castling kingside with `e8f8` would improve my king safety
- Moving my bishop on g3 could maintain its activity or potentially capture something
- Advancing pawns like `e5e4` could gain space

After evaluating the position, I think castling kingside is my best move to improve king safety while connecting my rooks.

I'm playing as Black and have several options. Looking at the board:
- White has a bishop on e4, knight on g4, and rook on h1
- I have two bishops (c8 and g3), two rooks (a8 and f8), and my king on f8
- Material seems roughly equal, but I need to consider my king safety

Among my options:
- I could develop with moves like f6-f5
- I could improve my king's position with g8-g7
- My bishop on g3 has several good options (g3-h4, g3-f4, g3-h2, etc.)

The bishop on g3 is actively placed and threatening White's position. Moving it to h2 would attack White's king on b2, creating a check.

- White has a knight on g4 threatening my e5 pawn
- I have a bishop on h2 that's quite active
- My f6 pawn is under pressure from White's g4 knight

Key considerations:
1. The bishop on h2 is very active and could make a strong move
2. My e5 pawn is under attack from the knight
3. I should consider king safety

Among my options, moving the bishop on h2 to f4 looks particularly strong - it attacks White's d2 area while maintaining pressure. This is a developing move that improves my piece activity.

- I have bishops on c8 and f4, rooks on a8 and g8, and pawns on a7, b7, d7, e5, and f6
- My bishop on f4 has several good diagonal moves available

The most promising move appears to be my bishop on f4 capturing White's pawn on h2, which would be a free piece. This also creates a threat against White's king on b1.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Let me analyze the position and my available moves:

I see I'm playing as Black and the position is quite complex. Looking at the board:
- I have a bishop on h2 that can move to f4, g3, or g1
- My king is on g8 with moves to h8, g7, or g6
- I have a pawn on f6 that can move to g5 or f5
- I have a pawn on e5 that can push to e4
- I have pawns on a7 and b7 that can move to a6 and b6
- I have a rook on a8 that can move to b8

The most active move appears to be moving my bishop from h2 to f4, which would attack White's knight on g3 and potentially create threats. This bishop is currently very active on h2, controlling the long diagonal.

I'll make this move:

I'll analyze the position and my available moves:

The position shows I'm playing as Black with material roughly equal. I have a bishop on f4 that's quite active and can make several moves. I also have a rook on g8 that can move along the g-file or to h8.

Looking at my options:
- My bishop on f4 has several good moves, particularly f4g3 which attacks White's king
- Moving my e5 pawn to e4 could gain space
- I have some king safety moves with my rook (g8h8 or g8g7)

The most forcing and advantageous move appears to be moving my bishop to attack White's king:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

I'll analyze the position and my available moves:

The position shows I'm playing as Black with:
- My king on f8
- Rooks on a8 and g8
- Bishops on c8 and g3
- Pawns on a7, b7, d7, e5, and f6
- White has a knight on g4 threatening my f6 pawn

Key considerations:
1. My bishop on g3 is attacking White's position and is undefended
2. My f6 pawn is under attack from the knight on g4
3. I have control of the g-file with my rook

Among my legal moves, I see several strong options:
- g3h4: Attacking White's knight while moving my bishop to safety
- f6f5: Defending my pawn structure and challenging White's knight
- e5e4: Advancing my central pawn for more space

I think the best move is to attack White's knight while developing my position:

The position looks complex with material roughly equal. I'm playing as Black and need to make a strategic decision.

Key observations:
- I have a bishop on h4 that can move to several squares
- My king is on f8 with some potential moves
- I have a rook on a8 that can move to b8
- Various pawn moves are available

Looking at the most promising options:
1. h4g3 - Moving the bishop to attack White's position
2. f8e8 - King move to a safer square
3. h4g5 - Bishop move that could control more squares

I think improving my king's position is most urgent, as it seems somewhat exposed.

After analyzing the position, I see that I'm playing as Black with my king on e8. I notice my bishop on h4 is attacking the white king on d8 through the g3-c7 diagonal, but there's a white bishop on c2 blocking the check.

I have several good options:
1. I could move my rook on g8 to f8 to protect my king
2. I could move my bishop on h4 to threaten something
3. I could advance my f6 pawn

Looking at the position more carefully, I see that my bishop on h4 can capture on g3, which would be a strong move as it threatens the white pawn structure.

The bishop on g3 is particularly strong, putting pressure on the white position. I'll make a move with this bishop to maintain this pressure while potentially creating threats.

2. My king is on e8 and appears safe for now.
3. I notice my bishop on h2 has good mobility and can make some interesting moves.

Looking at my options, I see that my bishop on h2 can move to f4, which would put pressure on White's position and develop my piece to a more active square. This move would control important central squares and potentially create threats.

4. My pawn on e5 can advance to e4

Looking at the position, I notice my bishop on f4 is active and has several good options. I also see that advancing my e-pawn to e4 could gain space and put pressure on White's position.

After evaluating my options, I'll advance my e-pawn:

- Gains space in the center

I notice I have a material advantage with two bishops versus White's bishop and knight. My king is castled kingside, but my queenside is undeveloped. White's king is exposed in the center.

Looking at my options:
- I have a bishop on f4 with several good moves
- My e4 pawn can advance
- I can develop my queenside rook

The most active move seems to be using my bishop on f4. I can either attack White's kingside with Bf4-h6 or develop pressure on the center with Bf4-e5.

I'll choose to play the bishop to e5, which puts pressure on the center and controls important squares.

After analyzing the position, I see several key elements:

1. I'm playing as Black and have two bishops (c8 and e5), with the e5 bishop actively placed
2. My king is on e8 with potential castling options
3. I have a pawn on e4 that can advance

The e5 bishop is well-positioned, controlling several diagonals. My e4 pawn is advanced and can be pushed further. I also have castling options available.

Given these observations, I'll advance my e4 pawn to e3, which increases my control of the center and puts pressure on White's position.

One strong move would be to develop my rook from a8 to b8, which activates the rook and prepares for potential queenside play.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

I need to analyze the position carefully before making my move.

Looking at the board, I see I'm playing as Black with my king on e8. White has a king on f1, a bishop on h1, and a knight on d4. I have two bishops (c8 and g3), two rooks (b8 and g8), and several pawns.

The most pressing concern is my king's safety. I notice my bishop on g3 is well-positioned, controlling important diagonals. My rook on g8 could be better utilized.

Among my legal moves, I see a few strong candidates:
- Moving my king to f8 (e8f8) would improve king safety
- Moving my bishop g3 to e5 (g3e5) would centralize it and attack the knight on d4
- Moving my bishop g3 to h2 (g3h2) could create threats

After evaluation, I believe centralizing my bishop with g3e5 is strongest, putting pressure on White's knight and improving my piece activity.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Let me analyze the position:

I'm playing as Black and I see I have my king on e8 with rooks on b8 and g8, bishops on f8, and pawns on a7, d7, f6, and e3. White has bishops on c6 and c3, a knight on b3, and the king on f1.

Looking at my legal moves, I need to consider:
1. Safety of my king
2. Development of my pieces
3. Control of the center
4. Any tactical opportunities

The pawn on e3 is quite advanced and threatening to promote. I should consider pushing it to e2, which would be very strong.

I'll make this move as it creates a significant promotion threat that White must address immediately.

I'm playing as Black, and I notice several important features:
- White has two bishops (on c3 and c7) and a knight on b3
- My king is on e8 with my rooks on b8 and g8
- I have a pawn on e5 that could be developed

Looking at the legal moves, I need to consider both my king's safety and piece development. The most pressing issue is to ensure my king is safe.

I see that moving my king to d8 would be a solid choice, clearing the e-file and avoiding any potential threats from White's pieces. This also maintains flexibility for my rooks.

The most powerful move available is clearly the pawn promotion on e2. I'll promote to a queen as that's almost always the strongest choice.

I see several strong options:
1. I can check White's king with my queen (e1c3)
2. I can capture White's bishop with my queen (e1c3)
3. I can move my queen to threaten White's king from a different angle

The best move appears to be capturing the bishop on c3 while simultaneously checking the king:

I apologize for the error. Let me check the board again more carefully. It seems I misread the position. Let me look at the legal moves again and make a valid move.

Looking at the legal moves list, I see that c3c6 is not actually a legal move. Let me select a strong move from the available options.

The white bishop on c6 is a threat, but I can't capture it directly. Instead, I'll use my queen to attack the white knight on b3, which is undefended.

You are a professional chess player and you play as black. Now is your turn to make a move. Before making a move you can pick one of the following actions:
- 'get_current_board' to get the schema and current status of the board
- 'get_legal_moves' to get a UCI formatted list of available moves
- 'make_move <UCI formatted move>' when you are ready to complete your turn (e.g., 'make_move e2e4')

I need to analyze the position carefully before making my move.

Looking at the board:
- I'm playing as Black with my king on d8
- White has two bishops (c1 and f3) and a king on c2
- Material is roughly even, but I need to be careful about the bishops
- I have some pawn weaknesses and need to improve my position

Among my legal moves, I should prioritize:
1. King safety
2. Piece coordination
3. Addressing any immediate threats

The move h8g8 looks good as it connects my rooks, which is a fundamental principle in chess. This improves my piece coordination and prepares for potential counterplay on the g-file.

I need to analyze the position carefully before making my move.

Looking at the board:
- I'm playing as Black with my king on e8
- White has a king on c2 and two bishops (c8 and f3)
- I have rooks on b8 and g8, a bishop on f8, and pawns on a7, d7, and f6
- White has pawns on b4, c4, and a rook on h8

The position appears to be in the middlegame/endgame phase. My king's safety is important, and I should consider developing my pieces effectively.

Among my options:
- King moves like e8d8 would improve king safety
- Developing the bishop with f8g7 would activate that piece
- Rook moves like g8g2 could potentially create threats

After evaluation, I'll make a move that improves my position:

After analyzing the position, I see several good options. My knight on e4 is well-placed but could be targeted, and I need to continue development.

One of the strongest moves here is to develop my dark-squared bishop to e7, which helps protect my kingside and prepares for castling. This is a natural developing move that maintains a solid position.

You are a professional chess player and you play as black. Now is your turn to make a move. Before making a move you can pick one of the following actions:
- 'get_current_board' to get the schema and current status of the board
- 'get_legal_moves' to get a UCI formatted list of available moves
- 'make_move <UCI formatted move>' when you are ready to complete your turn (e.g., 'make_move e2e4')

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

I can see the position now. As Black, I have a knight on e4 that's quite active, and I notice that castling kingside (e8g8) is available, which is often a good priority in the opening/early middlegame to get the king to safety.

Looking at the position more carefully, I see that:
1. My king is still in the center
2. White has played f4, creating some tension with my knight on e4
3. I have a bishop on e7 that's developed
4. Castling kingside would be a solid move to improve my king safety

Given these considerations, I'll castle kingside:

After analyzing the position and my legal moves, I notice several key factors:

1. White's queen is on d4, creating pressure
2. My knight on e4 is well-positioned and can make several strong moves
3. I need to continue development and ensure king safety

The knight on e4 is particularly active and can make some tactical moves. One of the strongest options is to attack White's queen with Nc5, forcing it to move while developing my piece to a good square.

Looking at the options, I can see that moving the knight to e4 would be a strong move. This not only saves the knight but places it in a central position where it attacks White's queen and also controls important squares.

Looking at the position and legal moves, I need to address the threat to my e5 pawn. I have several good options:

1. I could defend the e5 pawn with moves like Nc6 (b8c6) or f6 (f7f6)
2. I could develop pieces with tempo by attacking the queen with Bd6 (e7d6)

The move Bd6 (e7d6) stands out as particularly strong since it develops a piece while attacking the queen, forcing it to move and relieving the pressure on my e5 pawn.

Thank you for providing the legal moves. Let me analyze the position and make a good move.

I notice White's queen is on a4, which is quite active but potentially exposed. My king is castled kingside, and I have several developing options.

Key considerations:
1. White's queen on a4 could be a target
2. I should continue development and improve my position
3. I need to ensure my king's safety

Among my options:
- Knight development with b8c6 would be solid
- Bishop moves like d6c5 could increase my control of the center
- Defensive moves like h7h6 might be useful to prevent back rank issues

After evaluation, I'll develop my knight to c6, which improves my position, helps control the center, and indirectly puts pressure on White's queen by threatening to play moves like Na5 later.

Thank you for providing the legal moves. Let me analyze the position and make a decision.

The most pressing issue is the white queen on a7, which is threatening my position. I need to address this threat while continuing my development.

Looking at my options:
- I could capture the queen with either Ra8xa7 or Nc6xa7
- I could defend against potential threats
- I could continue development

Taking the queen with Nc6xa7 seems like the best option as it removes the immediate threat and gains material. The knight is well-positioned to capture, and this would be a significant advantage.

Looking at my options, I notice I can recapture with e5xf4, which is listed as "e5e4" in the legal moves. This would maintain material equality. However, I should consider if there are better options.

I could develop my knight with Na7-c6, which would improve my piece activity. Another interesting option is to develop my dark-squared bishop with Bd6-c5, which would target White's kingside.

After consideration, I believe recapturing the pawn is the most straightforward and solid choice. This maintains material balance and doesn't allow White to gain a pawn advantage.

You are a professional chess player and you play as black. Now is your turn to make a move. Before making a move you can pick one of the following actions:
- 'get_current_board' to get the schema and current status of the board
- 'get_legal_moves' to get a UCI formatted list of available moves
- 'make_move <UCI formatted move>' when you are ready to complete your turn (e.g., 'make_move e2e4')

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

After analyzing the position, I see several good options. I notice that:

1. My king is on g8 and can move to h8
2. I have a pawn on e4 that could advance
3. My dark-squared bishop on d6 has many diagonal options
4. I have a knight on a7 that can develop

Looking at the position strategically, I should prioritize development and king safety. The pawn on f5 (White's pawn) is somewhat advanced, so I should consider how to respond to that.

One strong move would be to develop my knight from a7 to c6, which would control important central squares and prepare for potential queenside play.

The position shows White has advanced a pawn to f5, and I have a fairly standard development with knights and bishops out. I notice my king is still in the center, so castling would be a good priority.

I'll castle kingside to improve my king's safety:

- I could activate my queen with moves like d8e7 or d8f6
- I have knight development options with c6d4 or c6e5
- I could continue pawn development with moves like b7b6 or g7g6

Looking at the position more carefully, I see that developing my king to safety is important, and castling isn't directly available. Moving the king to e8 seems prudent to centralize it and prepare for potential kingside or queenside castling later.

Castling kingside would be a good strategic choice here as it:
- Brings my king to safety

Player_Black (to Proxy):

After analyzing the position, I see I'm playing as Black with a fairly developed position. White has advanced a pawn to f5, and I notice my knight on c6 and bishop on d6 have good activity.

Looking at the legal moves, I see several strong options. I should consider:

1. Castling kingside with either f8g8 or h8g8
2. Developing my rook with a8b8
3. Knight moves like c6d4 to attack the center
4. Pawn advances to create counterplay

Castling is a priority in the middlegame to secure king safety. Since both f8g8 (O-O) and h8g8 are listed as legal moves, this means I can castle kingside by moving either the king or rook (depending on the interface).

I'll castle kingside:

3. White has both bishops developed and knights on f3 and b1
4. My e-pawn has advanced to e4, putting pressure on f3

Looking at my options, I see a strong tactical opportunity. My e4 pawn can capture White's knight on f3, which would be a good material gain.

2. King safety: My king on g8 is reasonably safe
3. Piece activity: I have a knight on e5 that's well-positioned

The knight on e5 is particularly strong, controlling several squares in White's territory. I should consider my best options:

- The knight on e5 has several good moves, particularly Nf3+ which would give check
- I could develop my rooks or improve my queen's position

The move Nf3+ (e5f3) looks particularly strong as it gives check and attacks White's position.

Looking at the position strategically, I'll play:

make_move f3d4

This knight move to d4 is strong because:
1. It attacks the center of the board
2. It puts pressure on White's position
3. The knight is well-placed on d4 where it can't be easily attacked
4. It threatens White's pawn structure
5. It maintains my piece activity while improving my position

Player_Black (to Proxy):

I'll analyze this position carefully before making my move.

Looking at the board, I notice:
- White has advanced a pawn to f5
- White's king is on d3, somewhat exposed
- My king is on g8 with the rook still on h8
- I have both bishops developed (d6 and c8)
- My queen is on d8

Among my legal moves, I see several strong options:

1. The bishop on d6 has multiple attacking possibilities, including g3 which could threaten White's position
2. I could develop my queen to create threats
3. I could castle by moving my king to f8 or e8

After evaluating the position, I believe the best move is to develop my dark-squared bishop with a threat.

I can see the current position and my legal moves. Let me analyze the situation:

1. I'm playing as Black and have two bishops (one on g3), a queen, two rooks, and all my pawns
2. White has a king on c2, two bishops, a knight, two rooks, and several pawns
3. My bishop on g3 is attacking White's position and has several good options

After evaluating the position, I see that my bishop on g3 has a strong diagonal and can potentially win material. The move g3e1 looks particularly strong as it appears to capture a piece or deliver a strong check.

2. My king is on g8 with the rook on h8
3. I have a bishop on c8 and queen on d8
4. The pawn structure is mostly intact

Looking at my options, I notice my bishop on e1 is already well-positioned, attacking the white position. I should consider developing more pieces or improving my king's safety.

One strong move would be to connect my rooks by moving the king to f8, which also steps out of any potential discovered attacks.

I need to analyze this position carefully. 

I notice that:
- White has a rook on g7 that's attacking my position
- I have a bishop on e1 that's deep in White's territory
- My king is on g8 with potential safety concerns

Looking at the legal moves, I see I can castle with Kg8-h8 or move the king to g8. I also have the option to move my bishop on e1.

The most pressing issue is my king's safety with White's rook on g7. I should prioritize defending against potential threats.

One strong move would be to move my bishop from e1 to capture on g3, which would attack White's position while developing my piece.

2. White has a rook on g7 that's infiltrated my position
3. My king is on g8 with a rook on f8 nearby

One of my strongest moves is to use my bishop on g3 to attack White's position. The bishop on g3 has several good options, including Bh4, Bf4, or Bd6.

I'll choose to play Bd6 with the bishop from g3, which develops the piece to a strong central square, controls important central squares, and prepares to connect my rooks later.

The most pressing issue is the rook on g7, which is attacking my position. I have a few defensive options, but the most direct is to capture it with my pawn.

I notice that my king is on g8, and I have a rook on f8 that can move. I also have a bishop on d6 with several potential moves, and my queen on d8 has mobility.

Looking at the position strategically, I see that:
1. My bishop on d6 has some strong diagonal options
2. I could consider castling queenside with h8g8
3. My queen can develop to e7 or f6

The bishop on d6 is particularly active and could create threats by moving to g3, targeting White's kingside. This looks like a strong attacking move that puts pressure on White's position.

The bishop on g3 is particularly strong and can make several good moves. I think the most impactful move is to increase the pressure with this bishop by moving it to e5, where it controls more of the center and attacks the white position.

You are a professional chess player and you play as black. Now is your turn to make a move. Before making a move you can pick one of the following actions:
- 'get_current_board' to get the schema and current status of the board
- 'get_legal_moves' to get a UCI formatted list of available moves
- 'make_move <UCI formatted move>' when you are ready to complete your turn (e.g., 'make_move e2e4')

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

I can now see all my legal moves. Let me analyze the position:

1. I notice my king is on g8 with a rook on f8, so castling is not an option anymore.
2. I have a bishop on e5 that's actively placed and could potentially capture the white bishop on g3 or attack h2.
3. White has a bishop on g3 that's targeting my queenside.
4. My queen is on d8 and could develop.

After evaluating the position, I see that my bishop on e5 is well-placed and can make a strong move by capturing the white bishop on h2, putting pressure on White's kingside.

After analyzing the position and my available moves, I see several options. I notice my king is on h8 and there's a potential threat from White's bishop on g7. I also have a bishop on h2 that has several good options.

Looking at the position strategically, I think one of my strongest moves is to develop my bishop from h2 to f4, which would control important central squares and put pressure on White's position.

I need to analyze the position carefully before making my move.

Looking at the board, I notice:
- White has a bishop on g7 threatening my kingside
- My king is on g8 with a rook on f8 nearby
- I have a bishop on f4 that's quite active
- The pawn structure shows I'm missing my f-pawn

One of my strongest moves appears to be with my bishop on f4, which has several good options. The h2 square looks particularly attractive as it would attack White's rook on a2 along the a2-g8 diagonal.

I'll make this move:

Thank you for providing the legal moves. Let me analyze the position:

2. White has a bishop on g7 threatening my kingside
3. My king is on g8 with rooks on b8 and f8
4. I have a material advantage with a queen and two bishops

Looking at my options, the bishop on h2 has several strong moves. I can either continue the attack with this bishop or address the threat from White's bishop on g7.

One of the strongest moves appears to be capturing White's bishop on f1 with my bishop:

After analyzing the position, I see several options as Black. 

I notice that White has a bishop on h5 and a knight on c3, with their king on b2. My king is on g8, and I have a bishop on g1 that's attacking diagonally. I also see I have a rook on f8 that could be developed.

One strong move would be to develop my dark-squared bishop with:

make_move g1f2

This move puts pressure on White's position, attacking the king on b2 and creating a powerful diagonal threat. This check forces White to respond to the immediate threat and gives me the initiative.

- I have material advantage with both rooks, queen, and bishops still on the board
- My king is on g8 with potential castling options

One of the strongest moves I see is to use my bishop on f2 to attack White's exposed position. The bishop on f2 can move to either e1 or g1, putting pressure on White's back rank.

I'll make the move:

Let me analyze the position:

I'm playing as Black and I notice several things:
- White has a king on a3 that seems exposed
- I have a bishop on e1 that's attacking diagonally
- I have my queen and rooks still available
- There appears to be a potential tactical opportunity with my bishop on e1

Looking at the legal moves, I see I have a bishop on e1 that can move to several squares. Since this bishop is aimed at White's position and could potentially create threats, I'll examine this option.

The move e1f2 looks particularly strong as it puts the bishop on a diagonal that attacks White's king area. This creates a direct threat and puts pressure on White.

After analyzing the position and my legal moves, I notice I have a bishop on f2 that's attacking White's position. This bishop is very active and I should consider using it effectively.

Looking at the moves for my bishop on f2, I can see several strong options:
- f2d4 would attack White's knight on c3
- f2e3 would control important central squares
- f2g1 could potentially win material

The move f2g1 looks particularly strong as it appears to attack White's rook on c2 with a discovered attack from my bishop. This could win material.

After analyzing the position, I can see I'm playing as Black and have several options. 

I notice White has a bishop on c7 that's attacking my queen on d8. I should address this threat. I also see my bishop on g1 has some good diagonal moves available.

Looking at the legal moves, I have options like moving my queen to safety (d8e8, d8e7, etc.), developing my rook (f8e8), or making a bishop move with g1.

The most pressing issue is my queen being under attack, so I'll move it to e8, which both saves the queen and connects my rooks.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

I need to analyze the position carefully before making my move.

Looking at the board, I notice:
- I'm playing as Black with my king on g8
- White's king is on a3, quite exposed
- I have a bishop on g1 that's attacking along the a7-g1 diagonal
- White has a knight on c3 and bishops on g3 and f1
- Material seems roughly equal

Among my legal moves, I see some interesting options:
- I could move my queen (e8) to various squares
- I have bishop moves with g1
- I could castle kingside with either rook (f8g8 or h8g8)

The bishop on g1 is well-positioned, attacking the a7-g1 diagonal. Moving my queen to e3 would create a powerful attack, threatening White's exposed king.

I'll make this move:

Player_Black (to Proxy):

I can see that I'm playing as Black and my king is in the h8 position. I only have two legal moves available: h8g8 and h8g7.

Looking at the board position:
- I'm playing as Black with my king on h8
- I have very limited mobility with only two king moves available
- White has a strong attack with pieces aimed at my king's position
- My queen is active on f2, but my king's safety is the priority

Since I only have two options, I need to choose the safer square for my king. Moving to g8 keeps my king on the back rank where it might be more vulnerable to checks. Moving to g7 brings my king slightly away from the corner and might offer better defensive prospects.

4. I have rooks on b8 and f8, and a bishop on g1

One of the strongest moves available is to use my queen to attack White's king on a3. This creates an immediate threat while also potentially setting up tactical opportunities.

You are a professional chess player and you play as black. Now is your turn to make a move. Before making a move you can pick one of the following actions:
- 'get_current_board' to get the schema and current status of the board
- 'get_legal_moves' to get a UCI formatted list of available moves
- 'make_move <UCI formatted move>' when you are ready to complete your turn (e.g., 'make_move e2e4')

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

I need to analyze this position carefully before making my move.

Looking at the board, I see that:
- I'm playing as Black with my king on g7
- White has a king on a3
- I have a queen on a6, rook on f8, bishops on g1 and b8, and several pawns
- White has two bishops (c4 and d4), a rook on c2, a knight on d2, and some pawns

My queen on a6 is well positioned, attacking along the a-file. The bishop on g1 is also active. I notice my rook on f8 has many possible moves.

Given the position, I should prioritize:
1. Safety of my king
2. Increasing the activity of my pieces
3. Creating threats against White's king

One strong move would be to bring my rook to the a-file where it can coordinate with my queen to attack along White's back rank.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

I apologize for the error. Let me check the legal moves again and make a valid move.

Looking at the legal moves list, I see that "f8a8" isn't actually legal, which means there must be a piece in between. Let me choose another strong move from the available options.

The move "a6a8" looks strong - it places my queen on the back rank where it can potentially create threats against White's king.

I need to analyze this position carefully before making my move.

Looking at the board:
- I'm playing as Black with my king on g7
- White has a king on b2 with a rook on c2 and a knight on d2
- I have two rooks (a8, f8), a queen on a8, and a bishop on g1
- There's a material advantage for me, but I need to be careful about my king's safety

Among my options:
- I could develop my bishop on g1 to a more active square like e3 or d4
- I could improve my rook position with f8-f2 to attack White's position
- I could advance my h-pawn with h7-h5 to gain space

The most active and threatening move appears to be moving my bishop to d4, which puts pressure on White's position and controls important central squares.

4. I have a queen on a8 that can move along the a-file

Looking at the position, I see my bishop on d4 is well-placed and threatening the white king area. I can increase the pressure by moving it to f2, which attacks the white king on b2 and the pawn on c3.

Looking at the board:
- I have a material advantage with queen, two rooks, two bishops vs. White's rook, knight, and two bishops
- My king on g7 seems relatively safe
- I have a bishop on f4 that's actively placed and threatening White's position

Among my options:
1. I could develop my rook with f8e8 or f8d8
2. I could move my bishop on f4 to a more aggressive position
3. I could improve my king's safety

The bishop on f4 is particularly strong, controlling important diagonals. Moving it to g3 would put pressure on White's position and restrict their king's movement.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

After analyzing the position, I see several key elements:

1. I'm playing as Black and have a material advantage (queen, two rooks, two bishops vs. white's rook, knight, and two bishops)
2. My king on g7 is relatively safe
3. White has a bishop on d4 that's attacking my pawn on b7
4. I have a bishop on g3 that's active and could potentially create threats

Looking at my options, I notice I can attack White's king with my rook. This seems like the strongest move as it puts immediate pressure on White.

After analyzing the position, I see several promising options:

1. The rook on f2 has multiple strong moves, particularly targeting White's position
2. My bishop on g3 can move to create threats
3. I have a queen on a8 that could be activated

Among these options, I think the most powerful move is to use my rook on f2 to attack White's king position:

I notice several key aspects of the position:
- I have a queen on a8, king on g7, and two bishops (g3 and e2)
- There's a rook on e2 that's currently attacking along the e-file
- White has a king on c3 and some pieces including bishops on c1 and g5

One of my strongest pieces is the rook on e2, which is currently active. I should consider using it to create threats or gain material.

The move e2e1 looks particularly strong as it attacks White's back rank, potentially setting up checkmate threats or winning material.

1. I'm playing as Black and have a queen on a8, king on g7, bishops on g3 and c8, a rook on b1, and several pawns.
2. White has a king on a5, bishops on c8 and g5, a rook on c2, a knight on d2, and some pawns.
3. Material seems roughly equal, but position evaluation is important.

Looking at my options:
- My bishop on g3 is attacking White's position and has several good moves
- My rook on b1 controls the b-file
- My king on g7 seems relatively safe

I think the most powerful move is to use my bishop on g3 to attack. The diagonal to e1 looks particularly strong.

I need to make a strong move here. Looking at my options:

1. My bishop on e1 has several good diagonal moves
2. I could advance pawns to create space or threats
3. I could improve my queen's position

The bishop on e1 is particularly active and could create threats. Moving it to h4 would pin White's g-pawn against their king, which seems strong.

I notice my bishop on h4 has several good options, including a potential check with Bh4-d8+. However, I should first check if there are any immediate threats or tactical opportunities.

The bishop on h4 is quite active and can potentially deliver a check. Moving it to d8 would put White's king in check and force a response.

I'll analyze the position as Black:

The position is quite complex with material roughly even. I have two bishops, a queen, and a king with pawns, while White has two bishops, a knight, a rook, and a king with pawns.

My king on g7 seems relatively safe for now. I notice White has two bishops on g4 and g5, which are creating some pressure. My queen on d8 has many possible moves.

Looking at the legal moves, I should prioritize development and king safety. The move d8e7 (moving my queen to e7) looks strong as it:
1. Develops the queen to a more active square
2. Protects the king indirectly
3. Maintains flexibility for future plans
4. Doesn't lose material

I notice White has some attacking pieces including bishops on g4 and g5, and a rook on g2. My king's position seems somewhat exposed, so safety is a priority.

Among my options:
- I could develop my queen with a8b8
- I could improve my king's safety with g7h8 or g7f8
- I could move my bishop with e7f6 or other squares

After evaluating the position, I'll move my king to a safer square:

I'm playing as Black, and I notice several important features of the position:
- I have my king on f8 with potential to castle kingside (f8g8)
- My queen is on a8
- I have bishops on c8 and e7
- White has a rook on h1 and the white king is on a3
- White has bishops on g4 and g5

Looking at my options, castling kingside with Kg8 (f8g8) seems like a good choice as it would improve my king safety. The h-file is currently not under attack from White's rook.

- I'm playing as Black with my king on g8
- White has a king on a5, knights on b1, bishops on g5 and g6, and a rook on f2
- Material is roughly even, but I need to be careful about potential threats

Key considerations:
- My king's safety is a priority
- I should look for opportunities to improve my piece positioning
- Need to watch for any tactical threats from White

After analyzing the position, I see that my dark-squared bishop on e7 has good mobility and could be developed to a more active square. Moving it to g5 would put pressure on the center and potentially create threats.

The White pieces include:
- King on a3
- Knight on b1
- Two bishops on g3 and g4
- Rook on f2
- Pawns on a6, b4, c4

Looking at the position, I notice my bishop on g5 is very active and has multiple good options. The bishop on g5 is attacking White's bishop on d2 (which appears to be on c1 in the legal moves list). Taking this bishop would be valuable.

I also need to be mindful of my king's safety and potential threats from White's pieces.

After evaluating the options, I'll capture White's bishop with my bishop:

Looking at the legal moves, I need to consider safety and potential threats. The bishop on c1 is particularly active and could be used for a strong move.

I notice my bishop on c1 can move to several squares. Moving it to h6 would create a strong diagonal control and put pressure on White's position.

Looking at the position, I notice my dark-squared bishop on h6 has good mobility and could potentially create threats. My queen on a8 is somewhat passive. I should consider improving my piece positions and potentially creating threats against White's king on b2.

The move h6f4 looks particularly strong as it:
1. Attacks White's pawn on c1 with the bishop
2. Creates a potential fork threat against White's king and other pieces
3. Improves my bishop's activity from the edge of the board

I'll make this move:

I need to analyze the position carefully before making my move.

Looking at the board, I see that:
- I'm playing as Black with my king on g8
- White has a king on a4, two bishops (e5, g5), a knight on b1, a rook on f5
- I have a queen on a8, two bishops (c8, f4), and several pawns
- Material is roughly even

My bishop on f4 is quite active and has many potential moves. I notice it's currently attacking White's e5 bishop. Taking that bishop would be a material gain.

I'll capture the white bishop on e5:

Thank you for providing the legal moves. Let me analyze the position and make a strong move.

I notice several important features of the position:
- I have a bishop on e5 with many potential moves
- White has a rook on f6 and bishops on g6 and e6
- My king is on g8 and could potentially be in danger

Looking at my options, I see that my bishop on e5 can capture White's rook on f6 with e5f6. This would eliminate an important attacking piece and gain material (a rook is worth more than a bishop).

4. I have two bishops (c8 and f6) and my queen on a8

Looking at my options, I notice my dark-squared bishop on f6 has excellent mobility and could create threats. The move f6h4 looks particularly strong as it:
- Attacks White's king position
- Creates a pin or discovery threat potential
- Improves my bishop's activity

- White has a king on a4, knights on b4, bishops on g3 and f1, a rook on f2, and pawns on a3, b5, and c5

Key observations:
- My bishop on h4 is attacking along the h4-d8 diagonal and could potentially deliver a check
- My queen on a8 has mobility but isn't currently in an active position
- My king safety is important to consider

After evaluating the options, I'll make a move with my bishop on h4 to e7, which improves its position and maintains control of important central squares.

2. White has a king on a4, knights on b5, bishops on e5 and f1, rook on f2, and pawns on a3, b4, and c4.

Looking at the position, I notice:
- My bishop on e7 has several good options, including a potential check on b4
- My queen on a8 could be developed
- I should be careful about White's bishop on e5 which is attacking diagonally

After evaluating the options, I'll move my bishop to b4, putting White's king in check:

I need to analyze this position carefully as Black.

Looking at the board:
- I have my king on g8, queen on a8, and two bishops (one on b4)
- White has a knight on b5 threatening my bishop on b4
- White has a rook on f6 and bishops on g7 and f1
- White's king is on a4

Key considerations:
1. My bishop on b4 is under attack by the knight on b5
2. I should evaluate if there are any tactical opportunities
3. I need to ensure my king's safety

After analyzing the position, I see that my bishop on b4 is under attack, but it's also pinning White's king on a4. This is a powerful pin that I should maintain. Moving the bishop would release the pin and allow the white king to escape.

I'll make a move that improves my position while maintaining pressure:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Let me analyze the position and my available moves:

I see I'm playing as Black with:
- A queen on a8
- A king on g7
- Bishops on b4 and h8
- Pawns on b7, d7, g6, and h7

White has:
- A king on a4
- A knight on b3
- A rook on f6
- A bishop on f1
- Pawns on a3, c4, and f6

Key observations:
1. My bishop on b4 is attacking White's king on a4 - this is check!
2. White's rook on f6 is threatening my king on g7

Since I'm in a position to deliver checkmate, I should examine if any of my moves can win immediately. The bishop on b4 is already giving check, and if White can't escape, I might have a checkmate opportunity.

Looking at the king's escape squares:
- a5 is controlled by my bishop
- b5 is controlled by my bishop
- b4 is occupied by my bishop

I need to see if I can deliver checkmate. My queen on a8 could potentially help. Moving it to a6 would control b5 while the bishop controls a5.

After analyzing the position, I see that I'm playing as Black and have several strong pieces including a queen on a6, two bishops (on c8 and b4), and my king on g6. White has a rook on f6 that's currently attacking my g-pawn, a knight on b4, and the white king is on b3.

I notice several promising options:
1. I could attack the white king with my queen (a6b5)
2. I could capture the rook with my queen (a6f6)
3. I could move my bishop to attack the white king (b4c3)

The strongest move appears to be attacking the white king with my bishop, which creates a check and potentially leads to a winning position.

You are a professional chess player and you play as black. Now is your turn to make a move. Before making a move you can pick one of the following actions:
- 'get_current_board' to get the schema and current status of the board
- 'get_legal_moves' to get a UCI formatted list of available moves
- 'make_move <UCI formatted move>' when you are ready to complete your turn (e.g., 'make_move e2e4')

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

After analyzing the position and legal moves, I see I'm playing as Black with several key pieces: a queen on a6, two bishops (on c8 and e5), and my king on g7. White has a knight on b5, a rook on d4, a bishop on f1, and the white king on b2.

I notice my bishop on e5 is attacking White's rook on d4, which is a valuable piece. Taking this rook would be a significant material gain. Additionally, this move is safe as the rook doesn't appear to be protected.

I'll capture the rook with my bishop:

After analyzing the position, I see several key factors:

1. I'm playing as Black and have two bishops (c8 and d4), a queen (a6), and my king (g7)
2. White has a king (b3), a bishop (d3), a knight (b4), and some pawns
3. My queen on a6 is very active and can potentially create threats

Looking at my options, I notice my bishop on d4 has a powerful diagonal and can create a strong threat:

make_move d4f2

This move attacks White's undefended pawn on c5 while simultaneously creating a discovered attack from my queen on a6 toward White's king on b3. If White captures my bishop with a piece, my queen can potentially deliver check. This creates tactical pressure and forces White to respond carefully.

I notice my queen on a6 has many potential moves, and my bishop on f2 is also quite active. My king on g7 appears relatively safe, though I should be mindful of the white knight on b5 and bishop on d3.

One of the strongest moves appears to be moving my bishop from f2 to capture on a7, which would attack the b-pawn. This creates a direct threat while improving my bishop's position.

After analyzing the position and available moves, I can see I'm playing as Black with a material advantage (two bishops, a queen, and several pawns against White's king and bishop). 

I notice my queen on b5 has many potential moves. One strong option is to attack White's king directly with:

make_move b5a4

This move puts pressure on White's king at a1, creating a powerful threat. The queen controls the a4-e8 diagonal and restricts the White king's movement. This sets up potential checkmate threats while maintaining control of the position.

I need to analyze this position carefully. 

I'm playing as Black and I see that:
- I have two bishops (a7 and c8)
- My king is on g6
- I have pawns on b7, d7, g7, and h7
- White has a king on a2 and a bishop on a4
- White has a pawn on c3

Looking at the legal moves, I need to consider my best option. The position appears to be in the endgame phase with few pieces left.

My bishop on a7 has good mobility along the a7-g1 diagonal. The bishop on c8 is somewhat restricted. My king on g6 seems relatively safe.

One strong move would be to advance my bishop to e3, which would control important squares and put pressure on White's position.

Thank you for providing the legal moves. Let me analyze the position and make a good move.

I notice I have several strong options with my bishop on e5 (which appears as e3 in the move list). This bishop is very active and can potentially capture White's bishop on b4.

Looking at the moves, I see that I can play e3b6, which would attack White's bishop on b4. This would force White to either move the bishop or defend it. Since I don't see an immediate way for White to defend the bishop, this looks like a strong move that would likely win material.

You are a professional chess player and you play as black. Now is your turn to make a move. Before making a move you can pick one of the following actions:
- 'get_current_board' to get the schema and current status of the board
- 'get_legal_moves' to get a UCI formatted list of available moves
- 'make_move <UCI formatted move>' when you are ready to complete your turn (e.g., 'make_move e2e4')

Player_Black (to Proxy):

After analyzing the position, I see that I'm playing as Black with my king on g7. White has a king on b3 and a bishop on b4. I have two bishops (on b6 and c8), and pawns on b7, d7, g6, and h7.

Looking at my legal moves, I notice a few key options:
- I can move my bishop on b6 in several directions
- I can advance my pawns
- I can move my king

The most active move appears to be using my bishop on b6, which has a long diagonal. I'll play:

make_move b6e3

This move places my bishop on a strong diagonal, controlling important central squares and putting pressure on White's position. It maintains good piece activity while keeping my king safe.

I notice my bishop on e3 is very active and can potentially deliver a strong check. The move e3f2 would check the white king, forcing it to move. This is a strong tactical opportunity.

Looking at my options, I notice my bishop on b6 has several strong diagonal moves. In particular, I can attack White's king with:

make_move b6f2

This puts my bishop on f2, delivering a check to White's king on b2. This is a strong move that forces White to respond to the check, giving me the initiative.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Thank you for providing the legal moves. Now I can analyze the position and make a decision.

Looking at the position, I notice several key factors:
- I have two bishops (c8 and f2) and my opponent has one bishop (a4)
- My bishop on f2 is very active and has multiple good options
- White's king is exposed on b4 with my bishop on f2 potentially creating threats

The most promising move appears to be using my active bishop on f2. Among the options, capturing the white pawn on c5 with the bishop looks strong as it:
1. Wins material (a free pawn)
2. Maintains the bishop's activity
3. Clears the c-file which could be useful later

I'll make this move:

make_move f2c5

- Bishops on c8 and f2
- Pawns on b7, d7, g6, and h7
- White has a king on c3, a bishop on b4, and pawns on c3 and d7

Looking at my options, I notice my bishop on f2 is very active and has several strong moves. It's currently attacking along the a7-g1 diagonal and can potentially create threats.

The best move appears to be to use my bishop to create a strong threat:

make_move f2a7

This move:
1. Places my bishop on a7, which is a safe square
2. Maintains control of important diagonals
3. Creates potential threats against White's position
4. Keeps my bishop active rather than retreating it

You are a professional chess player and you play as black. Now is your turn to make a move. Before making a move you can pick one of the following actions:
- 'get_current_board' to get the schema and current status of the board
- 'get_legal_moves' to get a UCI formatted list of available moves
- 'make_move <UCI formatted move>' when you are ready to complete your turn (e.g., 'make_move e2e4')

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

I need to analyze this position carefully before making my move.

Looking at the board:
- I'm playing as Black with my king on g6
- White's king is on c3
- Material is roughly even with bishops for both sides
- I have a passed pawn on h7 that could be valuable

Key considerations:
1. King safety is important - my king seems relatively safe but should stay active
2. My bishop on a7 has a long diagonal and good mobility
3. The bishop on c8 is somewhat restricted
4. I should consider advancing my pawns when beneficial

Among my options, I see a few strong candidates:
- Moving my bishop a7 to control more squares
- Advancing my d7 pawn to d5 to gain space
- Moving my king to improve its position

After evaluation, I believe advancing my d-pawn gives me the best control of the center while maintaining my position.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

After analyzing the position, I can see I'm playing as Black with two bishops, a king, and several pawns. White has a bishop and king.

I notice my king is on g7, and I have bishops on c8 and a7. My most active piece is the bishop on a7, which has a long diagonal. I also see that my d5 pawn is under attack by White's bishop on b3.

Looking at my options, I should either:
1. Defend the d5 pawn
2. Make a strong move with one of my bishops
3. Improve my king position

The bishop on a7 has excellent mobility, and I can use it to create threats or defend the d5 pawn.

I'll move my bishop from a7 to d4, which defends my pawn on d5 and places the bishop on a strong central square where it controls important diagonals.

White has a king on d3, a bishop on c4, and pawns on c3 and h2.

Looking at my options, I notice my bishop on d4 has many strong moves. In particular, I can attack White's king with a check by moving the bishop to e3.

This check would force White to respond, giving me initiative. It's a strong tactical opportunity that I shouldn't miss.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

After analyzing the position, I see I'm playing as Black with two bishops, a king, and three pawns against White's king, bishop, and pawn. 

I notice my bishop on e3 is attacking the white king on d3, giving check. This is a critical moment where I should capitalize on this advantage.

Looking at my legal moves, I see that I can move my bishop on e3 to several squares while maintaining the check. The most powerful option appears to be:

make_move e3f4

This maintains the check while controlling important squares. If White moves the king, I'll still have strong pressure and can potentially win material in the following moves.

After analyzing the position and my legal moves, I need to make a strategic decision.

I apologize for the confusion. It seems there was a discrepancy between the board display and the actual position. Let me check the legal moves again and make a correct move.

Looking at the legal moves list, I see that my bishop is actually on f4 (not f5 as I initially thought), and one of my options is to capture the white bishop on c4 with "f4c4".

However, this move was rejected as illegal. Let me try the correct UCI format for this capture.

3. Potential threats or opportunities

The bishop on c7 has good mobility and could be developed to increase pressure. Moving it to e5 would put it on a strong diagonal and attack White's position.

Key observations:
- My bishop on e5 is very active and controls important diagonals
- I should look for tactical opportunities or ways to improve my position

After evaluating the options, I see that my bishop on e5 has several strong moves. In particular, moving it to f4 creates a powerful diagonal threat toward White's king area.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

After analyzing the position, I see that I'm playing as Black with my king on g7, pawns on h7 and d5, and two bishops on c8 and f4. White has a king on d3 and two bishops on b3 and c1.

Looking at my legal moves, I notice several strong options:

1. My bishop on f4 is active and has many potential moves
2. My king on g7 needs to stay safe
3. I have a pawn on d5 that could advance

The most promising move appears to be f4e3, moving my bishop to attack the e3 square which controls important central squares and puts pressure on White's position. This move maintains my bishop's activity while potentially creating threats.

Looking at the available moves, I'll play one of the standard responses to White's Nf3. The most principled response is to develop my knight to f6, which controls the center, prepares for castling, and is in line with classical opening principles.

Now let's check what legal moves I have available.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Now I have a clear picture of the position and my available moves.

Looking at the position, I should focus on controlling the center and developing my pieces. The most principled move here is to challenge White's central pawn with either e5 or d5. Since White has played d4, playing e5 would create a direct confrontation in the center.

I'll play e7-e5, which:
1. Challenges White's central pawn
2. Opens lines for my bishop and queen
3. Claims central space
4. Follows classical opening principles

One of the strongest moves here is to develop my dark-squared bishop while attacking White's queen. This would improve my development and create immediate pressure.

2. My knight on e4 is active and threatening several squares
3. I have a bishop on e7 that could be developed

Castling is a priority in the middlegame to ensure king safety, and I see that the kingside is clear for me to castle. This will connect my rooks and bring my king to safety.

- 'get_legal_moves' to get a UCI formatted list of available moves
- 'make_move <UCI formatted move>' when you are ready to complete your turn (e.g., 'make_move e2e4')

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Let me analyze the position:

I'm playing as Black and have several interesting options. I notice my knights are well-positioned, especially the knight on e4 which is centralized and attacking White's bishop on f2. I also have a bishop pair.

Looking at the position strategically, I see that:
1. My knight on e4 is strong and could capture the bishop on f2 with a fork
2. The e5 pawn is advanced but could be vulnerable
3. I haven't castled yet, which could be a priority for king safety

The most promising move appears to be capturing White's bishop with my knight, which would also fork the rook on h1:

I can see the current position and my legal moves. Let me analyze the situation:

1. I'm playing as Black and have a knight on f2 that's attacking White's position
2. My king is on g8 with a rook on f8
3. I have a bishop on e7 that could be developed
4. My knight on c6 is already developed

The knight on f2 is very active and putting pressure on White's position. It's attacking the rook on h1 and also threatening d1 and d3. This is a strong outpost for my knight.

I think one of my best moves is to continue development while maintaining my knight's strong position. Moving my bishop from e7 to g5 would develop it to an active square, putting pressure on the center.

I notice I'm playing Black and the position is somewhat complex. White has developed pieces and my king is on g8. I have a knight on f2 that's quite active and threatening White's position. I also have a bishop on g5 that's developed well.

Looking at the available moves, I should prioritize development, king safety, and taking advantage of my active pieces.

The knight on f2 is particularly strong and could be used to create threats. Moving it to e4 would attack White's queen and maintain a strong central position.

I'll play the knight move from e4 to f2, which is a fork attacking White's king on e3 and rook on h1 simultaneously. This is a very strong tactical shot.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Thank you for providing the legal moves. Now I can analyze the position and make a decision.

Looking at the position, I notice several important factors:
1. My knight on h1 is in an unusual position and can move to g3 or f2
2. My bishop on g4 is attacking White's queen on d1
3. I have a bishop on g5 with several possible moves

One of the strongest moves appears to be capturing White's queen with my bishop. If the bishop on g4 can capture the queen on d1, that would be a winning move. However, I don't see "g4d1" in the legal moves list, which suggests either the queen is protected or there's a piece in between.

Looking at other tactical opportunities, my knight on h1 can move to f2, which would be a fork attacking White's king on d2 and possibly another piece.

After careful consideration, I'll play the knight fork:

The position appears to be in the middle game with some pieces already exchanged. I notice my knight on f2 is well-positioned and attacking White's king on d1. I also have a bishop on g5 that's active.

I think one of the strongest moves here is to increase the pressure with my knight on f2, moving it to d3 where it attacks White's queen and maintains pressure on the king area.

Let me analyze the position and make a strategic decision.

I notice several key aspects of the position:
- I have two knights (c6 and d3) that are actively placed
- My bishop on g5 is attacking the f4 square
- White has a knight on g4 that could be threatening
- My pawn structure is generally intact

Looking at the available moves, I see a strong tactical opportunity with my knight on d3. It can fork White's king on d4 and potentially another piece.

Looking at the position more carefully, I see that my knight on f4 is attacking White's pawn on g2, which appears to be undefended. Capturing this pawn would win material.

Thank you for providing the legal moves. Let me analyze the position and make a decision.

I notice several important features of the position:
- I have two knights (on c6 and g2) and two bishops (on c8 and g5)
- My king is on g8 with the rook on f8 (I haven't castled yet)
- White has knights on c4 and g4, and the white king is on d3

Looking at my options, I see some tactical opportunities. The knight on g2 is particularly interesting as it's deep in White's territory and could potentially fork pieces.

I'll play the knight move g2e3, which attacks White's queen on e1 and also threatens a fork of the king and rook if not addressed.

The position shows I have two knights (on c6 and e3), two bishops (on g5 and c8), and my king is on g8. I notice my knight on e3 is quite active in White's territory and can make several strong moves.

One particularly strong move is to capture White's pawn on d1 with my knight, which would promote it to a queen: e3d1. This would give me a significant material advantage.

I notice I'm playing Black and have several interesting options. My knight on d1 is attacking White's queen on b2, which is a significant tactical opportunity. I also have a bishop on g5 that's active.

The most immediate priority is to capitalize on the knight fork I have with my knight on d1, which is attacking both White's queen on b2 and potentially another piece on f2 (though I can't see what's on f2 from the board representation).

I'll capture the queen with my knight:

The most immediate opportunity is capturing White's queen with my knight, which would be a significant material gain.

You are a professional chess player and you play as black. Now is your turn to make a move. Before making a move you can pick one of the following actions:
- 'get_current_board' to get the schema and current status of the board
- 'get_legal_moves' to get a UCI formatted list of available moves
- 'make_move <UCI formatted move>' when you are ready to complete your turn (e.g., 'make_move e2e4')

After analyzing the position and available moves, I notice several key factors:

1. I have two knights (on c4 and c6) and two bishops (on g5 and f8) developed
2. White has a knight on g4 that could be threatening my bishop on g5
3. My king is still in the center (e8)

Given the position, I should prioritize king safety by castling. Castling kingside (O-O) is available with the move f8g8.

The knight on c4 has some good outposts, and I see that my bishop on g5 is actively placed. Looking at the position, I think I should continue development and improve my position.

One of the strongest moves appears to be developing my rook to connect them, while also preparing to castle:

The knight on c4 has a nice outpost and can potentially fork pieces with moves like c4e3 or c4d2. The bishop on g5 is actively placed and pinning White's knight on g4 against the queen.

One strong move I see is to attack White's queen with my knight:

3. My king is on g8 with a rook on h8

One of my strongest pieces is the knight on e3, which is deep in White's territory. I should consider either maintaining this strong outpost or using it to create a tactical threat.

The knight on e3 has several good options, including e3g4 which attacks White's h-pawn, or e3c4 which could pressure White's d-pawn.

I'll choose to move my knight from e3 to c4, creating pressure on White's d-pawn while maintaining my knight in a strong central position.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

After analyzing the position, I see several good options. The most critical aspects of the position are:

1. My king safety (I need to be careful about White's queen on d4)
2. My active bishop on g5 which is pinning White's knight to their queen
3. My knight on e4 which is well-positioned in the center

One of the strongest moves appears to be the knight fork with e4f2+, which would check the king and attack the rook on a1 simultaneously.

After analyzing the position and my available moves, I see several interesting options:

1. My knight on f2 is active and can make several strong moves
2. I have a bishop on g5 that's attacking the white queen
3. I have a pawn on e5 that could advance

The most critical aspect of the position is that my bishop on g5 is pinning White's queen to their king. I should capitalize on this tactical opportunity.

I'll move my knight from f2 to e4, which attacks White's queen while maintaining the pin with my bishop. This creates a double attack.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

I need to analyze the position carefully before making my move.

Looking at the board, I notice:
- White has a queen on f3 and a knight on f6
- I have two knights (c6 and e4) and a bishop on g5
- My king is on g8 with a rook on h8
- White's king is on e1

One of my strongest pieces is the bishop on g5, which is attacking White's queen. However, if I move it, White's knight on f6 is threatening my h8 rook.

The knight on e4 is well-positioned and putting pressure on several squares. My knight on c6 is also active.

I think one of my best moves is to play Nxf6+, capturing White's knight with my e4 knight. This would:
1. Remove the knight that's threatening my rook
2. Give check to White's king
3. After White recaptures (likely with the queen), I can move my bishop to safety

After analyzing the position, I see several key factors:

1. I'm playing as Black and have a queen on d8 and a bishop on g5
2. White has a queen on c3 threatening my bishop on g5
3. My knight on f6 is well-positioned
4. I need to address the threat to my bishop

The most pressing issue is my bishop on g5 being attacked by White's queen. I should either move it to safety or defend it.

Looking at the legal moves, I have several good options for the bishop:
- g5h4 (retreating while maintaining some activity)
- g5f4 (retreating to a diagonal that controls important squares)
- g5e3 (retreating but maintaining pressure on the center)

I'll choose to retreat the bishop to h4, maintaining some activity while getting out of the queen's attack.

I see that I'm playing as Black and there's a white queen on c3 that's attacking my position. My king is on g8, and I notice White's rook on d4 is also a threat. My h4 bishop is undefended, and there's a potential threat from White's queen to my knight on f6.

Looking at my legal moves, I need to prioritize safety and development. The move that stands out is:

make_move g8f8

This move gets my king away from the g-file, which could become dangerous, and maintains my castled position. It's a solid defensive move that keeps my king safe while I prepare to counter White's threats.

- My king is on g8 with a rook on f8
- I have a knight on f6 which is well-positioned
- I have a bishop on h4 that seems active
- The e5 pawn is advanced but potentially vulnerable

The position appears somewhat tense. I need to consider both defensive needs and potential counterplay.

One strong candidate move is to complete my kingside castle with Rook f8 to g8 (f8g8), which would connect my rooks and improve my king's safety.

Another interesting option is to develop my bishop with h4g3, putting pressure on White's position.

After consideration, I believe the most principled move is to complete my castling.

2. White has a queen on b2 threatening my queenside
3. I have a knight on f6 and a bishop on h4
4. White has a rook on d3 and the white king is on e1

Looking at my legal moves, I need to address some immediate concerns:

- My queen on d8 is undefended and could be targeted
- The bishop on h4 is actively placed but could be improved
- My knight on f6 has several potential moves

I think the most active move is to develop my bishop further with:

make_move h4g3

This move puts pressure on White's kingside, threatens the f2 pawn (if it were there), and maintains an active piece. The bishop on g3 will be well-positioned to participate in any kingside operations while being relatively safe.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

After analyzing the position, I can see I'm playing as Black and have several options. I notice my king is on g8, and I have a knight on f6 and a bishop on g3 that are actively placed.

The white queen is on f2, which could be threatening, and there's a white rook on d4. I should consider both defensive needs and active possibilities.

Looking at my knight on f6, it has several good options, including e4 which would attack the white queen. My bishop on g3 also has some active squares.

I'll play the knight move to e4, attacking the white queen while developing my position:

After analyzing the position, I see that I'm playing as Black and have several interesting options. 

I notice my knight on e4 is active and can make several moves. I also have a bishop on g3 that's targeting the queenside. The pawn structure shows I have an advanced pawn on e4 that's facing a white pawn on d4.

One strong move I see is to develop my bishop on g3 to h4, which would pin White's queen against their king. This creates immediate tactical pressure.

One of the strongest moves here would be to develop my bishop on h4 further with a pin on the f2 square, which appears to be undefended:

I notice several key aspects of the position:
- I have a knight on e4 and a bishop on f2
- White has a bishop on b4 threatening my queenside
- My king is on g8 with rooks on a8 and h8
- The position appears to be in the middle game

Looking at my options, I see some strong possibilities:

1. The bishop on f2 has several good moves, including Bg3 which would attack White's king on f1
2. The knight on e4 is well-positioned but could be improved
3. I could develop my king's position with Kf8

After careful consideration, I'll play Bg3, which puts pressure on White's king position and maintains my strong piece activity.

2. The bishop on g3 is actively placed on the long diagonal
3. I could develop my queen or improve my king's safety

After evaluation, I'll make a move with my knight from e4 to c3, forking White's rook and potentially another piece:

You are a professional chess player and you play as black. Now is your turn to make a move. Before making a move you can pick one of the following actions:
- 'get_current_board' to get the schema and current status of the board
- 'get_legal_moves' to get a UCI formatted list of available moves
- 'make_move <UCI formatted move>' when you are ready to complete your turn (e.g., 'make_move e2e4')

Player_Black (to Proxy):

I can see the current position and my legal moves. Let me analyze the situation:

1. I'm playing as Black and my king is on g8
2. White has a bishop on a4 threatening my queenside
3. I have a knight on e2 that's active in White's territory
4. I have a bishop on g3 that's also active
5. White's king is on g1, somewhat exposed

Looking at my options, I see several strong possibilities:
- The knight on e2 can deliver check with Ng1
- The bishop on g3 has several good moves, including Bh2 which would attack White's rook

I think the strongest move is to use my knight to deliver check, which will force White to respond and give me initiative.

2. White has a rook on d4 and a bishop on a4
3. My king is on g8 with the rook on h8 and f8 still available for castling

Looking at my options, I notice the bishop on g3 has several strong diagonal moves. The bishop on g3 is particularly active and can target White's kingside.

I'll play the bishop move g3e5, which develops my bishop to a strong central square, putting pressure on White's position and controlling important central squares.

4. White's king is on g2 and I have a knight on g1 that appears to be giving check

Let me check what legal moves I have available.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Thank you for the list of legal moves. Let me analyze the position more carefully:

I see that my knight on g1 is indeed giving check to White's king on g2. This is a critical moment, and I should make the most of this check.

Looking at my options:
- I can capture with the knight: g1e2 or g1f3 (though I need to be careful about what happens after)
- I can move my bishop on d4, which is currently undefended
- My bishop on d8 is under attack by White's rook on d4

The most pressing issue is responding to the check I'm giving. Let me evaluate the knight moves:
- g1e2 would move my knight away from the king but doesn't seem to gain material
- g1f3 would attack White's queen if there was one there, but I don't see a queen

The bishop on d4 is undefended but also attacking White's position. Moving it to f2 (d4f2) would fork White's king and rook, which seems very strong.

I'll make this move:

Player_Black (to Proxy):

After analyzing the position, I see several strong options. I notice I have my queen on g3 with active attacking possibilities, a knight on g1, and bishops on e3 and c8.

The position looks quite tactical with my queen and bishop already positioned aggressively. I should look to increase the pressure on White's position.

One of the strongest moves appears to be `g3f2`, attacking White's king on f1 with my queen. This puts immediate pressure on White and forces a response.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

I need to analyze this position carefully. 

I see that I'm playing as Black and have several pieces that can move. Let me assess the position:

1. My king is on g8 with the rook on h8 and f8
2. I have a knight on g1 that can move
3. I have a bishop on e3 with several possible moves
4. White has a bishop on c3 that's attacking my d4 square
5. White has a rook on f6 that could be threatening my position
6. White's king is on f6

Looking at my options, I notice my bishop on e3 has good mobility and my knight on g1 could develop into an active position. The knight on g1 seems to be in an unusual but potentially strong position.

I'll move my knight from g1 to f3, which puts pressure on White's position and develops my piece to a more active square.

2. White has a rook on e5 and a bishop on c3
3. My king is on g8 with rooks on b8 and g8
4. The pawn structure is relatively intact

Looking at my options, I notice:
- The knight on e5 has several potential moves
- I could develop my pieces further
- I should consider king safety

The knight on e5 is well-positioned but potentially under threat from the rook on e5. Moving it to c4 would attack White's a-pawn while maintaining a central influence.

The move Nc4xe5 looks particularly strong as it captures White's rook. This would be a material gain of a rook for a knight, which is very favorable.

After analyzing the position, I can see I'm playing as Black with my king on g8. I have a knight on f3 that's very active in White's territory, and I need to consider my best move.

The knight on f3 has several strong options, including attacking White's rook on e1 or potentially forking pieces. I also notice my king is somewhat exposed with the White bishop on c3 pointing toward my kingside.

One of the strongest moves appears to be using my knight to attack White's rook:

You are a professional chess player and you play as black. Now is your turn to make a move. Before making a move you can pick one of the following actions:
- 'get_current_board' to get the schema and current status of the board
- 'get_legal_moves' to get a UCI formatted list of available moves
- 'make_move <UCI formatted move>' when you are ready to complete your turn (e.g., 'make_move e2e4')

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

I need to analyze the position carefully before making my move.

Looking at the board, I see that:
- I'm playing as Black with my king on g8
- I have a rook on g8, a bishop on c8, and a knight on e1
- White has a rook on b8, a bishop on c6, and the king on f1
- The pawn structure is somewhat broken on both sides

The knight on e1 is very active and potentially threatening White's position. My king is currently in the corner with the rook protecting it. 

Among my legal moves, I should consider:
1. King safety - moving my king to a safer square
2. Improving my piece activity
3. Addressing any immediate threats

The knight on e1 is well-placed and putting pressure on White's position. I should consider keeping it there or moving it to an even better square.

I'll move my king to f8, which improves my king's position by moving it away from the corner while maintaining protection from my rook.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

I need to analyze this position carefully. 

I see that I'm playing as Black with my king on h8. White has a rook on c8 and a bishop on c6, while I have a rook on f8 and a knight on e1. There's a material imbalance, but I have a knight attacking White's king on f1.

Looking at the legal moves, I notice I can move my knight on e1 to several squares. The most aggressive option would be to check the White king with e1g2, but I should consider if there are any defensive needs first.

My king on h8 is somewhat exposed, and White's rook on c8 is threatening my position. I should consider either defending with my rook or moving my king to g8.

After evaluation, I believe the best move is to move my king to g8, improving its safety.

Looking at my options, I notice my rook on f8 is protecting my king, but I could improve my position by moving my king to h8, which would be safer.

I have several good options here, but I think the most pressing is to improve my king's safety by moving it away from the h-file. Since I have the option to castle queenside (which would be unusual but legal in this position), I'll take it:

One of the strongest moves here would be to protect my king by moving it away from the h-file, which would also connect my rooks:

- White has a rook on c8 that's attacking my position
- White has a bishop on c3 and the white king is on f1
- I have a knight on e1 that's deep in White's territory

The most pressing issue is the white rook on c8 which is threatening my position. I should address this threat immediately.

Looking at my legal moves, I have several options:
1. I could move my king to h8 (g8h8)
2. I could move my rook to defend against the white rook with f8e8 or f8d8
3. I could capture the white rook with f8c8

Capturing the white rook seems like the best option as it eliminates the immediate threat and gives me material advantage.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

I can see the current position and my legal moves. Let me analyze the situation:

As Black, I have:
- A king on g8
- A rook on c8
- A knight on e1
- Pawns on a7, b7, d7, e4, f7, g7, h7

White has:
- A king on f1
- A bishop on c3
- Pawns on a3, b4, h4

Looking at my options, I notice several strong possibilities:

1. My knight on e1 is deep in White's territory and can capture material or deliver checks
2. My rook on c8 has open files to utilize
3. I have a passed pawn on e4 that could be advanced

The knight on e1 is particularly strong, and I should consider moves like e1c2 or e1g2 which attack White's pawns.

After careful consideration, I'll move my knight to c2, which attacks White's b4 pawn and maintains my knight in a strong position.

- White has a bishop on c3, king on f1, and some pawns
- Material is roughly even
- My knight on c2 is active deep in White's territory

Among my options:
- The knight on c2 is a strong piece that can threaten multiple targets
- My rook on c8 has an open file
- I should consider both attacking opportunities and king safety

The knight on c2 is particularly well-placed and can make several strong moves. The move c2e1 looks especially powerful as it would check the white king.

After analyzing the position, I can see I'm playing as Black with a rook on c8, a king on g8, a knight on e1, and several pawns. White has a king on f1, a bishop on b4, and some pawns.

I notice my knight on e1 is attacking White's position, which is unusual and advantageous. My rook on c8 is also active. Looking at the legal moves, I have several strong options:

1. I could move my knight with e1f3, e1d3, e1g2, or e1c2
2. I could reposition my rook along the c-file or 8th rank
3. I could advance various pawns

The knight on e1 is in a very strong position, potentially forking pieces. I'll move it to f3, which attacks the h2 pawn and maintains pressure in White's position.

I see I have a rook on c8, a knight on f3, and my king on g8. White has a bishop on c3 and king on f1. Material is roughly equal, but I have a knight attacking White's position.

Key observations:
- My knight on f3 is well-positioned and has several good options
- I have a pawn on e4 that could advance
- My rook on c8 could be developed

Looking at the best moves:
1. The knight on f3 has strong options - particularly e5 which would attack the bishop on c3
2. Advancing the e4 pawn to e3 would create pressure
3. Moving the rook along the c-file could be useful

After consideration, I'll move my knight to e5, attacking White's bishop and improving my position.

- My rook on c8 controls the c-file
- I have a pawn on e4 that's quite advanced

The knight on e5 is particularly well-placed, and I should consider if I want to move it. However, I see that my e4 pawn is undefended and could be captured. Advancing it to e3 would increase its threat value.

I'll advance my e-pawn to increase pressure in the center and create more threats.

The most forcing and strongest move is to check the white king with my knight, which also threatens a fork if the king moves to certain squares.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Looking at the current position, I need to make a strategic decision as Black. 

I notice I have a rook on c8 and a knight on g5, with my king on g8. White has a bishop on b3 and their king on e5. Material seems roughly equal, but I need to improve my position.

The most active and strong move appears to be moving my rook to control the c-file, particularly targeting the second rank where I might create threats. This gives me control of an open file and increases my rook's activity.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

I need to analyze the position carefully before making my move.

Looking at the board, I see that:
- I'm playing as Black with my king on g8
- White's king is on f1
- I have a rook on c2 which is very active
- I have a knight on g5
- The pawn structure is somewhat broken on both sides

The most powerful piece I have is the rook on c2, which is already in a great position on the 2nd rank. I can use it to deliver a check or potentially win material.

The move c2c1+ stands out as it gives check to the White king. This would force the king to move and could lead to a tactical advantage.

I'll make this move:

Key observations:

- I have a knight on g5 that has several possible moves
- My pawn structure is mostly intact

Looking at the position, I notice my knight on g5 is active and could potentially create threats. The e4 square looks particularly attractive as it would put pressure on the f2 square (though it's not visible on the current board).

I'll move my knight to e4, which improves its position and creates more central influence.

One strong move would be to advance my knight to f2, which would fork the white king on f1 and potentially another piece. This would create an immediate tactical threat.

I'll move my knight from f2 to h3, which puts pressure on White's position and maintains my knight's active placement.

Let me analyze the position:

I'm playing as Black with my king on g8. I have a knight on g6 and pawns on b7, d7, e3, f7, and h7. White has a king on f1, a bishop on g5, and pawns on a7, a6, and h4.

Looking at my legal moves, I need to consider:
1. King safety - no immediate checks appear
2. Piece activity - my knight on g6 has several options
3. Pawn structure - I have several pawn moves available

The most concerning piece is White's bishop on g5, which is attacking diagonally. I should consider either defending against potential threats or improving my position.

Among my options, advancing my e-pawn looks strong as it's already quite advanced and could become a promotion threat:

1. I can capture the white king with my queen: `e1g1`
2. I can check the white king with my queen: `e1h1`
3. I can move my knight to various squares

Since capturing the king would end the game immediately (though in standard chess this shouldn't be possible as the game would end before the king could be captured), I'll make this move:

I'll make a strong move with my queen to check the White king:

I need to analyze this position carefully to make the best move as Black.

Looking at the board:
- I'm playing as Black with my king on g8
- White has a king on h1 and a bishop on g5
- There's a knight on g6 which is one of my key pieces
- I have pawns on b7, d7, f7, and h7
- White has pawns on a6, h4, and a7

The most pressing concern is the white bishop on g5, which is attacking diagonally. My knight on g6 is a valuable piece that I should try to keep safe.

Among my legal moves, I should consider:
1. Moving my king (g8h8 or g8f8)
2. Moving my knight to safety
3. Advancing pawns strategically

The move f7f5 looks strong as it:
- Advances a pawn toward promotion
- Controls more central squares
- Threatens to advance further

Player_Black (to Proxy):

I'll analyze the position and my available moves:

The position shows I'm playing as Black with my king on g8. White has a bishop on d1 and king on h1. Material is roughly even, but I need to consider the best move.

Key observations:
- My knight on g6 has several options
- I have pawn moves available
- I need to ensure my king's safety

Looking at the knight moves, g6e5 looks promising as it moves to a central square. However, I should check if it's safe there.

The bishop on d1 controls the a4-e5 diagonal, so moving my knight to e5 would lose it. 

My king is safe, so I should focus on improving my position. The move b7b5 advances a pawn and gains space on the queenside, which seems like a solid positional choice.

I see that I'm playing as Black with my king on g8. White has a bishop on g4 and a king on h1. The pawn structure is complex with several pawns for both sides.

Looking at my legal moves, I need to prioritize king safety and piece coordination. The knight on g6 seems to be an active piece that could be used effectively.

After evaluating the position, I'll move my knight to e5, which centralizes it and gives it more control over key squares.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

I need to analyze the position carefully before making my move.

Looking at the board:
- I'm playing as Black with my king on g8
- White has a king on h1 and a bishop on f5
- Material is roughly even, but I have a knight on e5 which is well-positioned
- There are various pawn structures on both sides

My knight on e5 is very strong and centralized. I should consider if there are any tactical opportunities with it. The move e5f7 would be a knight fork attacking both my king and g7 pawn, but that would be a blunder as it's my own knight.

The white bishop on f5 is attacking my pawn on b5. I should consider protecting it or moving it forward.

Given the position, I think advancing my d-pawn is a good strategic choice to gain space and potentially develop my position further.

- White has a king on h6 and a bishop on f6
- I have a knight on e5 which is a strong piece
- The pawn structure shows I have pawns on b5, d5, f5, g7, and h7
- White has pawns on a7, h4, and h5

The knight on e5 is my most active piece. I should consider if there are any tactical opportunities with it. The move e5f3 looks particularly interesting as it would attack White's king and bishop simultaneously - a fork.

Let me check this move: Knight e5 to f3 would attack both the king on h6 and the bishop on f6. This is a winning fork that would guarantee material gain.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

I'll analyze the position as Black:

This is an endgame position where I have a knight (on f3) while White has no minor pieces. Material is roughly equal with both sides having some pawns. My king is on g8, and White's king is on g2.

Looking at the legal moves, I have several options:
- King moves (g8h8, g8f8, g8f7)
- Knight moves from f3
- Various pawn moves

The knight on f3 is very active and centralized. I should consider:
1. Using the knight to attack White's pawns
2. Advancing my pawns to create passed pawns
3. Activating my king

The move f3d4 looks strong as it attacks White's d-pawn while maintaining the knight's central position. This would put pressure on White's position and potentially win material.

- My knight on e2 has several possible moves
- My king can move from f6
- I have pawn moves available

The most critical factor is my knight on e2, which is currently attacking White's king on g7. This is a check situation. I should either capture the king (if legal) or make another strong move with the knight.

Since "e2g1" is listed as a legal move, and this would be a knight fork of White's king and rook, this seems like an excellent choice.

Among my options, advancing my g-pawn looks promising as it creates a potential passed pawn and helps shield my king:

Player_Black (to Proxy):

I need to analyze this position carefully. 

I'm playing as Black with my king on f7. White has a rook on c8 and king on g1. The pawn structure shows I have pawns on b5, d5, f5, g5, and h7, while White has pawns on a3 and h4.

The most pressing concern is the White rook on c8, which is currently not directly threatening my king. My priority should be to improve my king position and maintain control.

Looking at my options:
- Moving my king to g7 (f7g7) would be a good choice to get away from the c-file and prepare to support my pawns
- Moving to e7 (f7e7) would keep me on the same rank as the rook
- Moving to f6 (f7f6) or e6 (f7e6) would be diagonal moves

The move f7g7 seems best as it improves my king position, moves away from the rook's file, and helps protect my h7 pawn.

You are a professional chess player and you play as black. Now is your turn to make a move. Before making a move you can pick one of the following actions:
- 'get_current_board' to get the schema and current status of the board
- 'get_legal_moves' to get a UCI formatted list of available moves
- 'make_move <UCI formatted move>' when you are ready to complete your turn (e.g., 'make_move e2e4')

Player_Black (to Proxy):

I need to analyze this endgame position carefully.

I'm playing as Black with my king on g7 and pawns on h7, b5, d5, f5, and g5. White has a king on g1, a rook on c1, and pawns on a3 and h4.

This is a critical endgame position. My priority is to ensure king safety while advancing my pawns if possible. The h-pawn is particularly important as it's the most advanced.

Looking at the legal moves:
- My king can move to several squares (h8, g8, f8, f7, h6, f6)
- I can advance pawns: h7-h6, g5-g4, f5-f4, d5-d4, b5-b4

The most pressing concern is to create a passed pawn that can promote. The h-pawn is already the most advanced, so advancing it makes sense.

I need to analyze this position carefully. I'm playing as Black with my king on g7, and White has a rook on c6 and king on g1. I have pawns on b5, d5, f5, g5, and h5, while White has pawns on a5 and h4.

The most critical aspect of this position is my king's safety. I notice that White's rook on c6 is controlling the 6th rank, which limits my king's movement. My priority should be to keep my king safe and potentially advance my pawns when possible.

Looking at my legal moves, I have several king moves and pawn advances available. Since there's no immediate threat to my king, I can consider improving my position. Moving my king to f7 seems reasonable as it maintains king safety while potentially supporting my pawns.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

I can see my legal moves now. I'm in a difficult position with my king on f6 being threatened by the white rook on f5. I have five possible king moves:

1. f7g8 (move king to g8)
2. f7e8 (move king to e8)
3. f7g7 (move king to g7)
4. f7e7 (move king to e7)
5. f7f6 (move king to f6)

Wait, there seems to be a discrepancy. The board shows my king on f6, but the legal moves suggest my king is on f7. Let me analyze the actual position I can see on the board:

My king is on f6, and there's a white rook on f5 directly threatening it. I need to move my king away from the f-file to escape the check. Looking at the board, moving to e7 or g7 would be safe options.

Based on the legal moves provided and the actual board position, I'll choose:

I need to carefully analyze this position. As Black, I'm in a critical situation with my king on e7 and White's rook on f6 threatening me. 

Looking at the legal moves:
- Moving my king to e8, d8, d7, or f6
- Advancing pawns on g5, f5, d5, or b5

The most urgent concern is my king's safety. White's rook on f6 is putting pressure on my position. Moving my king to f6 would be illegal due to the rook's control of that square. Moving to e8 or d8 keeps me on the back rank.

I'll choose to move my king to d7, which gets me away from the edge of the board and maintains more flexibility for future moves.

I see my legal moves. Since my king is in check from the white rook on e5, I need to address this immediately. My options are:

1. Move the king: d7d8, d7c8, d7c7, or d7e6
2. Block with a pawn: None possible
3. Capture the rook: Not possible

Looking at the king moves:
- d7d8: Moving to the back rank
- d7c8: Moving to the corner
- d7c7: Moving to the 7th rank
- d7e6: Moving toward the center

The best move here is d7e6, as it moves my king toward the center of the board, which is generally good in endgames. It gets away from the check while maintaining more flexibility for future moves.

Let me check what legal moves I have available.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

I see my legal moves now. Let me analyze the position:

This is a king and pawn endgame where I need to be careful about my king's position and pawn advancement. Looking at the board:

1. My king on e6 can move in several directions
2. I have pawns on b4, d4, f4, g4, and h3
3. White has pawns on a3 and h4, with the king on h6

The most critical aspects in this position are:
- King activity
- Creating passed pawns
- Preventing White's pawns from advancing

Since my king is already quite active in the center, I should consider moving it to support my pawns or to prevent White's king from becoming more active. Moving my king to f7 seems strong as it maintains central control while moving toward White's king and h-pawn.

I see the current position now. I'm playing as Black with my king on f7, and I have pawns on b5, d5, f5, g5, and h5. White has a king on g6 and pawns on a6 and h4.

This appears to be an endgame position where king safety and pawn advancement are crucial. Let me analyze my options:

1. King moves: I can move my king to various squares (g8, f8, e8, g7, e7, f6, e6)
2. Pawn moves: I can advance pawns with g5g4, f5f4, d5d4, or b5b4

Since White's king is on g6, I need to be careful about my king's safety. Moving my king to f8 seems prudent as it maintains control of important squares while staying safe from the white king. This also keeps an eye on my pawns.

I can see the current position. This appears to be an endgame position where:
- Black has a king on f8 and pawns on b4, d4, f4, g4, and h3
- White has a king on g2 and pawns on a3 and h4

Let me check what legal moves I have as Black.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Thank you for providing the legal moves. Let me analyze the position:

I notice there's a discrepancy between the board display and the legal moves. The board shows pawns at b4, d4, f4, g4, and h3, but the legal moves suggest pawns at b5, d5, f5, and g5. I'll work with the legal moves provided.

Looking at the position strategically:
1. I should consider king activity and pawn advancement
2. I need to be careful about creating weaknesses

Among my options:
- King moves (f8g8, f8e8, f8g7, f8f7, f8e7)
- Pawn moves (g5g4, f5f4, d5d4, b5b4)

I'll advance my d-pawn to create a passed pawn, which could be decisive in this endgame.

I can see all my legal moves now. Let me analyze the position:

1. I'm playing as Black with my king on f8
2. White's king is on h6
3. There's a pawn structure with pawns on both sides
4. I have several pawn moves available and king moves

Looking at the position, I notice my king is currently safe, but I should consider improving my position. Since this appears to be an endgame, activating my king would be beneficial. Moving toward the center is generally good in endgames.

I'll move my king to e7, which centralizes it and maintains control of important squares.

Now I can see all my legal moves. Since White has played the unusual Nh3, I'll respond with a solid opening move.

I'll play 1...e5, which is a strong classical response that immediately stakes a claim in the center. This move helps control the center, opens lines for my bishop and queen, and prepares for further development.

Thank you for providing the legal moves. I see that I have the option to castle kingside with e8g8, which is a strong move in this position.

Castling kingside will:
1. Bring my king to safety
2. Connect my rooks
3. Prepare to use the h8-rook for development along the central files

This is a natural developing move that aligns with standard opening principles. I'll castle kingside now.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Thank you for providing the legal moves. Let me analyze the position and make a decision.

Looking at my options, I need to continue development and ensure my king's safety. I notice I can castle kingside with g8h8, which is generally a good idea to secure the king.

Other strong candidate moves include:
- f8e8 (connecting my rooks)
- d7d6 or d7d5 (central pawn advance)
- f6d5 (knight to a central square)

Castling is a priority in the opening, as it secures my king and connects my rooks. This will allow me to focus on counterplay in the center and on the queenside.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

I can see all my legal moves now. Let me analyze the position:

I notice I'm playing as Black and the position appears to be in the middle game. I have both knights developed, my dark-squared bishop is on e7, and my king is still on g8. White has a pawn on c3 that's attacking my knight on d4, and there's a central pawn structure to consider.

Looking at my options, I should prioritize piece safety and development. My knight on f6 is well-placed, controlling important central squares. The knight on c6 has some good options.

One strong move would be to develop my light-squared bishop with Bf8-e8, connecting my rooks. Alternatively, I could consider knight moves that improve my position.

After careful consideration, I'll play the knight move to d4, which puts pressure on White's center and develops my piece to a strong central square.

- White has a pawn on e4 that could be captured
- My king is still on its starting square with castling still available

One of the strongest moves appears to be capturing White's e4 pawn with my knight, which would win material and maintain my knight's central position:

I notice that:

- My knight on e2 is attacking White's queen on d4
- I have a knight on f6 and bishops on c8 and e7
- The pawn structure is relatively intact

The most striking feature is my knight on e2, which is a strong outpost. I should capitalize on this advantage.

The best move appears to be to capture White's queen with my knight:

4. White has a bishop on a3 targeting my queenside

After evaluating the position, I think one of my strongest moves is to develop my knight on c5 to e4, where it attacks White's queen and puts pressure in the center.

After analyzing the position and my available moves, I notice several key factors:

1. My king is on h8 and I have potential castling options (h8g8, f8g8)
2. I have knights on f6 and e4 with multiple tactical possibilities
3. My bishop on e7 can move to several squares

The knight on e4 is particularly active and could potentially fork pieces. Looking at the position, I see my knight on e4 can attack White's queen on a4 while also threatening other pieces.

I'll play a strong knight move that puts pressure on White's queen:

After analyzing the position, I see several interesting options. I notice that:

1. My knight on c3 has multiple active squares
2. I have a bishop on e7 that could develop
3. My e5 pawn is advanced but potentially vulnerable

Given the position, I'll play a strong developing move with my knight on c3, bringing it to e4 where it controls central squares and puts pressure on White's position.

I'm playing as Black and have several interesting options. I notice:
- White has a bishop on a3 threatening my queenside
- White's queen is on a4, which could be threatening
- I have knights on f6 and e4, with my e4 knight being quite active
- My king is on g8 with some pawn protection

After evaluating the position, I see that my knight on e4 is very well placed and has several strong options. One particularly attractive move is to fork White's king and rook with Nf2+, which would give me a check and threaten to capture the rook on h1.

4. I have knights on f6 and f3, and bishops on e7 and c8

Let me check what legal moves I have available.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Thank you for providing the legal moves. Let me analyze the position and make a decision.

Looking at the board, I notice several important factors:
- My knight on f3 is quite active and attacking White's position
- White's queen on c3 is quite active
- I need to be careful about potential threats

After analyzing the available moves, I see that my knight on f3 has several strong options. Moving it to d3 looks particularly strong as it attacks White's bishop on b2 and potentially creates a fork threat against White's king on c3.

- My knight on d3 is active and has several good options
- I have a pawn on e5 that could advance
- My king is on g8 with castling no longer available

Among my options, I see some strong candidate moves:
- Knight d3-f4 would capture White's knight
- Knight d3-f2 could fork White's king and rook
- Knight d3-b2 could threaten White's pawn
- Advancing e5-e4 could gain space

After evaluation, the knight move to f2 looks particularly strong as it creates a fork between White's king on c3 and rook on h1.

I also see I have two knights - one on f6 and one on f2. The knight on f2 is particularly active and could make some interesting moves.

Looking at the overall position, I think castling is my priority since my king is still on its starting square.

Looking at my options, I see a strong move with my knight on f2, which is already well-positioned. I can attack White's queen with Nf2-d3, creating a fork between the queen and the bishop on b2.

I can see the current board position. Let me analyze what's happening:

1. White's queen is on c6, attacking my knight on f6
2. White has a bishop on d3 and another on b2
3. My king is on g8 and I need to be careful about potential threats

Let me check what legal moves I have available.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Thank you for providing the legal moves. Let me analyze the position and make the best move.

I notice that White's queen on c6 is threatening my knight on f6. I need to address this threat. Looking at my options:

1. I could capture the queen with either d7c6 or b7c6, but this would likely be followed by recapture.
2. I could move the knight to safety with several options (e8, h5, d5, g4, or e4).
3. I could defend the knight with another piece.

Among the knight moves, Nd5 (f6d5) looks strong as it:
- Escapes the queen's attack
- Maintains central control
- Threatens White's c-pawn
- Could potentially fork White's pieces later

I'll make this move:

After analyzing the position and my legal moves, I notice my knight on d5 is under attack from White's queen on c3. I need to address this threat immediately.

Looking at the options, I see that I can capture the queen with Nd5xc3, which would be a great trade (knight for queen). This move is represented as "d5c3" in the list of legal moves.

After analyzing the position, I notice several important factors:

1. White has a queen on h5 threatening my king's position
2. My knight on c3 is active and has several good options
3. I need to address the queen threat while developing my pieces

The knight on c3 is particularly well-placed and can make several strong moves. One of the best options is to play Nc3-e4, which:
- Attacks White's queen on h5
- Centralizes my knight to a strong outpost
- Creates threats against White's position

This forces White to move the queen and gives me the initiative.

After analyzing the position, I see that I'm playing as Black and have several interesting options. 

I notice my knight on e4 is quite active and can make several moves. I also have a bishop on e7 that could be developed. The pawn on e5 is under attack by White's pawn on d4, and I need to consider that.

One of the strongest moves here would be to capture the bishop on d4 with my pawn from e5, which would remove a strong attacking piece and strengthen my center.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

I'll analyze the position as Black:

The position looks complex with my king castled kingside. I notice White has a queen on h5 which could be threatening, and there's a bishop on d4 that's also active. My knight on e4 is well-placed in the center and could be a strong piece.

Looking at my options, I should consider:
1. Defending against any immediate threats
2. Improving my piece coordination
3. Countering White's active pieces

The knight on e4 is a strong piece that I should consider keeping or using for a tactical advantage. Moving it to f6 would defend against the queen on h5 and control important central squares.

I'll make this move:

After analyzing the position, I see several key elements:

1. I'm playing as Black and my king is on g8
2. White's queen is on h5, creating some pressure
3. I have a bishop on e7 that's currently pinned to my king by White's queen
4. My knight on f6 has several options

The most concerning aspect is White's queen on h5 which is threatening my kingside. I need to address this threat while developing my pieces.

One of the strongest moves here is to castle kingside, which would move my king to safety and connect my rooks:

After analyzing the position, I see several interesting options. I notice that:

1. My king is on h8 and can move to g8
2. I have a knight on f6 that has several potential moves
3. My bishop on e7 has diagonal options
4. I have a pawn on d4 that appears to be advanced

Looking at the position, I should prioritize development and king safety. The white queen is on h5, which could be threatening, so I should be careful about that.

One strong move would be to castle kingside, which would connect my rooks and improve my king's safety.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

I see that I only have one legal move available: f6h7. This means I need to move my knight from f6 to h7.

Looking at the position, I can see why this is my only option. White's queen is on h6 delivering a check to my king on g8. The only way to address this check is to block it with my knight by moving it from f6 to h7.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

I'll analyze the position:

The board shows an unusual position with White's king on b2 and several pieces developed. As Black, I have my king on g8, a queen on d8, and various other pieces in their starting positions or slightly developed.

Looking at the legal moves, I notice I have several strong options:
- I could develop my bishop with e7c5, which would put pressure on White's position
- I could castle with g8f8 to improve king safety
- I could advance my d-pawn with d7d5 to control the center

The bishop on e7 has good mobility, and moving it to c5 would create a strong diagonal threat toward White's king area. This seems like the most active and purposeful move.

Now I have a clear picture of the position and my available moves. Let me analyze the situation:

1. My king is on g8 with the option to move to f8 or e8
2. I have a bishop on c5 with multiple options
3. I have a knight on h7 that can move
4. I have a pawn on d4 that can advance
5. My queen on d8 has several options

Looking at the position, I notice my bishop on c5 is well-placed on the long diagonal. My pawn on d4 is advanced and could be pushed further. White's king is exposed on b2, which might present tactical opportunities.

One of the strongest moves appears to be advancing my d-pawn to d3, which puts pressure on White's position and threatens to promote. This pawn is already quite advanced and supported by my bishop on c5.

After careful consideration, I'll play the bishop check:

- The bishop on f2 has many good moves, including Bf2-e3 which would attack White's king on b3
- I could develop my queen with Qd8-f6 or Qd8-e7
- I could castle with Kg8-f8 or Kg8-e8

Given White's king is exposed on b3 and my bishop is already threatening it, I'll play Bf2-e3+, checking the White king and maintaining pressure.

One of my strongest moves is to develop my dark-squared bishop on e3, which is currently attacking multiple squares. I can use it to put pressure on White's position.

I'll play the bishop move e3f4, which develops my bishop to a strong central square, puts pressure on White's position, and maintains my piece activity.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Now I have a clear picture of the position and my available moves. Let me analyze the situation:

1. I notice my king is on g8 and there appears to be some pressure on the kingside
2. I have a bishop on f4 that's actively placed and could make several moves
3. White's king is exposed on b2, which might present tactical opportunities
4. I have several pawn moves available to improve my position

Looking at my options, the bishop on f4 is particularly active and could potentially create threats. The move f4-h2 looks especially interesting as it would attack White's king.

I'll make this move:

2. I have a bishop on h2 that's deep in enemy territory and could be developed further
3. There are potential pawn advances to consider

The bishop on h2 is particularly active and can make a strong move. I'll use it to control more of the center and potentially threaten White's position.

After analyzing the position, I can see several interesting options:

1. I notice my king is on g8 and appears to be under some pressure with White's rook on h4 and bishop on b3 potentially creating threats.

2. My dark-squared bishop on e5 is active and has several good moves available.

3. I have a pawn on d3 that can advance to d2, which could be strong.

Looking at the position more carefully, advancing my d3 pawn to d2 seems particularly strong as it threatens to promote and puts immediate pressure on White's king on b2.

- My king on g8 is somewhat exposed
- I have a bishop on e5 that's active
- White has a rook on h4 and g7 that could be threatening

The most powerful move available is clearly promoting my d2 pawn to a queen:

The position is quite unusual with two black queens (one on d8 and one on d1). I notice my king is on g8, and I have a bishop on e5 that's attacking diagonally.

Looking at the legal moves, I see several strong options with my queen on d1, which appears to be free to move in many directions. Since the white king is exposed on b2, I can create a powerful threat.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

After analyzing the position and the legal moves, I see several strong options. As Black, I have two queens and should use them effectively.

The white king is exposed on c6, and I notice my queen on c2 can deliver a check by moving to c3. This would force the white king to move and could lead to a tactical advantage.

Additionally, I see that my bishop on e5 is attacking the white rook on h8, which could be a good capture.

Given these observations, I'll make what I believe is the strongest move:

make_move c2c3

This queen check forces the white king to move, likely to b5 or d5, after which I can continue to apply pressure with my pieces. This should give me a significant advantage in the position.

I see the current position. This is quite an unusual position with both kings exposed and multiple queens on the board. Let me check what legal moves I have as Black.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

After analyzing the position and legal moves, I see that I have a very strong move available. My king is on g8, and I have a second queen on c3 that can deliver a decisive check.

I'll play:

make_move c3e3

This move checks the white king on d4 with my queen from c3. The white king has no escape squares, and there are no pieces that can block or capture my queen. This is checkmate.

After analyzing the position, I notice several important factors:

1. I have two queens (one on d8 and one on e3)
2. White's king is exposed on d4
3. I have a bishop on e5 that can attack

Looking at my legal moves, I see an opportunity for a decisive tactic. The queen on e3 can deliver a check while being protected and simultaneously attacking other pieces.

4. White has a rook on d4 that's currently pinned by my bishop

One of the strongest moves I have is to increase the pressure on White's king with my queen. I can play Qd8-f6, which creates a powerful attack and threatens mate.

After analyzing the position, I see several key factors:

1. White's king is exposed on d4
2. I have my queen on f6 with potential attacking opportunities
3. My bishop on e5 is well-positioned and could be part of an attack

The most promising move appears to be to attack with my queen while maintaining pressure. I'll play:

make_move f6d4

Player_Black (to Proxy):

I apologize for the error. Let me check the legal moves again and make a valid move.

Looking at the legal moves list, I see that f6d4 is not actually legal. Let me reconsider the position.

Since the white king is on d4 and my queen is on f6, I can't directly capture the king (as that would be an illegal move in chess). Let me choose one of the strongest moves from the legal moves list:

4. I have a knight on h7 that's somewhat out of play

The bishop on e5 is my most active piece and has several good options. I notice I can capture the white bishop on b2 with my bishop, which would be a material gain.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

After analyzing the position, I see several key factors:

1. My king is in check from the white rook on e5
2. I need to address this check immediately
3. I have three ways to handle the check:
   - Move the king (g8f8 or g8e8)
   - Block the check (h7f8)
   - Capture the checking piece (not possible here)

Looking at my options:
- Moving to f8 seems safest as it gets out of the check and maintains king safety
- Moving to e8 would put me in line with the other white rook on c5
- Blocking with the knight (h7f8) would sacrifice my knight since it would be captured

I'll choose the safest option:

After analyzing the position, I can see several important factors:

2. White has a rook on e5 and f4, and a bishop on b4
3. White's king is on c3, which is quite exposed
4. I have a bishop on c3 that's attacking White's position
5. I have several pawn moves available

One of my strongest moves appears to be moving my bishop on c3 to attack White's pieces. I can also consider castling queenside with my king and rook.

After evaluating the options, I'll move my bishop to capture White's rook on f6, which appears to be a strong attacking move.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Let me analyze the position:

I see that White has two rooks on e5 and f4, with the king on c3. As Black, I have a knight on h7, bishops on f6 and f8, rooks on a8 and f8, and my king on h8. The position looks complex with some tactical opportunities.

Looking at my legal moves, I notice:
- My king can move to g8
- My rook on f8 can move to g8 or e8
- My knight on h7 can move to g5
- My bishop on f6 has several options including g5, e5, h4, d4, c3, b2, a1
- I have several pawn moves available

The most critical aspect is my king's safety. White's rook on e5 is attacking along the e-file, and the rook on f4 could potentially deliver a check. 

I'll play the knight move h7-g5, which develops my knight to a more active square, controls important central squares, and prepares potential threats against White's position.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

I need to analyze this position carefully. 

I notice that:
- White has a rook on e5 and f4, and a bishop on d1
- My king is on h8 with a rook on f8 and a8
- I have knights on g5 and bishops on f6
- The material seems roughly equal
- White's king is on c3, which is quite exposed

Looking at my legal moves, I should consider:
1. King safety - moving my king to g8 might be safer
2. Developing my pieces further
3. Potential attacks against White's exposed king

The move h8g8 (moving my king from h8 to g8) seems strong as it improves my king's safety by moving away from the edge of the board and potentially setting up a rook connection.

I need to address the immediate threat from the rook on e5. One strong move would be to move my knight from g5 to e6, which attacks the rook on e5 while also protecting my f8 rook.

4. White's king is on c3, far from my pieces

The most urgent issue is my knight on e6 being attacked. I should either move it to safety or defend it. Among the knight moves, g5 looks promising as it attacks White's rook on f6.

1. White has a rook on e8 that's attacking my king on g8
2. I have a knight on g5 that could potentially move
3. There's a white rook on f2 and a white king on c4
4. I need to address the check from the rook on e8

Let me check my legal moves to respond to this check.

Now I understand my options. I'm in check from the rook on e8, and I have several ways to respond:

1. `g8h8` - Moving my king to h8
2. `f8e8` - Capturing the checking rook with my own rook
3. Several knight and pawn moves are also available

The most direct response is to capture the checking rook with my rook. This eliminates the immediate threat and gives me a material advantage.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

I need to analyze this position carefully. As Black, I see:

1. My king is on g8 with the rook on e8 and a8
2. White has a king on c3 with a rook on f2 and a bishop on d1
3. White's king is quite exposed in the center
4. I have a knight on g5 that could be useful for attack

Looking at my options, I notice I can potentially create threats with my knight or develop my position. The e-file is open and my rook on e8 controls it.

I'll play a strong move that improves my position and puts pressure on White:

I can see the current position and my legal moves. Let me analyze the situation:

1. I'm playing as Black and have a rook on e1 which is attacking the White king on c3
2. White's king is on c3 with limited mobility
3. I have a knight on g5 that could potentially be part of an attack
4. I have a rook on a8 and my king is on g8

Looking at my options, I notice my rook on e1 is already putting pressure on White's king. I should try to coordinate my pieces to increase the attack. The most direct approach would be to bring my other rook into the attack.

I'll move my rook from a8 to b8, which maintains control of the back rank while positioning it for potential use on the b-file or to swing across to the center later.

2. I have a knight on g5 with several possible moves
3. My king is on g8 with the option to move to f8
4. I have several pawn moves available

The most immediate opportunity I see is capturing the white bishop on e5 with my rook, which would win a piece.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

I apologize for the error. Let me check the legal moves again and make a valid move.

Looking at the legal moves list, I see that "e1e5" isn't actually listed as legal. Let me review the board again.

I notice my rook is on e1, but capturing the bishop on e5 must not be a legal move. This could be because there's something blocking the path that I didn't see clearly in the board representation.

Let me choose another strong move from the legal moves list. Taking the white rook on h1 seems like a good option.

2. My knight on g5 has several potential moves
3. My king on g8 can move to f8
4. I have several pawn moves available

The most pressing issue is that White's rook on h3 is threatening my g7 pawn, and White's bishop on e5 is controlling important diagonals. My knight on g5 is well-positioned and could potentially fork pieces.

I'll make a move with my rook on h1 to the e-file, putting pressure on White's bishop and creating threats:

- I have a rook on e8 that could be developed

Looking at the legal moves, I need to consider my king safety and potential counterplay. The most pressing issue is to ensure my king is safe.

Moving my king to f8 seems prudent as it gets away from the h-file where White has some activity. This also connects my rooks.

2. White has a bishop on h4 and a rook on h3 that could be threatening.
3. My knight on g5 has several options.
4. I have various pawn moves available.

Castling would be a good defensive move to improve my king's safety. The king will move to g8 and the rook will move to f8, creating a more secure position.

You are a professional chess player and you play as black. Now is your turn to make a move. Before making a move you can pick one of the following actions:
- 'get_current_board' to get the schema and current status of the board
- 'get_legal_moves' to get a UCI formatted list of available moves
- 'make_move <UCI formatted move>' when you are ready to complete your turn (e.g., 'make_move e2e4')

After analyzing the position, I see I'm playing as Black and have several options. I notice my king is on g8, and I have a knight on g5 that's active. White has a rook on h3 and a bishop on h4, with the white king on b4.

I need to consider both safety and active play. The knight on g5 has several good options, including a potential fork with Ne6 that would attack both the rook on e8 and potentially create threats against the white king.

I'll make this move:

I'm playing as Black and I see that:
- My king is on g8 with the rook on e8 (potential castling opportunity)
- I have a knight on e6 that has several good options
- White has a king on b4 and a rook on h7
- Material seems roughly equal

Looking at my options, I notice I can castle kingside by moving my king from g8 to f8. This would improve my king safety and connect my rooks. Given the open position and my king's current exposure, castling seems like a good strategic choice.

The position appears to be in the middlegame with material roughly equal. Castling is a priority when it's available and safe, as it helps with king safety and rook connectivity.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

I need to analyze the position carefully before making my move.

Looking at the board, I see that:
- I'm playing as Black with my king on g8
- White has a rook on h6 and a bishop on h4, both potentially threatening me
- White's king is on b4, far from my pieces
- I have a knight on e6 that could be developed

The most pressing concern is safety. The white rook on h6 is threatening the g7 pawn, and if I'm not careful, there could be checkmate threats along the h-file.

One strong move would be to play 1...f7-f5, which:
- Defends the g7 pawn
- Opens a potential escape square for my king at f7
- Controls the e4 square
- Gives my pieces more breathing room

You are a professional chess player and you play as black. Now is your turn to make a move. Before making a move you can pick one of the following actions:
- 'get_current_board' to get the schema and current status of the board
- 'get_legal_moves' to get a UCI formatted list of available moves
- 'make_move <UCI formatted move>' when you are ready to complete your turn (e.g., 'make_move e2e4')

Player_Black (to Proxy):

After analyzing the position, I see several strong options as Black:

1. I have a rook on e4 and a knight on f4 that are both active pieces
2. My king is on h8 and can move to g8
3. I have several pawn moves available

Looking at the position, I notice my knight on f4 is well-positioned and can make several strong moves. The move f4g6 looks particularly strong as it attacks the white bishop on h4 while also potentially setting up a fork.

I'll make this move:

I'll analyze the position as Black:

I have a rook on e4, a knight on g6, a bishop on c8, and my king on h8. White has a king on b3, a knight on b8, and a bishop on h4.

Material is roughly equal, but I need to be careful about my king's safety and look for active play.

Key observations:
- My rook on e4 is very active and controls the e-file
- I could consider moving my king to g8 for safety
- The knight on g6 has several good outposts

After evaluating the options, I'll move my king to g8 for safety, removing it from the h-file and improving its position.

I notice several key elements:
- I have a rook on e4 that's very active
- My king is on g8
- I have a knight on g6 that could be developed better
- White has a bishop on h4 that could be threatening

One of the strongest moves I see is to use my rook to control more of the board. Moving the rook to the a-file would give me control of the entire 4th rank while potentially threatening White's king on b3.

2. White's king is on b2, quite far from my pieces
3. I have a rook on a4 that's active and can potentially create threats
4. My bishop on c8 is somewhat restricted
5. My knight on g6 has mobility

Looking at the legal moves, I see an opportunity to improve my rook's position by moving it to the 7th rank, which would create pressure against White's position.

I'm playing as Black, and I see that:

- I have a rook on a7
- I have a knight on g6
- I have pawns on c7, d7, f5, and g7

White has:
- King on b2
- Bishops on c8 and h4
- Knight on c6

Looking at the legal moves and the position, I need to prioritize king safety and piece coordination. The knight on g6 is attacked by the bishop on h4, so I should consider moving it. Also, my king has limited mobility.

After analyzing the position, I'll move my rook to create counterplay and potentially threaten White's king.

I need to consider my best move here. A few key observations:
- My rook on a2 is very active and can potentially deliver a check or attack White's king
- My knight on e7 is well-positioned and has several good options
- I should be careful about the bishop on h4 which is attacking my f5 pawn

The strongest move appears to be to use my rook to attack White's king:

Now I can see the board position. I'm playing as Black and I notice:
- My king is on g8
- I have a rook on b2, a knight on e6, and pawns on c7, d7, e6, g7, and f5
- White has a king on a6, bishops on c8 and h4

Let me check what legal moves I have available.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Thank you for providing the legal moves. Let me analyze the position and make a decision.

Looking at the position, I notice several key factors:
- My rook on b2 is active and controls the 2nd rank
- My knight on e6 is centralized
- White's bishops are on c8 and h4

Among my options, I see some strong possibilities:
1. Rook moves like b2h2 could attack White's bishop on h4
2. Knight moves to improve position or attack
3. Pawn advances to gain space

After evaluation, I believe attacking the bishop on h4 with my rook is the most direct and forcing move.

The most critical aspects of this position:
1. My king is relatively safe but could use more space
2. My rook on h2 is very active and can potentially attack White's king
3. White has two bishops but they're not immediately threatening

I see a strong move with my rook that can put pressure on White's position:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

I need to carefully analyze this position. As Black, I'm in a complex situation with my king on g8, a knight on e7, and a rook on a2. White has two bishops (on d7 and h7) and the white king is on b6.

Key observations:
- My king is on g8 with limited mobility
- My knight on e7 is protecting the g6 square
- My rook on a2 is active and could potentially deliver checks
- I have pawns on c7, g7, and f5

Looking at the threats:
- The bishop on d7 is checking my king
- I need to address this check immediately

Let me consider my options:
1. Move the king: g8h8, g8f8, or g8h7
2. Block the check with the knight: e7c6 or e7d5
3. Capture the checking bishop: Not possible

The most natural move is to simply move my king out of check. Moving to h8 seems safest as it gets away from the white king.

This is a straightforward decision since I need to get out of check, and moving to g8 is the most natural response.

1. Safety of my king
2. Potential threats or captures
3. Improving my position

The rook on b2 is my most active piece and can potentially create threats. Moving it to the h-file could create pressure:

I see that I can deliver checkmate with my rook by moving it to a2, which would put the white king in check with no escape squares.

I need to analyze this position carefully. I'm playing as Black and I see:

1. My king is on g8 with White bishops on e5 and d7 nearby
2. I have a knight on e7 and pawns on c7, g7, and f5
3. I have a rook on a2
4. White's king is on b4

Looking at the position, I notice my rook on a2 is free to move along the a-file or horizontally. Since White's king is on b4, I can deliver a check and potentially improve my position.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

I need to analyze this position carefully. 

I see that I'm playing as Black with my king on g8, a knight on e7, pawns on c7, g7, and f5, and a rook on b2. White has a king on c3 and two bishops on e8 and d7.

Key observations:
- My king is on g8 with limited mobility
- My rook on b2 is active and has many possible moves
- The knight on e7 is protecting my king from the bishop on d7
- I have pawns that could potentially advance

Looking at the position, I notice my rook on b2 is very active and can potentially create threats. Moving it to the back rank could put pressure on White's position.

I'll make a strong move with my rook to control the second rank:

I need to analyze this position carefully. As Black, I have several pieces: king on g8, knight on e7, pawns on c7, g7, and f5, and a rook on h2.

White has a king on c3 and two bishops on e5 and d7. My king is potentially in a dangerous position with those bishops controlling diagonals.

Looking at my options:
1. My rook on h2 is very active and could be used for a check or attack
2. My king needs to stay safe
3. My knight on e7 has several potential moves

The strongest move appears to be using my rook to check the white king:

3. I have a knight on e7, a rook on c2, and pawns on c7, g7, and f5
4. White is threatening my king with the bishop on e5

This is a critical position. I need to address the check from the bishop on e5. My options are:
- Move the king (g8h8, g8f8)
- Block with the knight (e7g6)
- Block with a pawn (g7g6)
- Capture the checking bishop (not possible)

The best move appears to be blocking with the knight, which also threatens White's bishop on d7.

- My rook on d2 is active and currently attacking White's king on c3

Looking at the position, I notice I have a rook on c2 that's very active and threatening White's position. My king is safe for now, and I have a knight on g6 that could potentially be developed better.

The most powerful piece I have is the rook on c2, which is already in a strong position. I could:
1. Attack White's king directly with Rc2-d2, putting the king in check
2. Move the rook to another strong position like c4 to control more of the board

Since White's king is exposed on d3, putting it in check with my rook seems like the strongest move.

2. My rook on d2 is very active and can potentially deliver a check or attack White's pieces.
3. White's bishop on e8 is threatening my king's position.

Looking at my options, I should use my rook effectively since it's my strongest piece. Moving it to d1 or along the d-file doesn't create immediate threats. However, moving it to the second rank could create threats against White's king on c3.

The move d2c2+ would check White's king, forcing it to move and giving me the initiative. This looks like the strongest move as it puts immediate pressure on my opponent.

You are a professional chess player and you play as black. Now is your turn to make a move. Before making a move you can pick one of the following actions:
- 'get_current_board' to get the schema and current status of the board
- 'get_legal_moves' to get a UCI formatted list of available moves
- 'make_move <UCI formatted move>' when you are ready to complete your turn (e.g., 'make_move e2e4')

I can see the current board position. I'm playing as Black, and I have a king on g8, a knight on g6, a rook on c2, and pawns on c7, g7, and f5. White has a king on b4, and two bishops on e8 and a4.

Let me check what legal moves I have available.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Now I can see all my legal moves. Let me analyze the position and make the best move:

1. I notice White has two bishops but no immediate threats to my king.
2. My rook on c2 is active and could be used to create threats.
3. My knight on g6 is well positioned.

Looking at my options, I see several strong possibilities:
- I could advance my c-pawn with c7c5 to gain space
- I could move my rook along the 2nd rank to attack White's king
- I could reposition my knight

The most immediate opportunity I see is that my rook on c2 can move to b2, directly attacking White's king on b4. This would force White to move the king, giving me the initiative.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Thank you for providing the legal moves. Let me analyze the position and make the best move.

Looking at the position:
- I have a material advantage with a rook, knight, and three pawns against White's two bishops
- My king is safe for now, but I should be careful about potential checks
- My rook on c2 is active and could be used to attack or defend
- My c7 pawn could be advanced toward promotion

After evaluating the options, I see that my rook on c2 is very active and can potentially create threats. Moving it to the 6th rank would control important squares and put pressure on White's position.

I'm playing as Black with my king on g8. I have a rook on c6, a knight on g6, and pawns on c7, g7, and f5. White has a king on b5 and two bishops on e8 and a4.

Key observations:
- My king is in the corner with limited mobility
- The white bishop on e8 is controlling the a4-e8 diagonal
- I should consider improving my piece positions or creating threats

Among my options:
- Moving my rook to create threats (c6f6 looks active)
- Advancing my f-pawn with f5f4
- Repositioning my knight from g6

I think the most active move is to place my rook on the 6th rank where it controls important squares and creates threats.

I need to make a strong move here. I notice several key factors:
1. My king is somewhat exposed
2. My rook on f6 is active and controls the f-file
3. My knight on g6 is well-positioned

Looking at my options, I'll play the rook move f6f7, which strengthens my position by:
- Protecting the g7 pawn
- Maintaining control of the f-file
- Creating a stronger defensive structure around my king
- Preparing for potential counterplay

- My king is on g8
- I have a rook on f7, a knight on g6, and pawns on c7 and f5
- White has two bishops (on e8 and a4) and the king on b6

Looking at the legal moves, I need to consider:
- King safety is a priority
- The bishop on e8 is checking my king
- I need to address this check immediately

The most direct way to address the check is to move my king or block with a piece. Since the bishop is on e8, I can move my king to h8 or f8, or block with my rook or knight.

Moving to h8 seems safest as it gets out of the diagonal. Moving to f8 would put me on the same file as White's bishop on e8.

- My king is on h8
- I have a rook on f7
- I have a knight on g6
- I have pawns on c7 and f5
- White has a king on b6 and two bishops on e8 and d7

This appears to be a difficult position. Let me consider my options:

1. King safety is a priority - I could move my king to g8 or h7
2. My rook on f7 is protecting the f5 pawn and could be developed
3. My knight on g6 has several options
4. I could advance my c7 pawn

Looking at the position, I notice White's bishops are targeting my kingside. Moving my king to g8 seems safer than h7 as it gets away from the e8 bishop's diagonal.

You are a professional chess player and you play as black. Now is your turn to make a move. Before making a move you can pick one of the following actions:
- 'get_current_board' to get the schema and current status of the board
- 'get_legal_moves' to get a UCI formatted list of available moves
- 'make_move <UCI formatted move>' when you are ready to complete your turn (e.g., 'make_move e2e4')

Now I can see the board position. I'm playing as Black, and I notice my king is on g8, with a knight on g6, a rook on f6, and pawns on c7, f7, and f5. White has a king on b6 and two bishops on e8 and e5.

Let me check what legal moves I have available.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Thank you for providing the legal moves. Let me analyze the position:

I need to consider my king's safety first. My king on g8 is not in check currently, but I should be careful about potential threats.

Looking at the legal moves:
- The knight on g6 has several options (h8, f8, e7, e5, h4, f4)
- I can advance my c-pawn (c7-c6 or c7-c5)
- I can advance my f-pawn (f5-f4)
- I can move my king (g8-h8, g8-f8, g8-h7)

The bishop on e5 is attacking my knight on g6, so I should consider moving it. Moving the knight to e7 looks good as it protects my king and gets out of the bishop's attack.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

I need to analyze this position carefully. I'm playing as Black and have several options.

Key observations:
- My king is on g8 with limited mobility
- I have a knight on e7, rook on f7, and pawns on c7, g7, and f5
- White has a king on b6, bishops on e8 and c4

Looking at my options:
- King moves (g8h8, g8f8, g8h7) - need to consider safety
- Knight moves from e7 - could develop activity
- Pawn advances - could gain space

The most pressing concern is my king's safety. Moving to h8 (g8h8) would be a solid choice to get away from the bishop on e8. The knight on e7 is also well-positioned and could potentially create threats.

I'll make my move:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

I'll analyze the position and my available moves:

The position shows I'm playing as Black with my king on h8. White has a king on b5 and two bishops (on e5 and b4). I have a knight on e7, a rook on f7, and pawns on c7, g7, and f5.

Key considerations:
1. My king's safety is paramount
2. Material count is roughly even (I have rook + knight + 3 pawns vs White's 2 bishops)
3. My knight on e7 has several good options

The strongest move appears to be moving my knight to g6, which:
- Protects my king
- Controls important central squares
- Threatens to advance my f-pawn

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Now I understand the position and my available moves. Let me analyze the situation:

I'm playing as Black with my king on h8. White has two bishops (on e8 and b5) and the white king is on b4. I have a rook on f7, a knight on g6, and pawns on c7 and f5.

Looking at my options:
- Moving my king to g8 or h7 seems reasonable for safety
- I could advance my c-pawn (c7-c5 or c7-c6)
- My knight on g6 has several options
- My rook on f7 can move along the 7th rank or to f6/f8

The most active move appears to be advancing my c-pawn to c5, which would challenge White's position and give me more space. This pawn advance looks strong as it can potentially become a passed pawn later.
