Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, I have a good selection of moves. Let's consider a few options.

*   **Developing the Queen's Bishop:** `f8e7` looks like a solid developing move, putting the bishop on a good diagonal.
*   **Pawn moves:** `h7h6`, `g7g6`, `d7d6`, `b7b6`, `a7a6` are all standard pawn moves, preparing for further development or controlling the center.
*   **Queen moves:** `d8e7` is also a developing move for the queen, though it might be a bit early.

I think developing the bishop is a good, safe move.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, I have a good number of options. Let's analyze them.

*   **Pawn moves:** `h7h6`, `g7g6`, `d7d6`, `b7b6`, `a7a6`, `h7h5`, `g7g5`, `d7d5`, `b7b5`, `a7a5` These are standard pawn moves. I'll consider these later.
*   **Knight moves:** `f6g8`, `f6h5`, `f6d5`, `f6g4`, `f6e4`, `c6b8`, `c6a5`, `c6d4`, `c6b4` The knights have some interesting possibilities. `f6g8` attacks the rook, but it's not immediately threatening. `f6h5` develops the knight and attacks the pawn. `f6d5` attacks the center. `c6b8` develops the knight.
*   **Bishop moves:** `e7f8`, `e7d6`, `e7c5`, `e7b4`, `e7a3` The bishop on e7 has a long diagonal and can be useful.
*   **Rook moves:** `h8g8`, `h8f8`, `a8b8` The rooks are currently blocked.
*   **King moves:** `e8f8`, `e8g8` The king is safe for now.
*   **Pawn push:** `e5d4`, `e5e4`

Considering the position, I want to develop my pieces and control the center. I also want to be careful not to expose my king.

I like the idea of developing the knight on f6. `f6d5` looks like a good move, attacking the center and potentially opening lines.

Therefore, I'll make the move `f6d5`.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Okay, I have a lot of options. Let's analyze.

*   **Pawn moves:** I see a lot of pawn moves available. Pushing the pawns on the kingside (h7, g7, f7) seems reasonable to control the center and prepare for a possible kingside attack later. Pushing the pawns on the queenside (a7, b7) is also an option, but less immediately impactful. Pushing d7 or e7 is also possible.
*   **Knight moves:** The knight on c6 has several options. Moving it to b8, a5, d4, or b4 are all possibilities.
*   **Bishop moves:** The bishop on f8 has a few options, but they don't seem particularly strong right now.
*   **Rook moves:** The rook on a8 can move to b8. The rook on h8 can move to g8 or f8.
*   **King moves:** The king on e8 has a few options, but they don't seem particularly strong right now.

Considering the position, I think a good developing move is to push the pawn on g7 to g6. This controls the center and prepares for a possible kingside attack later.

Alright, I've got a good list of moves to consider. Let's think...

The position is relatively open, and White has a strong central presence. My Queen is well-placed, and I need to develop my pieces and challenge White's control of the center.

I like the idea of developing my Bishop to f6, attacking the knight on g5 and potentially opening lines for my Queen.

So, I'll move my Bishop from e7 to f6.

I'll move my knight from c6 to e7. This develops the knight, supports the pawn on d5, and prepares to challenge the center.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, I have a good list of moves. Let's analyze.

*   **Pawn Moves:** I have a lot of pawn moves available. Pushing pawns can control the center and open lines for my pieces.
*   **Bishop Moves:** My dark-squared bishop on f6 has some interesting diagonals.
*   **Rook Moves:** The rook on a8 has a few options.
*   **King Moves:** The king on e8 has some options.
*   **Knight Moves:** The knight on e5 has some options.

I'm leaning towards developing my pieces and controlling the center. I think ...d6 is a solid move, supporting the e5 knight and preparing to develop my light-squared bishop.

*   **King Safety:** My king is currently safe, but I should keep an eye on potential threats.
*   **Piece Development:** I have some pieces that could be developed further.
*   **Pawn Structure:** The pawn structure is relatively closed in the center.
*   **Tactical Considerations:** I don't see any immediate tactical opportunities.

Considering the position, I think developing the queen's bishop to a more active square is a good idea. **...Bg4** looks like a solid developing move, putting pressure on the f3 square and potentially eyeing the h3 square.

*   **Pawn moves:** `d5` pawn moves are tempting to challenge the center, but I need to be careful.
*   **Bishop moves:** `g4` bishop has a few options.

I think the most active move is to develop the queen and put pressure on the center. `e7c6` looks like a good developing move that also attacks the white pawn on d5.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Okay, a lot of options. Let's break this down.

*   **King moves:** e8f8, e8d8, e8e7, e8g8, e8c8. The king needs to be protected. e8f8 looks interesting to get the king out of the d-file.
*   **Rook moves:** h8g8, h8f8, a8d8, a8c8, a8b8. The rooks are currently passive.
*   **Queen moves:** d7d8, d7c8, d7e7, d7e6, d7f5. The queen is under attack and needs to move. d7e7 looks like a good option to defend the king.
*   **Knight moves:** f6d8, f6g7, f6e7, f6g5, f6h4, c6d8, c6b8, c6e7, c6a5, c6d4, c6b4. The knights are somewhat restricted.
*   **Pawn moves:** e5d4, h7h6, b7b6, a7a6, g6g5, h7h5, b7b5, a7a5. Pawn moves are generally less impactful in this position.

Considering the threats and the need to defend, I think the best move is to move the queen to e7 to defend the king and control the d-file.

Okay, I see the board. White has a strong attack developing with the queen and bishop aiming at my king. I need to defend and develop my pieces quickly. Let's see what legal moves I have.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Okay, that's a lot of moves. White's queen is a real threat. I need to prioritize defending my king and developing my pieces.

*   **h7h6** and **h7h5** are passive moves that don't really help.
*   **e7e6** and **e7e5** look interesting, but might open up the position too much.
*   **e8d7** and **e8f8** are also possible king moves.
*   **f6g7, f6g5, f6e5, f6h4** are knight moves.
*   **d5b6, d5f4, d5b4, d5e3, d5c3** are pawn moves.
*   **a8d8, a8c8, a8b8** are rook moves.
*   **g4c8, g4d7, g4e6, g4h5, g4f5, g4h3, g4f3** are bishop moves.

I think I'll move my knight to a more active square to defend against the attack. **f6e8** is a good option.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

You are absolutely right! I made a mistake. The knight on f6 cannot move to e8. My apologies. I need to be more careful.

Let's re-evaluate. The immediate threat is the queen and bishop on the kingside. I need to develop a piece to defend.

*   **h7h6** is passive.
*   **e7e6** might be okay, but doesn't directly address the threat.
*   **e8d7** or **e8f8** are king moves, but I don't want to move my king just yet.
*   **f6g7, f6g5, f6e5, f6h4** are knight moves. **f6g5** looks like a good defensive move, attacking the bishop and potentially opening lines for my queen.

I'll try **f6g5**.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Okay, I have a lot of options. Let's analyze them.

*   **King moves:** The king has limited movement.
*   **Rook moves:** The rooks on a8 and h8 have several options.
*   **Queen moves:** The queen on d8 has many options.
*   **Knight moves:** The knight on c6 has several options.
*   **Pawn moves:** The pawns have a variety of moves.

The position looks a bit closed. White has a strong pawn structure in the center. I think I need to develop my pieces and try to create some pressure.

I see a few interesting options. Moving the queen to a more active square seems good. Also, developing the knight is a good idea. I'll start with developing the knight.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Okay, that's a lot of moves. Let's analyze. Black's queen on e7 is well-placed. White's king is somewhat exposed. I see a few interesting possibilities.

*   **Queen moves:** The queen can move to several squares, but I want to be careful not to trade it off without a good reason. Qe6 seems interesting, attacking the pawn on f5 and potentially opening lines.
*   **Pawn moves:** Pushing pawns can be useful for controlling the center and creating threats. ...h6, ...f6, ...c6, ...b6, ...a6 are all possible.
*   **Knight moves:** The knight on d4 has several options.

I think the most active move is to develop the queen and put pressure on the white position. Let's try **...Qe6**.

*   **d6e5:** This is a pawn move, but it doesn't block the check.
*   **h7h6, f7f6, c7c6, b7b6, a7a6, h7h5, f7f5, c7c5, b7b5, a7a5:** These are pawn moves. None of them block the check.

The king has to move. Moving the king to f8 looks like the best option. It gets the king out of the immediate attack and seems to be the safest square.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, I have a lot of options. The most tempting is to attack the king directly. Let's look at the queen moves. `e6e7` looks interesting, attacking the king. Let's see if that's the best option.

`e6e7` forces the king to move, and then I can bring my rook to bear. However, white might have some defensive resources. Let's consider other options.

`d5f6` attacks the knight, and opens up the diagonal for my bishop. This might be a good developing move.

`g4f3` attacks the knight, and opens up the diagonal for my bishop. This might be a good developing move.

`h8g8` is a safe move, but doesn't immediately threaten anything.

`f8g7` is a safe move, but doesn't immediately threaten anything.

After careful consideration, I think the most forcing move is to attack the king.

Okay, I have a lot of options. The most immediate threat is to the white king. I see a few possibilities to attack the king.

*   **Qg7** puts the queen on the g-file, attacking the king.
*   **Qe5** attacks the king and opens up the diagonal for the bishop.
*   **Qh4** attacks the king.

I will choose the most forcing move.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Okay, I have a lot of options. Let's analyze a bit.

*   **Pawn moves:** Pushing the pawns on the h, f, c, b, and a files are all possible, but don't immediately address the central control.
*   **Knight moves:** The knight on g5 has several options. Moving it to f6 looks interesting, challenging the center and potentially preparing to attack the white king.
*   **Rook moves:** The rook on a8 has several options, but none seem immediately impactful.
*   **Bishop moves:** The bishop on g4 has a lot of options but none seem immediately impactful.
*   **Queen moves:** The queen on d5 has a lot of options but none seem immediately impactful.

I think the most active move is to develop the knight and challenge the center.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Okay, I have a lot of options. Let's analyze them.

*   **Rook moves:** The rook moves don't seem immediately helpful. They don't develop any immediate threats or improve the king's safety.
*   **Knight moves:** The knight moves are interesting. Nf6-g7 or Nf6-e7 seem like they might be useful to defend the king.
*   **Queen moves:** The queen moves are limited, and don't seem to help much.
*   **Pawn moves:** The pawn moves are mostly defensive. h7-h6, c7-c6, b7-b6, a7-a6, g6-g5, h7-h5, c7-c5, a7-a5 are all possible.

Considering the position, I think the most important thing is to defend the king and develop a piece. The knight move to g7 seems like a good defensive move. It blocks a potential attack and could be useful later.

I'm going to go with the most forcing move.

*   **Queen moves:** g7h6, g4c8, g4d7, g4e6, g4h5, g4f5, g4h3, g4f3. The queen on g7 is a major threat. Moving the queen to h6 attacks the white king, but it can be easily defended. Moving the queen to other squares doesn't seem to improve the position significantly.
*   **Pawn moves:** c7d6, f7f6, c7c6, b7b6, a7a6, g6g5, f7f5, c7c5, a7a5. Pushing pawns doesn't seem to be the best option right now.
*   **Rook moves:** h8g8, f8g8, f8e8, a8e8, a8d8, a8c8, a8b8. Moving the rooks doesn't seem to be the most pressing issue.
*   **King moves:** f8e8. The king is safe for now.

The most pressing issue is the threat of the white queen on d4. I need to find a way to defend against it. Moving the queen to h6 seems like the best option. It attacks the white king and forces a response.

Okay, I have a lot of options. White's queen on g1 is a threat, but my queen on h3 is also a threat. I need to be careful. Let's analyze some of these moves:

*   **h8g8, f8g8, f8e8, a8e8, a8d8, a8c8, a8b8:** These are rook moves. Moving the rook doesn't immediately address the threat of white's queen.
*   **h6g7, h6h5, h6g5, h6h4, h6f4, h6h3, h6e3, h6d2, h6c1:** These are pawn moves. Moving the pawn to h3 is not a good move because it will be captured by the white queen.
*   **g4c8, g4d7, g4e6, g4h5, g4f5, g4h3, g4f3:** These are queen moves. The queen on h3 is already attacking the white king.
*   **c7d6, f7f6, c7c6, b7b6, a7a6, g6g5, f7f5, c7c5, a7a5:** These are pawn moves.

The most pressing issue is the threat to my king. I need to move my queen to safety.

Let's consider the queen moves. Qg4f3 seems like a good move. It attacks the white king and gets the queen out of the line of fire.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, I've got the legal moves. White is clearly trying to attack the king. Let's evaluate the options.

*   **Queen moves:** The queen moves are interesting. Moving the queen to g7 seems like a good defensive move, protecting the king and potentially opening up a line for the rook on h8.

*   **Pawn moves:** Pawn moves are mostly defensive, but some could open up lines for the queen.

I think the most important thing is to defend the king. Moving the queen to g7 seems like the best option.

Alright, I've got the legal moves. The most pressing issue is the threat to my king. White's queen and rook on the h-file are a serious threat. I need to find a move that addresses this immediately.

Let's consider the options:

*   **h8g8, h8h7:** Moving the rook doesn't seem to directly address the immediate threat.
*   **f8g8, f8e8:** Moving the queen doesn't help much.
*   **a8e8, a8d8, a8c8, a8b8:** Moving the rook doesn't help much.
*   **g7g8:** Promoting the pawn to a queen is not helpful.
*   **g7h7, g7f6, g7e5, g7d4:** These pawn moves don't address the immediate danger.
*   **f3d5, f3g4, f3e4, f3g2, f3e2, f3d1:** These knight moves are for white.
*   **c7d6, f7f6, c7c6, b7b6, a7a6, h6h5, g6g5, f7f5, c7c5:** These pawn moves don't address the immediate danger.

The best move seems to be to move the pawn in front of the king to try and block the attack.

*   **g7h6:** Moving the pawn doesn't help much.

*   **c7d6, h5g4, f7f6, c7c6, b7b6, a7a6, g6g5, h5h4, f7f5, c7c5:** These pawn moves are mostly developing moves, but some of them might be more important than others.

I think the most important thing is to defend against the immediate threats. The Queen on g7 is a big problem. I need to move my Queen to a safe square. I can move the Queen to e8 to defend the King.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, I've got a lot of options. White's attack is a real threat, so I need to prioritize defense and development.

*   **Defensive Considerations:** The immediate threats are the queen and the bishop on the kingside. I need to address those.
*   **Development:** I need to get my rooks and other pieces into the game.

Let's analyze some of the moves:

*   **h8h7, h8h6:** These rook moves don't seem to help much immediately.
*   **g7g8, g7f8:** These pawn moves are not helpful
*   **f7f6, f7f5:** These pawn moves are not helpful
*   **c7c6, c7c5:** These pawn moves are not helpful
*   **a7a6, b7b6:** These pawn moves are not helpful
*   **d7d6, d7d5:** These pawn moves are not helpful
*   **h5h4:** This pawn move is not helpful
*   **f3d5, f3g4, f3e4, f3g2, f3e2, f3d1:** These knight moves don't seem to help much immediately.

Considering the threats and the need for development, the best move seems to be to develop the queen to a safe square and prepare for counterplay.

I'll move the queen to d7, which defends the king and opens a line for the rook.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Okay, I have a lot of options. Let's analyze.

*   **Defensive moves:** I need to prioritize defending the king.
    *   `h8g8, h8f8, h8e8, h8d8, h8c8, h8b8`: Moving the rook on h8 doesn't seem to immediately help.
    *   `g7g8, g7f8`: Moving the pawn on g7 to promote it is not possible.
    *   `d7e8, d7d8, d7c8`: Moving the pawn on d7 to promote it is not possible.
    *   `h8h7, h8h6`: Moving the rook to h7 or h6 doesn't seem to help defend the king.
    *   `g7h7, g7h6, g7f6, g7e5, g7d4`: Moving the pawn on g7 doesn't seem to help.
    *   `d7d6`: This seems like a reasonable defensive move, blocking the potential check from the white queen.
    *   `c7d6, c7b6, a7b6, f7f6, c7c6, a7a6, h5h4, f7f5, c7c5`: These pawn moves don't seem to immediately address the threat.

*   **Other considerations:**
    *   White's queen is a major threat.
    *   The knight on f3 could become a problem.

Considering the immediate threat to the king, the best move seems to be to defend with the pawn on d7.

Okay, I see the board. It's a complex position. Black's king is exposed, and white has a strong attack brewing. I need to find a move that addresses the immediate threats and improves my position. Let's get a list of legal moves.

Proxy (to Player_Black):

h8g8,h8f8,h8e8,h8d8,h8c8,h8b8,h8h7,h8h6,a8g8,a8f8,a8e8,a8d8,a8c8,a8b8,g7g8,g7f8,g7h7,g7h6,g7f6,g7e5,g7d4,d6e7,d6d7,d6e5,d6d5,d6c5,f3d5,f3g4,f3e4,f3g2,f3e2,f3d1,c7b6,a7b6,f7f6,c7c6,a7a6,h5h4,f7f5,c7c5

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, that's a lot of moves. Let's analyze them.

*   **Rook moves (h8):** Moving the rook doesn't seem to immediately help.
*   **Rook moves (a8):** Similar to the h8 rook.
*   **Pawn moves (g7):** g7-g8=Q is interesting, but it's immediately captured. g7-h6/f6/e5/d4 are not helpful.
*   **Pawn moves (d6):** d6-e7/d7 are passive. d6-e5/d5/c5 are more active, but still don't address the immediate threats.
*   **Knight moves (f3):** This is a white knight.
*   **Pawn moves (c7):** c7-b6/a6/c6/c5 are all possible pawn moves.
*   **Pawn moves (a7):** a7-b6/a6 are possible pawn moves.
*   **Pawn moves (f7):** f7-f6/f5 are possible pawn moves.
*   **Pawn moves (h5):** h5-h4 is possible pawn move.

The most pressing issue is the threat to the king. The white queen on g2 is a major threat. I need to find a move that either blocks the queen's attack or creates counterplay.

The move **g7-g6** looks like the best move. It blocks the queen's attack and opens a line for the black queen.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, I have a good list of moves. Let's consider the options.

*   **Pawn moves:** Pushing pawns is often a good starting point. `h7h6`, `g7g6`, `f7f6`, etc. are all possible, but don't immediately develop any pieces or challenge the center. `e5e4` is interesting, but it's not a legal move.
*   **Knight moves:** `g8e7`, `g8h6`, `g8f6`, `b8c6`, `b8a6` are all knight moves. `g8f6` develops the knight to a good square, controlling central squares. `b8c6` is also a good developing move.
*   **Bishop moves:** `f8e7`, `f8d6`, `f8c5`, `f8b4`, `f8a3` are all bishop moves. `f8e7` develops the bishop, but it's a bit passive. `f8c5` attacks the f2 pawn and controls a key diagonal.
*   **Queen moves:** `d8e7`, `d8f6`, `d8g5`, `d8h4` are all queen moves. These moves are a bit early in the game.
*   **King moves:** `e8e7` is a king move. This is not a good move.

Considering the options, I think developing the knight to f6 is a solid developing move that controls important squares.

*   **...Nf6-d5** looks interesting, challenging the center.
*   **...e7** is a standard developing move.

I think I'll go with **...Nf6-d5**. It immediately challenges the center and forces White to react.

Alright, I have a good list of moves. Let's analyze a bit. Black has a few options here. I see a few pawn moves that are safe and develop the position. I also see some bishop moves that could be interesting.

I think I'll start by developing my queen's bishop. Moving it to d6 looks like a good developing move, controlling some important squares.

Okay, I have a lot of options. I'm going to focus on developing my pieces and controlling the center.

*   **...d6f6** looks interesting, developing the Queen and attacking the knight.
*   **...d6e7** is also a solid developing move.
*   **...e8e7** is a good developing move for the king.
*   **...h7h6** is a good move to protect the king.
*   **...g7g6** is a good move to protect the king.
*   **...f7f6** is a good move to protect the king.
*   **...b7b6** is a good move to protect the king.
*   **...a7a6** is a good move to protect the king.
*   **...h7h5** is a good move to protect the king.
*   **...g7g5** is a good move to protect the king.
*   **...f7f5** is a good move to protect the king.
*   **...b7b5** is a good move to protect the king.
*   **...a7a5** is a good move to protect the king.

I think I'll develop my Queen to a good square and attack the knight.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, that's a lot of moves. White's queen and bishops are targeting my king. I need to be careful. Let's analyze the options:

*   **King moves:** `h8g8, h8f8, e8f8, e8d8, e8e7, e8g8`. Moving the king doesn't seem to solve the problem immediately. `e8e7` looks like the best option here, as it gets the king out of the direct line of fire from the white queen and bishop.
*   **Rook moves:** `a8b8`. This doesn't seem to help much.
*   **Knight moves:** `f6d8, f6e7, f6h6, f6g6, f6e6, f6g5, f6f5, f6h4, f6f4, f6f3, d6f8, d6e7, d6c5, d6b4, d6a3, c6d8, c6b8, c6e7, c6a5, c6d4, c6b4`. The knight moves are numerous, but many of them don't seem to help the immediate situation. `f6e7` seems like a reasonable developing move, supporting the king.
*   **Pawn moves:** `h7h6, g7g6, b7b6, a7a6, e5e4, h7h5, g7g5, b7b5, a7a5`. Pawn moves don't seem to be the priority right now.

Considering the immediate threats, I think the best move is to move the king to e7. This gets the king out of the direct line of fire and prepares for further defense.

*   **Defense:** I need to defend against White's attack.

Considering these factors, I think the best move is to develop the knight and challenge White's control of the center.

Okay, I have a lot of options. White's queen is a major threat. I need to consider the following:

*   **King Safety:** My king is somewhat exposed. I need to be careful about immediate attacks.
*   **Development:** I need to develop my pieces to counterattack.
*   **Threats:** White has a strong attack. I need to address the immediate threats.

Let's analyze some of the moves:

*   **...h7h6:** This seems like a reasonable move to protect the h-file and prevent a potential rook lift.
*   **...e7e6:** This blocks the diagonal of the white bishop on f1, which is a good idea.
*   **...f7f6:** This also helps to protect the king.
*   **...d6c5:** This attacks the white pawn on c5, which could be good.

I'll choose a move that improves my king's safety while developing a pawn. I will play **h7h6**.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Okay, I've got a lot of options. White is clearly trying to attack. Let's analyze the most pressing threats and potential responses.

*   **King Safety:** My king is vulnerable. I need to consider moves that improve its safety.
*   **Development:** I need to develop my pieces to counterattack.
*   **Immediate Threats:** White's queen and bishop are targeting my kingside.

Considering these factors, here's my thought process:

*   **h8g8, h8f8, h8e8, h8d8, h8h7, a8b8, e7f8, e7e8, e7d8:** These moves with the rook and king don't seem to address the immediate threats or develop my pieces effectively.
*   **e7f6, e7e6:** Moving the pawn in front of the king seems like a reasonable defensive move.
*   **d6c5, d6b4, d6a3, c6d8, c6b8, c6a5, c6d4, c6b4:** These knight moves are interesting, but might not be the most urgent.
*   **d5f6, d5b6, d5f4, d5b4, d5e3, d5c3:** These knight moves are interesting, but might not be the most urgent.
*   **h4f6, h4h5, h4g5, h4g4, h4h3, h4g3, h4h2, h4f2, h4e1:** These knight moves are interesting, but might not be the most urgent.
*   **e5f4:** This pawn move doesn't seem to help.
*   **g7g6, f7f6, b7b6, a7a6, h6h5:** These pawn moves are defensive and help to control the center.
*   **e5e4:** This pawn move doesn't seem to help.
*   **g7g5, f7f5, b7b5, a7a5:** These pawn moves are defensive and help to control the center.

I think the most important thing is to try to defend the king and develop a piece. Moving the pawn in front of the king seems like a good idea.

I'll move the pawn to e6.

Okay, I've got a lot of options. Let's analyze this a bit. White has a strong attack brewing, and my king is a little exposed. I need to be careful.

*   **Defensive Moves:** Moves like `h8h7` or `h8g8` with the rook are tempting to develop the rook, but they don't immediately address the threats.
*   **Pawn Moves:** `g7g6` and `f7f6` are solid pawn moves, but they don't actively improve my position.
*   **Knight Moves:** The knight on d6 has some interesting options. `d6f8` could be a good developing move, but it might not be the most urgent.
*   **Bishop Moves:** The bishop on c6 has several options.
*   **King Moves:** The king on e5 has some options, but I don't want to move the king now.

I think the most important thing is to develop a piece and try to control the center. I like the idea of developing the knight to f8. It defends the g6 square and prepares to potentially jump to h7 or g6.

Okay, I have a lot of options. White's queen is a threat, and I need to address that. Moving the pawn on f7 to f6 seems like a good defensive move, blocking the diagonal of the white queen. It also prepares for a possible ...g5 advance later.

*   **King safety:** My king is a little vulnerable. I need to consider moves that improve its safety.
*   **Queen threat:** White's queen on g7 is a threat.
*   **Development:** I need to develop my pieces and control the center.

Considering all of this, I think the best move is to develop my knight and attack the queen.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Okay, that's a lot of moves. Let's analyze them.

*   **King moves:** No safe King moves are available.
*   **Rook moves:** a8b8 is a possibility, but doesn't immediately help.
*   **Bishop moves:** f8h8, f8g8, f8e8, f8d8, f8f7 are all options. Moving the Bishop on f8 seems like a good idea to develop it.
*   **Pawn moves:** g7g6 seems like a good defensive move to protect the King. d7d6 is also a good option to support the pawn structure.
*   **Knight moves:** d4c6, d4f5, d4b5, d4f3, d4b3, d4e2, d4c2 are all options.
*   **Other moves:** c5e7, c5d6, c5b6, c5b4, c5a3, h4h5, h4g5, h4g4, h4h3, h4g3, h4h2, h4f2, h4e1, c7b6, a7b6, e5f4, g7g6, d7d6, c7c6, a7a6, h6h5, f6f5, e5e4, g7g5, a7a5

I think the most pressing issue is the attack on my King. I need to develop a piece to help defend. Moving the Bishop on f8 to g7 seems like a good developing move that also helps defend against the Queen's attack.

You are a professional chess player and you play as black. Now is your turn to make a move. Before making a move you can pick one of the following actions:
- 'get_current_board' to get the schema and current status of the board
- 'get_legal_moves' to get a UCI formatted list of available moves
- 'make_move <UCI formatted move>' when you are ready to complete your turn (e.g., 'make_move e2e4')

Okay, I have the list of legal moves. Let's analyze the position. Black has a few options. I'll start by looking at developing my pieces.

*   **...Nf6:** This is a standard developing move, controlling central squares and preparing for further development.
*   **...Be7:** This develops the bishop, but it might be slightly passive.
*   **...Qe7:** This develops the queen, but it might be a bit early and could be a target.
*   **...h6, g6, f6, etc.:** These are pawn moves that don't immediately develop pieces, but can be useful for controlling space or preparing for a kingside attack.
*   **...a6, b6, d6, etc.:** These are pawn moves that don't immediately develop pieces, but can be useful for controlling space or preparing for a queenside attack.
*   **...h5, g5, f5, etc.:** These are pawn moves that don't immediately develop pieces, but can be useful for controlling space or preparing for an attack.

Considering the position, I think developing the knight to f6 is a solid and flexible move. It controls important central squares and prepares for further development.

Alright, I've got a good list of possible moves. Let's think this through.

*   **King moves:** e8e7 is a possibility, but it doesn't seem to improve the position much.
*   **Queen moves:** d8e7 is a possibility, but it doesn't seem to improve the position much.
*   **Rook moves:** h8h7, h8h6, a8b8 are possibilities, but they don't seem to improve the position much.
*   **Bishop moves:** f8e7, f8d6, f8c5, f8b4, f8a3 are possibilities, but they don't seem to improve the position much.
*   **Knight moves:** f6g8, f6h7, f6h5, f6d5, f6g4, f6e4, c6b8, c6e7, c6a5, c6d4, c6b4 are possibilities, but they don't seem to improve the position much.
*   **Pawn moves:** g7h6, e5d4, g7g6, d7d6, b7b6, a7a6, e5e4, g7g5, d7d5, b7b5, a7a5 are possibilities.

I see a few pawn moves that could be useful. I think I'll play **g7g6**. This supports the knight on f6 and prepares to challenge the center.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, I've got a lot of options. Let's think this through. White's queen is a threat, and I need to develop my pieces and control the center.

*   **Developing the Bishop:** Moving the bishop on f8 is a good idea. f8e7 looks like a solid developing move.
*   **Pawn Structure:** I could push pawns, but it's too early to commit to a specific pawn structure.
*   **Knight Development:** The knight on f6 has a few options, but none immediately jump out as critical.

Considering all of this, I think developing the bishop to e7 is the best move. It develops a piece, prepares for castling, and doesn't overextend.

*   **Pawn moves:** `d7d6` or `d7d5` are also options to control the center.
*   **Knight moves:** `f6h7`, `f6h5`, `f6d5`, `f6g4`, `f6e4` are possible, but some of these look a bit passive.

I think developing the Bishop is a good start. I'll play `h8g8`.

Okay, I see the board. White has a strong center and a queen actively placed. Black's pieces are a bit cramped. I need to develop my pieces and challenge White's control of the center. Let's see what moves are available.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Okay, I have a lot of options. Let's analyze a few of the more interesting ones:

*   **...g8g7**: This develops the rook, but it's a passive move.
*   **...f6h5**: This attacks the knight, but it doesn't achieve much.
*   **...f6d5**: This challenges the center and opens lines for my pieces. This looks promising.
*   **...d6e7**: This develops the queen, but it might be a bit exposed.
*   **...b7b6**: This supports the pawn structure.
*   **...a7a6**: This supports the pawn structure.
*   **...b7b5**: This challenges the center.

I think **...f6d5** is the most active and promising move. It challenges White's control of the center, opens lines for my pieces, and forces White to react.

Okay, I have a lot of options. Let's consider a few.

*   **...d8f6:** This develops the queen and attacks the knight on f3. It also opens the diagonal for the bishop on c8. This looks like a good developing move.
*   **...g6f5:** This challenges white's control of the center and prepares to develop the knight.
*   **...e8e7:** This prepares to develop the king.

I think ...Qf6 is the most active move, developing a piece and immediately posing a threat.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, I have a lot of options. Let's analyze the position. White seems to have a slight initiative, but the position is relatively open. My queen on d6 is well-placed, and I need to develop my pieces and control the center.

I see a few interesting possibilities. Moving the queen to e7 seems solid, developing the queen and controlling the e-file. Moving the knight on f6 is also an option, but I need to be careful not to weaken my kingside too much. Pushing the b-pawn to b5 or b6 could challenge white's control of the center.

Considering all the options, I think the most active and developing move is to move the knight on f6 to e7. This develops the knight, supports the queen, and prepares to challenge white's control of the center.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Okay, I've got the legal moves. Let's analyze them.

*   **King moves:** `g8h8, g8f8, e8d8` - Moving the king doesn't seem immediately necessary, and could potentially weaken the position further.
*   **Rook moves:** `a8b8` - Doesn't seem to help much.
*   **Queen moves:** `e7f8, e7d8, e7f6, e7e6, e7g5, e7h4` - The queen is under attack, so I need to move it. `e7f6` looks interesting, developing the queen and potentially putting pressure on f2.
*   **Bishop moves:** `d6c5, d6b4, d6a3` - The bishop on d6 has some options, but none seem particularly strong right now.
*   **Knight moves:** `c6d8, c6b8, c6a5, c6d4, c6b4` - The knight on c6 has a few options. `c6d4` could be interesting, attacking the pawn on e2.
*   **Pawn moves:** `e5d4, f7f6, b7b6, a7a6, g6g5, e5e4, f7f5, b7b5, a7a5` - Pawn moves are generally less impactful in this position.

Considering the threats and development, I think the best move is to develop the queen to f6, defending the pawn on f7 and preparing to put pressure on white's position.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, I have a lot of options. Let's analyze them.

*   **Pawn moves:** `b7b6`, `a7a6`, `g6g5`, `b7b5`, `a7a5`, `e5e4` look like standard pawn moves, aiming to control the center or develop the pawn structure. `e5d4` is a capture, which needs further evaluation.
*   **Knight moves:** `f6h8`, `f6d8`, `f6g7`, `f6e7`, `f6e6`, `f6g5`, `f6f5`, `f6h4`, `f6f4`, `f6f3`, `f6f2`, `c6d8`, `c6b8`, `c6e7`, `c6a5`, `c6d4`, `c6b4` are all knight moves. Some of these look promising to develop the knights.
*   **Bishop moves:** `g8h8`, `g8f8`, `g8g7`, `d6f8`, `d6e7`, `d6c5`, `d6b4`, `d6a3` are bishop moves.
*   **Queen moves:** `e8d8`, `e8e7` are queen moves.
*   **Rook moves:** `a8b8` is a rook move.

The position is complex. I need to consider development, control of the center, and potential threats.

I'll start by developing a knight to a good square. `Nf6-e4` looks interesting, attacking the pawn on f2 and controlling a central square.

Okay, I've got the legal moves. The queen is under attack, so I need to move it.

*   **e7f6** moves the queen to a safe square, developing it to a more active position.

I'll choose e7f6 to develop the queen to a more active position.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, I have the legal moves. White's threats are serious. Let's analyze the options:

*   **King moves (e8d8, e8e7):** These don't seem to improve the position significantly and might even worsen it.
*   **Rook moves (a8b8, g8h8, g8f8, g8g7):** These don't seem to help defend the King or develop pieces effectively.
*   **Bishop moves (f6d8, f6g7, f6e7, f6h6, f6g6, f6e6, f6f5, f6f4, f6f3):** The Bishop on f6 is a key defender. Moving it away doesn't seem wise.
*   **Pawn moves:**
    *   **c7c6, b7b6, a7a6, c7c5, b7b5, a7a5:** These pawn moves don't seem to address the immediate threats.
    *   **e5e4:** This pawn move opens the position and could be dangerous.
    *   **d4 moves:** These moves look interesting.

Considering the position, I think the best move is to develop the Bishop and attack the white Queen.

Alright, I've got a lot of options. Let's break this down.

*   **Queen Defense:** The Queen on f6 is under attack. I need to address this immediately. Moving the Queen to g7 (f6g7) seems like a good defensive move, getting it out of the immediate line of fire.

*   **Pawn Structure:** I have several pawn moves available. Pushing the pawns on the a, b, c, and d files could help control the center and create space.

*   **Bishop Development:** The Bishop on c5 has a few options.

Considering the immediate threat to the Queen, I'll prioritize that.

Therefore, I will move the queen to f8.

Alright, I've got a lot of options. Let's analyze the possibilities:

*   **Defensive moves against the Queen:** Moving the King (g8h8) is an option, but it doesn't develop anything and leaves the king exposed.
*   **Developing moves:** c8d7 develops the bishop, but doesn't immediately address the threat.
*   **Pawn moves:** Pushing pawns like f7f6 or g7g6 are possible, but they don't seem to improve my position significantly.
*   **Bishop moves:** c5b4 attacks the white knight, but it doesn't seem like the best use of the bishop.
*   **Queen moves:** The Queen on d4 is a serious threat. I need to address it.

Considering the position, I think the best move is to develop my bishop and attack the white queen.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Okay, I have a list of legal moves. White's Queen on d4 is a major threat. Let's analyze the options:

*   **Pawn moves (f7f6, c7c6, b7b6, a7a6, f7f5, c7c5, b7b5, a7a5):** These are mostly passive and don't address the immediate threats. Some of them might be useful later, but not now.
*   **Bishop moves (c8d7):** This develops the Bishop and potentially prepares to defend the King.
*   **Queen moves (d6e7, d6e5, d6c5, d6b4, d6a3):** These moves try to develop the Queen and attack.
*   **Rook moves (g8h8, a8b8):** These are passive and don't help much.
*   **King moves (g7h8, g7h7, g7g6, g7f6, g7e5):** These moves try to move the King to safety.

Considering the threats, I think the best move is to develop the Queen and challenge White's control of the center. I will move the Queen to e7 to protect the King and prepare for counterplay.

Alright, I have a list of legal moves. White's queen is a major threat, and the immediate danger is the attack on the king. I need to find a move that defends the king and ideally develops a piece.

*   **g8h8:** Moving the rook doesn't seem to help much.
*   **c8d7, c8e6, c8f5, c8g4:** Moving the bishop doesn't seem to address the immediate threat.
*   **a8b8:** Moving the rook doesn't seem to help.
*   **g7h8, g7h7, g7h6, g7g6, g7f6, g7e5:** Moving the pawn doesn't seem to help.
*   **e7d8, e7f6, e7d6, e7c5, e7b4, e7a3:** Moving the queen is important. I think the best move is to move the queen to defend the king.
*   **d4e6, d4c6, d4f5, d4b5, d4f3, d4b3, d4e2, d4c2:** Moving the knight doesn't seem to help.
*   **f7f6, c7c6, b7b6, a7a6, f7f5, c7c5, a7a5:** Moving the pawns doesn't seem to help.

The most promising move seems to be moving the queen to defend the king. **e7d6** looks like a good move. It defends the king and develops the queen.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, I've got a lot of options. The immediate threats are the White Queen and Bishop targeting my King. I need to address this.

*   **Defensive Considerations:** I need to consider moves that directly defend the King or develop pieces to help in the defense.
*   **Development:** Developing my pieces is crucial.
*   **Tactical Awareness:** I need to be aware of any immediate tactical threats or opportunities.

Looking at the moves, I see a few that seem promising:

*   **...g7g6:** This move seems to help defend the King and potentially open a line for the Rook.
*   **...f6g7:** This move develops the Bishop and potentially helps defend the King.
*   **...f6e7:** This move develops the Bishop and potentially helps defend the King.
*   **...c7c6:** This move seems to be a solid developing move.
*   **...b7b6:** This move seems to be a solid developing move.
*   **...a7a6:** This move seems to be a solid developing move.

I'm leaning towards developing the Bishop to help defend the King. I'll choose ...f6g7.

*   **Developing moves:** I also want to develop my pieces to improve my position.
*   **Pawn Structure:** I need to be careful about weakening my pawn structure.

Considering the board and the list of legal moves, I think the best move is to develop my bishop and block the queen's attack.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Okay, that's a lot of moves. Let's analyze them.

*   **King moves:** g8h8, g8f8, g8e8, g8d8, g8c8, g8b8. Moving the king is generally not a good idea in the opening or middlegame unless absolutely necessary. In this position, it doesn't seem like a good option as it doesn't improve the position.
*   **Rook moves:** a8f8, a8e8, a8d8, a8c8, a8b8. Moving the rook doesn't seem to help much in this position.
*   **Pawn moves:** g7h8, g7h7, g7h6, g7g6, b7b6, a7a6, b7b5, a7a5. Pushing the g-pawn to g6 seems like a reasonable move to protect the king.
*   **Knight moves:** f6d8, f6e7, f6h6, f6g6, f6e6, f6f5, f6e5, f6f4, f6f3, f6f2, d6f8, d6e7, d6e5, d6c5, d6f4, d6b4, d6g3, d6a3, d6h2. The knight moves are a bit too many to analyze.
*   **Bishop moves:** c6d7, c6d5, c6b5, c6a4. The bishop moves don't seem to be very effective.
*   **Queen moves:** d4e6, d4f5, d4b5, d4f3, d4b3, d4e2, d4c2. The queen moves are a bit too many to analyze.

I think the most sensible move is to protect the king with g7-g6. It also opens a diagonal for the bishop.

Okay, I have a lot of options. Let's analyze them.

*   **Rook moves (g8h8, g8f8, etc.):** Moving the rook doesn't immediately address the threats and doesn't develop a piece to a useful square.
*   **Rook moves (a8f8, a8e8, etc.):** Same as above.
*   **Pawn moves (g6h7, g6g7, g6h6):** Pushing the g-pawn doesn't help much.
*   **Knight moves (f6h8, f6d8, f6g7, f6e7, f6e6, f6f5, f6e5, f6f4, f6f3, f6f2):** The knight on f6 is key to defending the king. Moving it away is dangerous.
*   **Bishop moves (d6f8, d6e7, d6e5, d6c5, d6f4, d6b4, d6g3, d6a3, d6h2):** The bishop on d6 is also important. Moving it to f8 or e7 doesn't seem to help. e5 and c5 look interesting, but might be too passive.
*   **Pawn moves (c6d7, c6d5, c6b5, c6a4):** These pawn moves don't seem to help the immediate situation.
*   **Knight moves (d4e6, d4f5, d4b5, d4f3, d4b3, d4e2, d4c2):** The knight on d4 is a threat.
*   **Pawn moves (b7b6, a7a6, b7b5, a7a5):** These pawn moves are slow and don't address the immediate threats.

The most pressing threat is the white knight on d4. I need to find a way to challenge it. The move **d4f3** looks like a good option.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Okay, that's a lot of moves. Let's analyze them.

*   **Rook moves:** Moving the rook on a8 doesn't seem to help much at the moment. Moving the rook on g8 is also not immediately helpful.
*   **Knight moves:** The knight on f6 has a lot of options. Nf6-h8 is interesting, but doesn't immediately solve any problems. Nf6-d8 is also not very useful. Nf6-g7 looks passive. Nf6-e7 looks like a good developing move. Nf6-e5 attacks the bishop and opens a line for the queen. Nf6-f5 attacks the bishop. Nf6-e6 is also a good developing move. Nf6-f4 attacks the bishop. Nf6-d4 attacks the bishop. Nf6-c3 is a bad move.
*   **Bishop moves:** The bishop on c6 has a lot of options. Bc6-d7, Bc6-d5, Bc6-b5, Bc6-a4 are all passive.
*   **Queen moves:** The queen on d6 has a lot of options. Qd6-f8, Qd6-e7, Qd6-e5, Qd6-c5, Qd6-f4, Qd6-b4, Qd6-g3, Qd6-a3, Qd6-h2 are all interesting.
*   **Pawn moves:** The pawn moves are mostly defensive.
*   **Other knight moves:** The knight on f3 has a lot of options. Nf3-e5, Nf3-h4, Nf3-d4, Nf3-h2, Nf3-d2, Nf3-g1, Nf3-e1 are all interesting.

The most pressing issue is the attack on my king. White's queen and bishops are well-positioned. I need to develop my pieces and create some counterplay.

I think the best move here is to develop my knight to e7. This blocks the diagonal of the white bishop on f1, and prepares to move the knight to f5 to attack the bishop on e2.

So, my move is Nf6-e7.

*   **Knight moves:** The knight moves are interesting. ...Nf8 seems to be a defensive move.

*   **King moves:** The king is somewhat exposed, but there are no immediate threats to the king.

Considering the position, I think the best move is to develop the knight to a defensive position.

Okay, I see the board. White has a strong attack developing, especially with the queen and the bishop on g7. My king is a bit exposed. I need to defend and develop my pieces quickly. Let's see what moves are available.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Okay, I have a lot of options. Let's analyze them:

*   **King moves:** The king moves are not good, as the king is exposed.
*   **Rook moves:** Moving the rook on a8 doesn't seem to help much.
*   **Queen moves:** The queen can move to a few squares, but it's not clear where the queen should go.
*   **Bishop moves:** The bishop on c6 has a few options, but none of them seem to immediately address the threat.
*   **Knight moves:** The knight on f3 has a few options, but none of them seem to immediately address the threat.
*   **Pawn moves:** The pawn moves are important for defense. f6-f5 seems like a good move to challenge white's control of the center. b7-b6 is also a good move to support the pawn on a7.

I think the most important thing is to defend the center and develop my pieces. f6-f5 seems like a good move to challenge white's control of the center.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, that's a lot to consider. White's queen is a major threat. I need to address that immediately.

*   **f8f7** looks like a good defensive move, protecting the king and potentially opening a line for the rook.
*   **f5f4** could be interesting, attacking the pawn on g3.
*   **d6e5** is a possibility, but it might weaken my pawn structure.
*   **b7b6** is a solid move, supporting the pawn structure.

I think the most pressing issue is the queen's threat. I'll move the rook to f7 to defend.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Okay, that's a lot of moves. The immediate threat is the rook on h1. I need to address that. Let's analyze some of the key moves:

*   **g7h8, g7g8, g7f8:** These are all rook moves, but they don't immediately help with the threat.
*   **f7f8:** Queen promotion. This is interesting, but doesn't solve the immediate problem.
*   **e7e8:** Also a queen promotion.
*   **e7e6, e7e5, e7e4, e7e3, e7e2:** These pawn moves don't seem to help.
*   **d6e5, d6c5, d6f4, d6b4, d6g3, d6a3, d6h2:** Knight moves. Some of these might be useful for defense or counterplay.
*   **c6e8, c6d7, c6d5, c6b5, c6a4:** Bishop moves.
*   **f5f4:** Pawn move.
*   **b7b6, a7a6, b7b5:** Pawn moves.

The most pressing issue is the rook on h1. I need to find a way to defend my king. The knight on d6 looks like it could be useful. Let's try moving the knight to f4. This attacks the white pawn on g2 and potentially defends against a further attack.

Okay, I have the list of legal moves. The position is quite open. White has a strong pawn center. My queen is somewhat exposed. I need to develop my pieces and challenge White's control of the center.

I see a few options:

*   **...Qe6:** This develops the queen to a more active square and attacks the e5 pawn. It also prepares for possible attacks on the kingside.
*   **...b5:** This challenges White's control of the center and opens the b-file.
*   **...a6:** This prepares to develop the rook on a8 and can also support a future ...b5 push.

I think ...Qe6 is a good developing move that puts pressure on White.

Alright, I have a lot of options. Let's analyze the position. White seems to have a strong attack, especially with the queen and bishop on the open file. Black's king is somewhat exposed. I need to develop my pieces and try to create some counterplay.

I see a few candidate moves:

*   **...h7h6**: This prevents a potential back-rank mate and prepares to develop the rook.
*   **...g7g6**: This also helps to protect the king and potentially opens a diagonal for the bishop.
*   **...f7f6**: This supports the e6 pawn and restricts white's queen.
*   **...e6e5**: This challenges white's control of the center and opens the diagonal for the bishop.
*   **...c6d5**: This challenges white's control of the center and opens the diagonal for the bishop.

Considering the position, I think the most active move is to challenge white's control of the center.

I'll choose to play **...e6e5**. This opens the diagonal for my bishop, challenges white's center, and potentially creates some tactical possibilities.

Okay, I see the board. White has a strong attack developing, and my king is exposed. I need to find a move that addresses the immediate threats and tries to develop my pieces. Let's see what my legal moves are.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, that's a lot of moves to consider. White's queen on d4 is a major threat. I need to find a move that either defends against it or develops a counter-attack.

*   **h8h7, h8h6, h8h5, h8h4, h8h3, h8h2:** Moving the rook doesn't seem to help much against the immediate threats.
*   **g7g8, g7f8, g7h7, g7h6, g7g6, g7f6:** Pawn moves don't address the queen.
*   **f7f8, f7e7, f7d7, f7f6:** Pawn moves don't address the queen.
*   **c6e8, c6d7, c6d5, c6b5, c6e4, c6a4:** The knight moves are interesting. Nc6-e4 attacks the queen, but it also opens up a potential attack on my king. Nc6-d5 seems like it could be a good developing move.
*   **e5e8, e5e7, e5f6, e5e6, e5d6, e5d5, e5c5, e5b5, e5a5, e5e4, e5d4, e5e3, e5c3, e5e2, e5b2, e5a1:** The queen moves don't seem to help.
*   **f4g3, f4e3, f4h2, f4d2, f4c1:** The bishop moves don't seem to help.
*   **f3h4, f3d4, f3h2, f3d2, f3g1, f3e1:** The knight moves don't seem to help.
*   **c7d6:** This pawn move doesn't help.
*   **f5g4:** This pawn move doesn't help.
*   **b7b6, a7a6, b7b5:** These pawn moves don't help.

I think the best move here is to develop my knight to d5. It attacks the queen and controls a central square.

Okay, I've got a lot of moves to consider. The most pressing issue is the threat to my king. White's rook on e1 is a major threat. I need to find a move that addresses this.

Let's analyze the possibilities:

*   **Rook moves (h8):** Moving the rook doesn't seem to directly address the immediate threat.
*   **Pawn moves (g7, f7, e5, d5, c7, b7, a7):** Some pawn moves could help, but none immediately block the attack.
*   **Bishop moves (f4):** The bishop on f4 has some interesting options, but moving it doesn't seem to solve the immediate problem.
*   **Knight moves (f3):** The knight on f3 has some options, but none seem to directly address the threat.
*   **Knight moves (f5):** The knight on f5 has some options, but none seem to directly address the threat.

The most promising move seems to be to move the queen to defend the king.

I will move my queen to e7 to defend the king and potentially counterattack.

Let's consider a few options:

*   **...h8h7:** This move doesn't really help. It just shuffles the rook.
*   **...e7e6:** This blocks the white queen's attack on the king and opens up the diagonal for the bishop.
*   **...f7f6:** This supports the king and prepares to move the pawn to f5.
*   **...f4e3:** This attacks the white bishop and opens up the diagonal for the bishop.

Considering the position, I think the best move is to defend the king and develop a piece. I will move the pawn to e6.

Okay, I have a lot of options. White's attack is focused on the kingside, so I need to address that. The rook on h8 is currently doing nothing. I could move it to h7 to defend the g7 pawn. Moving the rook to h6 or h5 might also be useful in the long run. The pawn on g7 is also vulnerable. I could move the king to g8 to protect the pawn and move the rook to h7.

Let's try to consolidate the defense. Moving the rook to h7 seems like a good first step.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Okay, that's a lot of moves. Let's analyze them.

*   **Pawn moves:** I have several pawn moves available. Pushing the h-pawn seems pointless. The f-pawn can promote, but that doesn't seem immediately helpful. The e-pawn has a lot of options, but I don't want to weaken my king's defense. The c-pawn and b-pawn can challenge the center.
*   **Knight moves:** The knight on f3 has some options, but none seem particularly strong.
*   **Bishop moves:** The bishop on f4 has some interesting diagonals.
*   **Rook moves:** The rooks are currently blocked.
*   **Queen moves:** The queen on e6 has many options, but I need to be careful not to leave her exposed.

Considering the position, I think the most important thing is to develop a piece and try to control the center. **...c5** looks like a good developing move that challenges white's control of the center.

*   **h7h8=Q, h7h8=R, h7h8=B, h7h8=N:** Promoting the pawn on h7. Promoting to a Queen seems like the best option to help defend the King.
*   **e6e8, e6e7, e6d7:** Moving the Queen.
*   **f4e3, f4e5:** Moving the Bishop.
*   **d5c6, d5e4, d5c4, d5b3:** Moving the Bishop.

The most pressing issue is the attack on the King. I need to find a move that immediately addresses this. Promoting the h-pawn to a Queen seems like the best immediate defense.

You are a professional chess player and you play as black. Now is your turn to make a move. Before making a move you can pick one of the following actions:
- 'get_current_board' to get the schema and current status of the board
- 'get_legal_moves' to get a UCI formatted list of available moves
- 'make_move <UCI formatted move>' when you are ready to complete your turn (e.g., 'make_move e2e4')

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, I've got a lot of options. White's queen on e5 is a major threat. I need to consider how to defend against it and develop my pieces.

*   **h8h7:** This move seems passive.
*   **g7f6, g7h6:** These moves don't seem to help much.
*   **e6e7:** This blocks the queen's attack on the king, but doesn't develop a piece.
*   **d5c6, d5e4, d5c4:** These moves with the bishop seem interesting, but need to be considered carefully.
*   **f4e3, f4g3:** These moves with the bishop don't seem to help much.
*   **b7b6, b7b5:** These pawn moves don't seem to help much.
*   **c5c4:** This pawn move doesn't seem to help much.

I think the most critical threat is the Queen on e5. I need to develop a piece to defend against it. I'll move my bishop to defend the king.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Okay, I have a few options.

*   **g7g8=Q:** Promoting the pawn to a queen seems tempting, but it might lead to a quick exchange and doesn't immediately address the threat.
*   **g7f7:** This is a defensive move, blocking the rook's attack on the king.
*   **g7h6:** This move doesn't seem to help much.
*   **f6f7:** This move doesn't seem to help much.
*   **d5f7:** This move doesn't seem to help much.

I think the most important thing is to defend the king. **g7f7** seems like the most solid move.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, I've got a lot of options. Let's analyze them:

*   **h8...**: The rook moves. Not immediately threatening, but could be useful for defense or attack later.
*   **f7...**: The pawn moves. Doesn't seem to help much in the immediate attack.
*   **f6...**: The knight moves. Several options, some attacking the queen, some defending.
*   **d5...**: The bishop moves. Could attack the queen or control key squares.
*   **f4...**: The bishop moves. This is the most interesting. It attacks the white king directly.
*   **f3...**: The knight moves.
*   **b7...**: The pawn moves.
*   **g5g4**: The pawn moves.
*   **c5c4**: The pawn moves.
*   **b7b5**: The pawn moves.

The most forcing move seems to be the bishop on f4 attacking the king. This forces White to respond immediately. I will move the bishop on f4 to e3, attacking the king.

*   **...f6d4:** This attacks the white bishop on e3.
*   **...d5e4:** This attacks the white bishop on e3.
*   **...g5g4:** This advances the pawn.

The most active moves seem to be those that attack the white bishops. I'll choose to attack the bishop on e3.

Okay, that's a lot of moves! Let's analyze them.

*   **Rook moves (h8...):** Moving the rook doesn't seem to immediately help.
*   **Pawn moves (f7...):** Moving the pawn doesn't seem to help either.
*   **Bishop moves (d4...):** The bishop on d4 has a lot of options, but many of them don't seem to improve my position significantly.
*   **Knight moves (f3...):** The knight on f3 has some options, but none seem particularly strong.
*   **Queen moves (e3...):** The queen on e3 has some options, but none seem particularly strong.
*   **Pawn moves (b7...):** b7b6 and b7b5 are options, but don't seem to address the immediate threats.
*   **Pawn moves (g5g4):** This weakens my pawn structure.
*   **Pawn moves (c5...):** c5c4 is an option.

The most pressing issue is the attack on my king. I need to find a move that defends against this. Looking at the board, the most immediate threat seems to be the white rook on e5. I can move my bishop on d4 to defend it.

I'll move my bishop to f6, defending the e5 square.

*   **f6d6:** This develops the knight and attacks the white bishop.
*   **d5e4:** This attacks the white bishop.

I think the best move here is to develop the knight and attack the white queen. Let's go with f6e7.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, I have a lot of options. Let's analyze them.

*   **Pawn moves:** I have many pawn moves. `h8h7` seems like a reasonable defensive move, and `b7b6` and `g5g4` are standard pawn moves.
*   **Bishop moves:** The bishop on f3 has a lot of options, but they don't seem to immediately help.
*   **Other moves:** The other moves don't seem to address the immediate threats.

I think the best move here is to try to defend the king. I will move the rook from h8 to h7.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Okay, I have a lot of options. Let's analyze them:

*   **Pawn moves:** h7-h8, h7-g7, h7-h6, h7-h5, h7-h4, h7-h3, f7-g8, f7-f8, f7-e8, f7-g7, f7-f6, e7-f8, e7-e8, e7-d8, e7-d7, e7-c7, e7-f6, e7-e6, e7-d6, e7-e5, e7-e4, d5-e6, d5-c6, d5-e4, d5-c4, d5-b3, d5-a2, b7-a6, b7-b6, g5-g4, c5-c4, b7-b5. These are mostly developing moves, but some are more critical than others. Promoting the h-pawn is tempting, but probably not the best use of resources right now.

*   **Knight moves:** f3-e5, f3-h4, f3-d4, f3-h2, f3-d2, f3-g1, f3-e1. The knight on f3 is a bit awkward. Moving it doesn't seem to immediately solve any problems.

*   **Bishop moves:** e3-f4, e3-d4, e3-f2, e3-d2, e3-c1. The bishop on e3 is also a bit passive.

Considering the position, I need to address the immediate threat to my king. White has a rook on e5 and a bishop on h6, and I need to find a way to defend.

The most pressing issue is the potential checkmate threat. I think the best move is to move the pawn on h7 to h6 to block the check from the white bishop.

Okay, that's a lot of moves. The immediate threat is the white rook on e1. I need to address that. Let's see...

*   **f7g8, f7f8, f7e8:** These are pawn promotions.
*   **f7g7, f7f6:** These are pawn moves.
*   **e7f8, e7e8, e7d8:** These are queen moves.
*   **e7d7, e7c7, e7f6, e7e6, e7d6, e7e5, e7e4:** These are queen moves.
*   **h6h8, h6h7, h6g6, h6f6, h6e6, h6d6, h6c6, h6b6, h6a6, h6h5, h6h4, h6h3:** These are knight moves.
*   **d5e6, d5c6, d5e4, d5c4, d5b3, d5a2:** These are bishop moves.
*   **f3e5, f3h4, f3d4, f3h2, f3d2, f3g1, f3e1:** These are knight moves.
*   **e3f4, e3d4, e3f2, e3d2, e3c1:** These are bishop moves.
*   **b7a6, c5b4, b7b6, g5g4, c5c4, b7b5:** These are pawn moves.

The most pressing issue is the threat to the king. I need to move the queen to defend. The move **e7e8** looks like a good option, promoting the pawn to a queen and defending the king.

Alright, that's a lot of moves! Let's analyze the position and narrow down the options.

*   **King Safety:** My king is currently exposed. I need to consider moves that improve its safety.
*   **Piece Activity:** I want to develop my pieces and control key squares.
*   **Tactical Considerations:** Are there any immediate threats or opportunities?

Looking at the moves, I see a few interesting possibilities:

*   **...Qe7:** This develops the queen and potentially prepares for castling.
*   **...h6-h5:** This challenges white's control of the h-file and could open lines for my rook.
*   **...f7-f6:** This supports the king and prepares to develop the knight.

I'm leaning towards developing the queen and improving king safety.

Alright, I have a lot of options. Let's analyze the most critical ones. White's immediate threat is the rook on e1.

*   **Defensive moves:** I need to consider moves that directly defend against the attack.
    *   `f7f6` or `f7f8` doesn't seem to help much.
    *   `e7e6` or `e7e5` doesn't immediately block the attack.
    *   `h6h5` or `h6h4` doesn't help.
    *   `d5e6` or `d5c6` doesn't help.
    *   `b7b6` or `b7b5` doesn't help.
*   **Counterattack:** I need to look for counterplay.
    *   `f7g6` or `f7g8` doesn't help.
    *   `e7f8` or `e7e8` doesn't help.
    *   `h6g6` or `h6f6` doesn't help.
    *   `d5e4` or `d5c4` doesn't help.
    *   `b7a6` or `c5b4` or `c5c4` doesn't help.

The most promising move appears to be to move the queen to defend the king.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

That's a lot of options. Let's analyze. The most immediate threat seems to be the white rook on h1. I need to consider how to defend against that.

*   **f7g8, f7f8, f7e8**: These are pawn promotions. I don't see an immediate need to promote.
*   **f7g6, f7f6**: These are pawn moves.
*   **h6h8, h6h7, h6g6, h6f6, h6h5, h6h4, h6h3, h6h2**: These are knight moves.
*   **e6e8, e6c8, e6e7, e6d7, e6f6, e6d6, e6c6, e6b6, e6a6, e6f5, e6e5, e6g4, e6e4**: These are queen moves.
*   **d5c6, d5e4, d5c4, d5b3, d5a2**: These are bishop moves.
*   **f3e5, f3h4, f3d4, f3h2, f3d2, f3g1, f3e1**: These are bishop moves.
*   **e3f4, e3d4, e3f2, e3d2, e3c1**: These are bishop moves.
*   **b7a6, b7b6, b7b5**: These are pawn moves.
*   **c5b4, c5c4**: These are pawn moves.

The queen on e6 is a powerful piece. I could move the queen to defend the pawn on f7, but that doesn't seem to be the best use of the queen. I could also move the queen to attack the white king.

I think I will move my queen to attack the white king and put pressure on the center.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Okay, I have a lot of options. Let's analyze them.

*   **Pawn moves:** `f7g8`, `f7f8`, `f7e8` are pawn promotions. `f7g6`, `f7f6` are pawn moves. `h6h8`, `h6h7`, `h6g6`, `h6f6`, `h6h5`, `h6h4`, `h6h3`, `h6h2` are pawn moves. `b7a6`, `b7b6`, `b7b5`, `c5b4`, `c5c4` are pawn moves.
*   **Bishop moves:** `d5e6`, `d5c6`, `d5c4`, `d5b3`, `d5a2` are bishop moves.
*   **Queen moves:** `e4e8`, `e4h7`, `e4e7`, `e4g6`, `e4e6`, `e4f5`, `e4e5`, `e4g4`, `e4f4`, `e4d4`, `e4c4`, `e4b4`, `e4e3`, `e4d3`, `e4c2`, `e4b1` are queen moves.
*   **Knight moves:** `f3e5`, `f3h4`, `f3d4`, `f3h2`, `f3d2`, `f3g1`, `f3e1` are knight moves.

The immediate threat is the white queen. I need to address that. Moving the queen seems like the most active response. `e4e3` attacks the white pawn on f2 and potentially opens lines for my pieces.

Okay, I've got a lot of options. The most pressing issue is the threat to the king. Let's analyze the moves:

*   **Pawn moves (f7g8, f7f8, f7e8, f7g6, f7f6):** These don't immediately address the threat and some lead to further problems.
*   **h6 moves (h6h8, h6h7, h6g6, h6f6, h6h5, h6h4, h6h3):** These are pawn moves that don't help.
*   **d5 moves (d5e6, d5c6, d5e4, d5c4, d5b3, d5a2):** These are bishop moves. The bishop on d5 is currently defending the king. Moving it away would be a mistake.
*   **f3 moves (f3e5, f3h4, f3d4, f3h2, f3d2, f3g1, f3e1):** These are knight moves. The knight on f3 is defending the king. Moving it away would be a mistake.
*   **e3 moves (e3e8, e3e7, e3e6, e3e5, e3f4, e3e4, e3d4, e3d3, e3c3, e3b3, e3a3, e3f2, e3e2, e3d2, e3g1, e3c1):** These are queen moves. The queen is the key defender.
*   **b7 moves (b7a6, b7b6, b7b5):** These are pawn moves.
*   **c5 moves (c5b4, c5c4):** These are pawn moves.

The most critical move is to move the queen to defend the king. The queen on e3 can move to e7 to block the queen's attack.

Alright, I have a list of legal moves. The most pressing concern is the exposed king. I see a few options to improve the king's safety, and I need to evaluate them.

*   **h6h5, h6h4, h6h3:** These pawn moves don't immediately address the king's safety.
*   **f7g6, f7f6, f7g8, f7f8, f7e8, f7e6, f7d6, f7e5, f7e4, f7e3, f7e2:** These pawn moves don't seem to help.
*   **e7f8, e7e8, e7d8, e7d7, e7c7, e7f6, e7e6, e7d6, e7e5, e7e4, e7e3, e7e2:** These pawn moves don't seem to help.
*   **d5e6, d5c6, d5e4, d5c4, d5b3, d5a2:** These bishop moves are interesting, but don't immediately address the king's safety.
*   **f3e5, f3h4, f3d4, f3h2, f3d2, f3g1, f3e1:** These knight moves are interesting, but don't immediately address the king's safety.
*   **b7a6, b7b6, b7b5:** These pawn moves don't immediately address the king's safety.
*   **c5b4, c5c4:** These pawn moves don't immediately address the king's safety.

The most promising move seems to be to move the pawn in front of the king to help protect it. I'll move the pawn from f7 to f6. This blocks a potential check from the white rook on h1.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Okay, I have a lot of options. Let's analyze them.

*   **Queen moves:** The queen has a lot of moves, but many of them don't immediately help. Qe8 is interesting, but it doesn't solve the immediate threat. Qh7, Qg7, Qf7, Qd7, Qc7, Qe6, Qd6, Qc5, Qe5, Qe4, Qe3, Qe2 are all possible, but none seem to be a clear best move.
*   **Pawn moves:** h6-h5 looks like a reasonable developing move. b7-b6 and b7-b5 are also options.
*   **Knight moves:** The knight on f3 has a lot of moves, but none seem to be particularly strong.
*   **Bishop moves:** The bishop on d5 has a lot of moves, but none immediately help.
*   **King moves:** The king is in check, so I need to move it.

The most critical thing is to get the king out of check. The queen can't block the check. The only move that gets the king out of check is to move the king.

Therefore, the best move is to move the king.

Okay, that's a lot of moves. Let's analyze. White's rook on h1 and the queen on d8 are a threat. I need to find a move that addresses this.

*   **Pawn moves:** The pawn moves don't seem to help much in the immediate defense.
*   **Knight moves:** The knight on f3 has a lot of options, but none seem to directly address the threat.
*   **Bishop moves:** The bishop on d5 has some interesting diagonal options.
*   **Rook moves:** The rook on h6 has some options, but they don't seem to help.

The most promising move seems to be with the bishop on d5. I can move it to protect the king. Let's try ...Bf7.

*   **g7h8, g7g8, g7f8:** These pawn promotions don't immediately help.
*   **g7h7, g7g6, g7f6:** These pawn moves don't address the immediate threat.
*   **f7g8, f7e8, f7g6, f7e6, f7h5, f7d5, f7c4, f7b3, f7a2:** These pawn moves are not helpful.
*   **e7f8, e7e8, e7d8, e7d7, e7c7, e7b7, e7f6, e7e6, e7d6, e7e5, e7c5, e7e4, e7b4, e7e3, e7a3, e7e2:** These pawn moves are not helpful.
*   **h6h8, h6h7, h6g6, h6f6, h6e6, h6d6, h6c6, h6b6, h6a6, h6h5, h6h4, h6h3:** These knight moves don't help.
*   **f3e5, f3h4, f3d4, f3h2, f3d2, f3g1, f3e1:** These knight moves don't help.

The most critical threat is the white rook on e5. I need to block the checkmate threat. I can move the pawn from e7 to e6.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Okay, that's a lot of moves. Let's analyze the most critical ones. White's queen is a major threat. I need to consider moves that defend the king or attack the queen.

*   **g7h8, g7g8, g7f8**: These are pawn promotions. Promoting to a queen is tempting, but it doesn't immediately solve the problem. Promoting to a rook or bishop might be better in some situations.
*   **g7h7, g7g6, g7f6**: These pawn moves don't seem to help much.
*   **f7g8, f7e8**: These are pawn promotions.
*   **h6h8, h6h7, h6g6, h6f6, h6h5, h6h4, h6h3**: These pawn moves don't seem to help much.
*   **e6...**: The moves involving the queen are the most interesting.
    *   **e6e8, e6c8**: These moves don't seem to help.
    *   **e6e7**: This blocks the queen's attack on the king, but it might not be enough.
    *   **e6d7**: This attacks the queen.
    *   **e6g6, e6f6, e6d6, e6c6, e6b6, e6a6**: These moves don't seem to help.
    *   **e6f5, e6e5, e6d5**: These moves don't seem to help.
    *   **e6g4, e6e4, e6c4, e6e3, e6b3, e6e2, e6a2**: These moves don't seem to help.
*   **f3...**: The knight moves don't seem to help.

**My Plan:**

The most promising move seems to be **e6d7**. This attacks the white queen and forces a response. It also opens a line for my rook.

I will make the move **e6d7**.

Alright, I have a list of legal moves. The most pressing issue is the threat to the king. The knight on f6 is a real problem. I see a few options to address this:

*   **...g7h8=Q:** This promotes the pawn to a queen, which could help defend the king.
*   **...g7g6:** This blocks the knight's attack and prepares to develop the bishop.
*   **...h6g6:** This also blocks the knight's attack.

Considering the position, I think the most active defense is to develop the pawn and block the knight's attack. I will choose ...g7g6.

I think the best move here is to move the pawn on f7 to e6. This blocks the knight's attack on the king and opens a line for my bishop.

Okay, I see the board. Black's king is somewhat exposed. White has a strong queen and a rook battery on the h-file. I need to be careful. Let's see what moves are available.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Okay, I have a lot of options. Let's analyze a bit.

*   **King moves:** Moving the king is risky right now, as it could expose it further.
*   **Pawn moves:** g5-g4 looks interesting, attacking the white pawn on f3.
*   **Knight moves:** The knight moves don't seem to immediately improve the position.

I think the most active move is to challenge the white pawn on f3.

Alright, I have a good number of options. The most pressing thing is to defend against any immediate threats. White's rook on h4 is a potential threat to my king. I also want to develop my pieces and put pressure on the white king.

I think the best move here is to develop my knight to a square where it attacks the white king and also defends against any immediate threats.

I will move my knight from f3 to h4, attacking the white king.

*   **Pawn moves (h6...):** h6h5 looks like a good defensive move, blocking the rook's attack.
*   **Pawn moves (g6...):** g6f6 or g6f7 could be useful to develop a pawn and potentially open lines for the king to escape.
*   **Pawn moves (g4g3):** This pawn move doesn't seem to help the king's safety.

I think the best move here is to defend the king directly.

Let's analyze the possibilities:

*   **...Nh7:** This seems like a good defensive move, blocking the knight's attack on the king and potentially preparing to attack the white king.
*   **...Nf5:** This attacks the white king directly and forces a response.
*   **...g3:** This is a pawn move that doesn't seem to immediately help.

I think the most forcing move is to attack the king directly.

Moving the king to h8 seems like the best immediate defense. It gets the king out of the direct line of fire.

*   **g6h7, g6g7, g6f7, g6h6, g6f6, g6h5, g6g5:** Pawn moves. Advancing the pawn to g5 looks like a good defensive move, blocking the white bishop's attack on the king.
*   **f5f8, f5f7, f5f6, f5h5, f5g5, f5e5, f5d5, f5c5, f5b5, f5f4, f5f3, f5f2, f5f1:** These are all the pawn moves.
*   **h4f3, h4g2:** Knight moves.
*   **a7b6:** Pawn move.
*   **g4g3:** Pawn move.

*   **h8g8, h8f8, h8e8, h8d8, h8c8, h8h7, h8g7, h8h6, h8f6, h8h5, h8e5, h8d4, h8c3, h8b2, h8a1:** These are all queen moves, but they don't seem to address the immediate threats or develop my pieces effectively.
*   **g5h6, g5g6, g5f6, g5h5, g5f4:** These are knight moves. The knight on h4 is a bit awkward. Moving it to f3 looks interesting, as it attacks the white pawn on e5.
*   **f5f8, f5f7, f5f6, f5e5, f5d5, f5c5, f5b5, f5f4, f5f3, f5f2, f5f1:** These are pawn moves. Pushing the pawn on f5 doesn't seem to achieve much.
*   **h4g6, h4f3, h4g2:** The knight on h4 is a bit awkward. Moving it to f3 looks interesting, as it attacks the white pawn on e5.
*   **a7b6:** This pawn move doesn't seem to help.
*   **g4g3:** This pawn move doesn't seem to help.

I think the best move here is to develop my knight and attack the white pawn on e5. This will also help to protect my king.

Okay, I have a few options. The pawn on g5 is under attack. I can move the pawn to g4, g6, or h4, h5, h6, f4, f6. The knight on f3 can move to h4.

Moving the pawn to g4 seems like a bad idea as it opens up the g file for the white rook. Moving the pawn to g6 seems like a good defensive move. Moving the pawn to h6 or h5 doesn't seem to do much. Moving the pawn to f6 is not good. Moving the knight to h4 is not good.

Therefore, I will move the pawn on g5 to g6 to defend the king.

Alright, I have a list of legal moves. The white queen on h8 is a serious threat. I need to address that immediately.

Looking at the moves, I see I can move my pawn from g6 to g7. This doesn't directly address the queen, but it does protect my king. I also see I can move my pawn from f5 to f6 or f7. Moving f5 to f6 would block the queen's attack on the king.

I think the best move here is to block the queen's attack and develop a pawn.

*   **h8h7, h8g7, h8h6, h8h5, h8h4:** Moving the queen to these squares doesn't seem to help either.
*   **f6g7, f6f7, f6e7, f6g6, f6e5:** The knight moves don't seem to address the immediate danger.
*   **f5h5, f5g5, f5e5, f5d5, f5c5, f5b5, f5f4:** The pawn moves don't help.
*   **f3g5, f3e5, f3h4, f3d4, f3h2, f3d2, f3g1, f3e1:** The rook moves don't help.
*   **a7b6:** This pawn move does nothing.
*   **g3g2:** This pawn move does nothing.

It looks like I'm in a tough spot. The best I can do is try to trade off the queen for a rook and a bishop to alleviate the attack.

Okay, I see the board. White has a significant material advantage, including a queen and a rook. My king is also exposed. I need to find a move that addresses the immediate threats and tries to create some counterplay. Let's get the legal moves.

g6g8,g6e8,g6h7,g6g7,g6f7,g6h6,g6h5,g6g5,g6g4,f6g7,f6e7,f6e5,f5h5,f5g5,f5e5,f5d5,f5c5,f5b5,f5f4,f3g5,f3e5,f3h4,f3d4,f3h2,f3d2,f3g1,f3e1,a7b6,g3g2

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, I have a list of legal moves. Let's analyze them.

*   **Pawn moves:** g6g8, g6e8, g6h7, g6g7, g6f7, g6h6, g6h5, g6g5, g6g4, f6g7, f6e7, f6e5, f5h5, f5g5, f5e5, f5d5, f5c5, f5b5, f5f4, g3g2. These are mostly pawn moves, some of which are to defend the king.
*   **Knight moves:** f3g5, f3e5, f3h4, f3d4, f3h2, f3d2, f3g1, f3e1. These are knight moves.
*   **Bishop moves:** a7b6. This is a bishop move.

The most pressing issue is the threat to my king. The white queen is a major threat. I need to find a move that either blocks the queen's attack or develops a threat of my own.

Looking at the board, I see that moving the pawn on g6 to g5 could potentially open a line of attack against the white king. However, it also weakens the defense of my king.

Let's try to develop a counterattack. I will move the pawn on f6 to e5. This attacks the knight and opens up a line for my queen.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, I've got a lot of options. The most pressing concern is the attack on my King. I need to find a move that addresses that.

Let's analyze the moves:

*   **Pawn moves (g6...):** These seem to be mostly about developing my pawn structure, but don't immediately address the threat.
*   **Pawn moves (f5...):** These are similar to the g6 moves.
*   **Pawn moves (e5...):** e5e4 looks interesting, opening a line for my Queen.
*   **Knight moves (f3...):** These don't seem to help the immediate situation.
*   **Pawn moves (a7b6):** This doesn't seem to help.
*   **Pawn moves (g3g2):** This doesn't seem to help.

The most promising move seems to be **e5e4**. This opens a line for my Queen to potentially defend and also attacks the white pawn on f2.

*   **f6f8, f6f7, f6e6, f6d6, f6c6, f6b6, f6a6, f6f5, f6f4:** These are knight moves. The knight on f6 has a wide range of possible moves.
*   **e4f5, e4e5, e4e3, e4d3:** These are king moves. The king on e5 can move one square in any direction.
*   **f3g5, f3e5, f3h4, f3d4, f3h2, f3d2, f3g1, f3e1:** These are rook moves. The rook on b7 has a wide range of possible moves.

Okay, I see the board. Black's king is on e5. White has a rook on g7, a knight on f6, and a bishop on f7. Black has a pawn on a7, a pawn on g6, and a queen on g3. Let's get the legal moves.

Okay, I have the legal moves. The most pressing threat is the white rook on g7. It's currently attacking the g6 pawn. I need to address that. I can move the g6 pawn forward to g5, which attacks the rook. Let's make that move.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, I've got the legal moves. The queen on g4 is putting some pressure on the king. I need to find a good defensive move. Let's consider the options.

*   **f8h8, f8g8, f8e8, f8d8, f8c8, f8f7:** Moving the rook doesn't seem to immediately address the threat.
*   **g4g8, g4c8, g4g7, g4d7, g4g6, g4e6, g4h5, g4g5, g4f5, g4h4, g4f4, g4h3:** These are the queen's moves, and I need to react to them.
*   **e4f5, e4e5, e4e3, e4d3:** Pawn moves don't seem to help.
*   **f3g5, f3e5, f3h4, f3d4, f3h2, f3d2, f3g1, f3e1:** Knight moves.
*   **g3g2:** Pawn move.

The most pressing threat is the queen on g4. I need to move my knight to defend. The knight on f3 can move to either g5 or h4 to attack the queen. Let's go with **f3g5**. This attacks the queen and forces a response.

Now, I need to see what moves are available to me.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, I've got the legal moves. Let's analyze them.

*   **f8h8, f8g8, f8e8, f8d8, f8c8:** These are potential moves for the bishop on f7.
*   **f8f7:** This is a null move for the bishop, which is not allowed.
*   **g5h7, g5f7, g5e6, g5h3, g5f3:** These are queen moves.
*   **g4c8, g4d7, g4e6, g4h5, g4f5, g4h4, g4f4, g4h3, g4f3, g4e2, g4d1:** These are knight moves.
*   **e4f5, e4e5, e4f3, e4e3, e4d3:** These are king moves.
*   **g3g2:** This is a pawn move.

The most pressing issue is the threat to my king. White's queen on g5 is attacking my king. I need to move my king.

I can move my king to f5, f3, e3, or d3. Moving to f5 seems like the best option, as it gets my king away from the queen and doesn't block any of my pieces.

Alright, I have a good list of moves. The position is relatively open, and I need to develop my pieces and control the center. I see a few options.

*   **... Nf6:** This is a standard developing move, controlling central squares and preparing to challenge white's control.
*   **... e6:** This supports the pawn structure and prepares to develop the light-squared bishop.
*   **... d6:** Similar to e6, it supports the pawn structure.

I think ...Nf6 is the most active and flexible move. It develops a piece to a good square and doesn't commit me to a specific pawn structure immediately.

*   **Queen moves:** The Queen has a lot of options.
*   **Bishop moves:** The bishops have some options.
*   **Rook moves:** The rooks don't have any moves.
*   **King moves:** The king doesn't have any moves.

Considering the position, I think developing a piece is a good idea. I'll develop the knight.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, I've got a list of possible moves. Let's consider a few options.

*   **...d7f6 or ...d7b6:** These are knight moves. Developing the knight is generally a good idea, but the squares don't seem particularly active right now.
*   **...h7h6, ...g7g6, ...f7f6, ...e7e6, ...c7c6, ...b7b6, ...a7a6:** These are pawn moves. Pushing pawns in front of the pawns is a standard opening move.
*   **...d7e5, ...d7c5:** These are knight moves. Developing the knight is generally a good idea, but the squares don't seem particularly active right now.
*   **...h7h5, ...g7g5, ...f7f5, ...e7e5, ...c7c5, ...b7b5:** These are pawn moves. Pushing pawns in front of the pawns is a standard opening move.

I think I'll start by developing a pawn. I'll play **...e7e6**. This controls the center and prepares for further development.

Alright, I have a list of legal moves. White is clearly trying to attack the Black king. I need to develop my pieces and try to create some counterplay.

Considering the position, I think I should develop my knight to a more active square. The move ...Nb8-c6 looks like a good developing move, controlling central squares and potentially supporting a pawn advance.

That's a lot of moves! Let's analyze the position a bit. White has a strong attack developing, especially with the queen on d5. Black's king is a bit exposed. I need to be careful.

I see a few candidate moves:

*   **Defensive:** Moving the king to safety (e8f8, e8d8).
*   **Developing:** Bringing pieces into the game (e7f6, e7d6, etc.).
*   **Counterattacking:** Trying to create some threats against white (h7h6, g7g6, etc.).

Given the immediate threat, I think the most important thing is to get the king to safety. e8f8 looks like a good option.

Okay, I see the board. White has a strong attack developing, especially with the Rook on d4 and the Queen eyeing the kingside. I need to defend and develop my pieces. Let's see what my legal moves are.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, I have a lot of options. White's threat is immediate, so I need to be careful.

*   **Defensive Considerations:** The most immediate threat seems to be the Queen and Rook on the d-file. I need to consider moves that address this.
*   **Development:** I need to develop my pieces to counterattack.
*   **Pawn Structure:** I need to be mindful of my pawn structure and avoid weakening it unnecessarily.

Let's analyze some of the moves:

*   **...h7h6:** This is a standard move, but it doesn't address the immediate threats.
*   **...e7e5:** This challenges the center and opens lines for my pieces, but it might be too slow.
*   **...f7f6:** This supports the e5 advance, but it also blocks the bishop on f8.
*   **...d7d6:** This is a solid move that supports the e5 advance and blocks the rook on d4.
*   **...e7f6:** This develops the knight, but it doesn't address the immediate threats.
*   **...h4h6:** This is a pawn move that doesn't help.

Considering the position, I think the best move is to challenge the center and develop a piece.

I'll play **e7e5**. This opens lines for my pieces, challenges the center, and prepares for further development.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, I have a lot of options. Let's break this down.

*   **Developing moves:** `c8d7` develops the bishop, which is good. `h8g8` and `f8g8` are not good, as they don't develop anything.
*   **Pawn moves:** `h7h6`, `g7g6`, `f7f6`, `b7b6`, `a7a6` are all passive and don't really help. `h7h5`, `f7f5`, `b7b5` are more active, but might weaken my pawn structure.
*   **Knight moves:** `e7f6` develops the knight and attacks the center. `e7d6` is also a developing move.
*   **Other knight moves:** `c6d8`, `c6b8`, `c6a5`, `c6d4`, `c6b4` are not good.
*   **Other moves:** `e5d7`, `e5g6`, `e5g4`, `e5c4`, `e5f3`, `e5d3` are not good.
*   **Pawn moves:** `h4h6`, `h4h5`, `h4g5`, `h4g4`, `h4f4`, `h4e4`, `h4h3`, `h4g3`, `h4h2`, `h4f2` are not good.

I think the best move here is to develop my knight to f6, challenging white's control of the center.

Okay, I have the list of legal moves. Let's analyze the position. Black's king is somewhat exposed. White has a strong attack potential with the queen and rook on the open file. Black needs to develop pieces and defend.

The move ...h7-h6 looks like a good prophylactic move to prevent a potential attack on the h-file. It also gives the king a little more space.

Therefore, I'll play h7-h6.

Alright, I have a lot of options. White is threatening my king, so I need to prioritize defense. Let's analyze the moves.

*   **h8g8, h8h7:** Moving the rook doesn't seem to help much.
*   **f8g8, f8e8, f8e7:** Moving the bishop is also not immediately helpful.
*   **c8d7:** Developing the bishop is a good idea, but doesn't address the immediate threat.
*   **a8b8:** Moving the rook is not helpful.
*   **f6d8, f6e7, f6g5, c6d8, c6b8, c6e7, c6a5, c6d4, c6b4:** These knight moves are interesting, but none of them seem to offer immediate defense.
*   **e5d7, e5g6, e5g4, e5c4, e5f3, e5d3:** These knight moves are also not helpful.
*   **h4h5, h4g5, h4g4, h4f4, h4e4, h4h3, h4g3, h4h2, h4f2:** These pawn moves don't seem to help.
*   **c7b6, a7b6, h6g5, g7g6, a7a6, h6h5:** These pawn moves are not helpful.

The most pressing threat seems to be from the white queen and rook. I think the best move is to develop my bishop to d7, blocking the queen's attack and potentially preparing for a counterattack.

*   **c7b6, a7b6, h6g5, e6d5, g7g6, c7c6, a7a6, h6h5, c7c5:** These are pawn moves.

The most promising moves seem to be developing my pieces and trying to create some counterplay. I think I'll develop my bishop to e7.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Okay, that's a lot of moves. Let's analyze them.

*   **Rook moves:** The rooks on a8 and h8 have many options, but most of them don't immediately improve my position.
*   **Pawn moves:** I see several pawn moves. g7-g6 seems like a standard developing move, and h6-h5 could be interesting.
*   **Bishop moves:** The bishop on f8 has a few moves, but none seem particularly strong.
*   **Knight moves:** The knight on e5 has several options. e5-g6 attacks the queen, but it allows the white knight to attack my queen. e5-c6 looks interesting, controlling important squares.
*   **Queen moves:** The queen on d4 has many moves, but none seem to be immediately threatening.
*   **King moves:** The king is safe for now.

Considering the position, I think the best move is to develop my knight and control the center.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Okay, that's a lot of moves. Let's analyze the most critical threats and then find a good defensive move.

White's queen on d5 is a major threat. White also has a knight on f6 that could potentially attack my king. I need to address these threats.

Looking at the moves, I see a few options:

*   **...h7h6**: This seems like a passive move, but it prevents a potential knight jump to g5 attacking my king.
*   **...g7g6**: This also supports the king and prepares to move the pawn to g5.
*   **...f7e6**: This opens the diagonal for my bishop, but it also weakens the pawn structure in front of the king.
*   **...h8h7**: This seems like a good defensive move to protect the rook.

Considering the threats and the need for a solid defense, I'll go with **...h7h6**. This move prevents the knight from jumping to g5 and prepares to move the pawn to g5.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Okay, I have a lot of options. Let's analyze them.

*   **Rook moves:** The rook moves don't seem immediately impactful.
*   **Bishop moves:** The bishop on f8 has limited options. The bishop on d7 has more potential, but moving it now doesn't seem to achieve much.
*   **King moves:** The king is safe for now.
*   **Pawn moves:** Pushing the h-pawn to h5 looks interesting, potentially opening the h-file for an attack. Pushing the b-pawn to b5 or b6 is also a possibility to challenge the center.
*   **Knight moves:** The knight on c6 has a few options, but none immediately threaten anything.
*   **Queen moves:** The queen is well-placed.

I'm leaning towards developing my pieces and creating some pressure. The move **h6h5** looks like a good developing move that also starts to open the h-file.

*   **e7e8**: This is a pawn promotion. Promoting to a queen seems tempting, but it might not be the best in this position.
*   **e7d8**: This is also a pawn promotion, but to a knight. This could be interesting, but I need to evaluate the position more carefully.
*   **e7e6**: This is a standard pawn push, controlling the center.
*   **c6b4**: This is a knight move.

I think pushing the pawn to e6 is a good developing move, challenging white's control of the center.

*   **Pawn moves:** Pushing the h-pawn seems pointless. Pushing the e-pawn to e5 looks interesting, as it challenges the center. Pushing the b-pawn or a-pawn doesn't seem to help.
*   **King moves:** No safe king moves.

I think the most promising move is to challenge the center with **e6e5**. This opens lines for my bishop and knight and restricts white's queen.

Okay, I see the board. White has a strong attack developing, and my king is a bit exposed. I need to be careful. Let's get the legal moves to see what options I have.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, I've got a lot of options. White's queen is a major threat, and I need to address that. Let's analyze a few moves:

*   **...Qh3:** This attacks the white queen and forces a trade or a retreat. It also opens up a potential attack on the white king.
*   **...Nf5:** This attacks the white queen and develops a piece.
*   **...Bg4:** This pins the knight on f3 and develops a piece.

I think the most active move is to attack the queen and develop a piece. I'll go with ...Nf5.

*   **Developing moves:** I need to develop my pieces. `c7b6` and `a7b6` are pawn moves that don't seem to help much at this point.
*   **Attacking moves:** I don't have any immediate attacking moves.

I'll prioritize defense and development. The knight move `g5f6` seems like a good developing move that also helps protect the king.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Okay, I have the legal moves. White's queen is a major threat, and I need to address it. The move ...Qd4 looks interesting, attacking the queen and potentially opening lines for my pieces. However, it also leaves my knight on c6 undefended. I need to consider the consequences carefully.

Let's analyze ...Qd4. If White captures the queen with Qxd4, I can recapture with Nxd4. This would trade queens, which is good for me, and I'd still have a knight for a knight.

I think ...Qd4 is the best move in this situation. It forces a queen trade and simplifies the position, which is what I need to do to survive.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Okay, that's a lot of moves. Let's analyze them.

*   **Rook moves (a8):** Moving the rook doesn't seem to address any immediate threats.
*   **Pawn moves (h7, g7, f7, a7, g6):** Pushing the h-pawn is probably not useful. The g-pawn could open the g-file, but it's not urgent. The f-pawn could be useful to challenge the center. The a-pawn doesn't seem immediately relevant.
*   **Bishop moves (d7, e6, c7):** The bishop on d7 is blocked. The bishop on e6 has some interesting options.
*   **Knight moves (c6, h4):** The knight on c6 has a few options, but none seem immediately critical. The knight on h4 has some interesting options to attack the queen.
*   **e5f6, e5d6:** These are not legal moves.

The most interesting moves seem to be those involving the knight on h4 and the bishop on e6. The knight on h4 can attack the queen. The bishop on e6 can attack the queen.

Let's consider the knight on h4 first. Moving the knight to f6 attacks the queen and defends the g8 square. This seems like a good developing move that also creates a threat.

Therefore, I will move the knight from h4 to f6.

You are a professional chess player and you play as black. Now is your turn to make a move. Before making a move you can pick one of the following actions:
- 'get_current_board' to get the schema and current status of the board
- 'get_legal_moves' to get a UCI formatted list of available moves
- 'make_move <UCI formatted move>' when you are ready to complete your turn (e.g., 'make_move e2e4')

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, I have a good number of options. Let's analyze a bit. The most immediate threats seem to be from white's queen and bishops. I need to develop my pieces and control the center.

*   **Pawn Moves:** Moving the pawns on the h, g, d, b, and a files are all possible, but don't immediately address any threats.
*   **Knight Moves:** The knight on c6 has some interesting options. Moving it to b8, a5, d4, or b4 could be useful.
*   **Bishop Moves:** The bishop on f8 has a few options, but they don't seem particularly strong right now.
*   **Rook Moves:** Moving the rook on h8 is also possible.
*   **King Moves:** The king can move to f8 or g8.

I think developing the knight to a more active square is a good idea. Nc6-d4 looks like a good developing move, attacking the center and potentially opening lines for my queen and bishop.

Alright, I've got a good list of moves. Let's think this through. White's queen is dangerously placed, and I need to develop my pieces and challenge the center. I see a few options.

*   **...h7:** This seems like a good developing move, preparing to bring my rook into the game.
*   **...e7f6:** This develops the bishop, but it might block the pawn structure.
*   **...d7d6:** This supports the center and prepares to develop the queen.
*   **...g7g6:** This prepares to develop the bishop on the long diagonal.

I think I'll go with **...h7**. It's a solid developing move that doesn't commit me to any specific plan yet.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Okay, I have a good number of options. Let's analyze them.

*   **Pawn moves:** The pawn moves are mostly about controlling the center and developing. `e7f6` and `e7d6` look interesting, as they open lines for the bishop. Pushing the pawns on the kingside (`g7g6` or `g7g5`) is also a possibility, but I need to be careful about weakening my kingside.
*   **Bishop moves:** The bishop on f8 has a few options. `e8f8` is a passive move.
*   **Rook moves:** `a8b8` is a developing move.
*   **Other moves:** The move `d4e6` looks interesting, as it attacks the queen.

Considering the position, I think the most active move is to develop my bishop and attack the queen.

*   **e7f6** develops the bishop and attacks a white pawn. This seems like a good developing move.
*   **g7g6** prepares to develop the bishop on the long diagonal.
*   **d7d6** supports the e-pawn and prepares to develop the queen.
*   **c7c6** similar to d7d6.
*   **b7b6** prepares to develop the bishop.
*   **a7a6** doesn't seem to do much.
*   **g7g5** weakens the kingside.
*   **d7d5** challenges the center directly. This could be a good option.
*   **c7c5** challenges the center directly. This could be a good option.
*   **b7b5** challenges the center directly. This could be a good option.
*   **a7a5** doesn't seem to do much.

I think I will play **d7d5** to challenge the center.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Okay, I have the board state. Now I need to analyze the position and choose the best move.

Black's king is relatively safe for now. White has a strong center with the pawns on c3 and e4. Black's queen is well-placed, and the bishop on c8 is potentially active. The pawn structure is somewhat locked.

Considering the available moves, I see a few possibilities:

*   **Developing the bishop on c8:** Moves like ...Bd7 or ...Be7 are reasonable.
*   **Pawn moves:** ...c6 or ...b6 could help control the center.
*   **Queen moves:** ...Qd7 or ...Qd6 could improve the queen's position.
*   **Pawn push:** ...d4 could challenge white's center.

I think developing the bishop is a good starting point. ...Bd7 seems like a solid developing move.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, I have a lot of options. Let's analyze them:

*   **Queen moves (d8...):** The queen has many options, but moving it to the back rank doesn't seem to help much at this stage.
*   **Pawn moves (h7h8, e7...):** Pushing the h-pawn is not useful. The e-pawn has several options.
*   **Bishop moves (e7...):** The bishop can move to several squares, but none of them seem immediately impactful.
*   **Pawn moves (g7...):** g7-g6 or g7-g5 are possible, but don't seem to improve the position significantly.
*   **Pawn moves (c7...):** c7-c6 or c7-c5 are standard pawn moves.
*   **Pawn moves (b7...):** b7-b6 or b7-b5 are standard pawn moves.
*   **Pawn moves (a7...):** a7-a6 or a7-a5 are standard pawn moves.
*   **Pawn moves (d5...):** d5-e4, d5-c4, d5-d4. These are interesting, but could weaken the pawn structure.

Considering the position, I think the most solid move is to develop the bishop and prepare for the future. I will move the bishop to f6.

Alright, I have a list of legal moves. White's queen is a major threat, and the black king is exposed. I need to find a move that defends the king and potentially develops a counterattack.

Let's analyze some of the options:

*   **e7f8, e7e8, e7d8:** These moves involve the queen, but they don't seem to immediately address the threat.
*   **d7e8, d7d8, d7c6:** These moves involve the king, and are not good.
*   **f6g5, f6e5, e6f8, e6d8, e6g5, e6c5, e6f4, e6d4:** These knight moves are interesting, but they don't seem to solve the immediate problem.
*   **h6g5, h6h5:** These pawn moves are not helpful.
*   **d5e4, d5c4:** These pawn moves are not helpful.
*   **g7g6, c7c6, b7b6, a7a6, c7c5, b7b5, a7a5:** These pawn moves don't seem to help either.
*   **a8b8, h7h8:** These rook moves are not helpful.

The most promising move seems to be to move the queen to a safer square. **e7d6** seems like a good defensive move, protecting the king and potentially opening lines for the queen to participate in the defense.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, I've got a list of legal moves. White's attack is the priority. Let's analyze some of the key options:

*   **...Qd8:** This seems like a tempting move to develop the Queen and potentially trade it off. However, it doesn't immediately address the threats and might allow White to consolidate their attack.
*   **...Be7:** This develops the Bishop and defends the King.
*   **...Nf6:** This develops the Knight and attacks the Queen.
*   **...g6:** This prepares to develop the Bishop to g7.
*   **...h5:** This is a pawn push that might create some space.

Considering the immediate threats, I think developing the Bishop to e7 is a good defensive move.

Alright, I've got a lot of options. White's queen on d4 is a major threat. I need to consider how to defend against it and develop my pieces.

*   **Defensive moves:** `d6d7` and `d6c6` look like they could block the queen's attack, but they don't develop anything.
*   **Developing moves:** `f6e5` develops the knight, but doesn't immediately address the threat. `c8d7` develops the bishop, but it's not clear if it helps.
*   **Pawn moves:** The pawn moves don't seem to improve my position significantly.

I think the best move here is to develop the knight to e5. It attacks the queen and opens up the diagonal for the bishop.

Alright, I've got a lot of options. Let's analyze the most promising ones:

*   **...Qd7:** This develops the queen and defends the e7 pawn. It also potentially eyes the weak f7 square. This seems like a solid developing move.
*   **...e6f6:** This is a pawn move that supports the knight and opens up a diagonal for the bishop.
*   **...g7g6:** This prepares to fianchetto the bishop on g7.
*   **...c7c6:** This supports the pawn structure.

Considering the immediate threat of the white queen and the need to develop, I think ...Qd7 is the best move. It develops a piece, defends a pawn, and prepares for further development.

Looking at the moves, I see a few options. Moving the rook on a8 doesn't seem immediately helpful. Pushing the h-pawn to h5 could help create some space for the king to escape to. Moving the pawn on g7 to g6 also seems like a good idea. I'll go with g7g6 to improve the king's safety.

*   **Pawn moves:** Pushing pawns can challenge white's control of the center.
*   **Developing my knight:** The knight on c6 could be developed.
*   **Attacking the center:** I could try to challenge white's central pawns.

Considering all of the above, I think I'll start by developing my rook. I'll move the rook from a8 to d8. This opens the d-file for potential attacks and connects my rooks.

Alright, that's a lot of moves! The immediate threat is the rook on h8. I need to address that. Let's see...

*   **d8h8, d8g8, d8f8, d8e8, d8c8, d8b8, d8a8:** Moving the queen to any of these squares doesn't immediately solve the problem.
*   **d8d7:** This blocks the rook, but doesn't develop a threat.
*   **h7h8:** Promotes the pawn to a queen, but the rook on h8 is still a threat.
*   **e7f8, e7e8, e7d7, e7f6, e6f8, e6g7, e6g5, e6c5, e6f4, e6d4:** These are all bishop moves. None of them immediately help.
*   **d6d7, d6c5, d6b4, d6a3:** These are knight moves. None of them immediately help.
*   **c6e8, c6d7, c6b5, c6a4:** These are knight moves. None of them immediately help.
*   **e5h8, e5g7, e5f6, e5f4, e5d4, e5g3, e5h2:** These are bishop moves. None of them immediately help.
*   **d5e4, d5c4:** These are pawn moves. None of them immediately help.
*   **f7f6, b7b6, a7a6, h6h5, g6g5, f7f5, b7b5, a7a5:** These are pawn moves. None of them immediately help.

The best move seems to be to block the check with the queen.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, I have a lot of options. Let's consider a few.

*   **h7h8=Q, h7h8=R, h7h8=B, h7h8=N:** Promoting the pawn on h7 to a queen, rook, bishop, or knight. This is a critical decision. Promoting to a queen is usually the best, but the specific position dictates the best choice.
*   **e7f6:** Moving the pawn on e7.
*   **d6c5, d6b4, d6a3:** Moving the pawn on d6.
*   **c6b5, c6a4:** Moving the pawn on c6.
*   **e5f6, e5f4, e5d4:** Moving the bishop on e5.
*   **f7f6, f7f5:** Moving the pawn on f7.
*   **b7b6, b7b5:** Moving the pawn on b7.
*   **a7a6, a7a5:** Moving the pawn on a7.

The immediate threat is the rook on h1. I need to address that. Promoting the pawn on h7 to a queen seems like the most forcing move. It immediately attacks the rook and opens up lines for the king.

Therefore, I will promote the pawn on h7 to a queen.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, I have a lot of options. Let's analyze them.

*   **Rook moves (h8...):** Moving the rook doesn't immediately address the threats.
*   **Pawn moves (e7...):** e7f6 looks like a reasonable developing move.
*   **Pawn moves (d7...):** No good.
*   **Pawn moves (e6...):** e6f4 or e6d4 look interesting, attacking the center.
*   **Pawn moves (d6...):** Doesn't seem to help.
*   **Pawn moves (c6...):** Doesn't seem to help.
*   **Pawn moves (e5...):** Doesn't seem to help.
*   **Pawn moves (d5...):** Doesn't seem to help.
*   **Pawn moves (f7...):** f7f6 or f7f5 are possible.
*   **Pawn moves (b7...):** b7b6 or b7b5 are possible.
*   **Pawn moves (a7...):** a7a6 or a7a5 are possible.
*   **Pawn moves (h6...):** h6h5 is possible.
*   **Pawn moves (g6...):** g6g5 is possible.

Considering the position, I think I want to challenge white's control of the center. I'll play **e6f4**. This attacks the white bishop and opens the diagonal for my queen.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, that's a lot of moves. Let's analyze them.

*   **King moves:** `h8g8, h8f8, h8e8, h8d8, h8c8, h8b8, h8a8, h8h7` - Moving the king is generally a priority when under attack. However, most of these moves don't improve the king's safety and some even worsen it. `h8h7` is the most promising, as it gets the king out of the direct line of fire.
*   **Pawn moves:** `e7f8, e7e8, e7d8, f7f6, b7b6, a7a6, h6h5, g6g5, f7f5, b7b5, a7a5` - These moves are mostly defensive, trying to restrict white's pieces. `f7f6` and `f7f5` are worth considering.
*   **Bishop moves:** `d6f6, d6e6, d6c5, d6b4, d6a3` - The bishop on d6 has some potential, but none of these moves immediately address the threats.
*   **Queen moves:** `e5g7, e5f6, e5d4` - The queen is well-placed, but moving it doesn't seem to help much right now.
*   **Knight moves:** `f4e6, f4h5, f4h3, f4d3, f4g2, f4e2` - The knight on f4 is under attack. `f4e6` is the most interesting, as it attacks the white bishop.
*   **Pawn moves:** `d5e4, d5c4` - These moves don't seem to help.

Considering the threats and the need to develop, I think the best move is to move the king to h7 to get it out of the immediate danger and then develop the knight to e6 to attack the white bishop.

Alright, I have a lot of options. Let's analyze a bit.

*   **Pawn moves:** I have many pawn moves available. Pushing pawns can help control the center and potentially open lines for my pieces, but I need to be careful not to weaken my king's position.
*   **Piece moves:** I have a few piece moves. The rook on h8 and the bishop on c6 are the most active.

Considering the position, I think I should try to develop my pieces and challenge white's control of the center. The bishop on c6 seems well-placed to put pressure on the white kingside. I'll move the bishop to b5, attacking the knight on f6.

Okay, I see the board. White has a strong attack developing. My king is a bit exposed. I need to defend and develop my pieces. Let's see what moves are available.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, I have a lot of options. White is threatening to push their pawns and attack my king. I need to be careful.

*   **h7h8, h7g7, e7f8, e7e8, e7d8:** These are pawn promotions. I don't want to promote to a queen right now, as it would be immediately attacked.
*   **e7e6:** This blocks the white queen's attack on my king and prepares to develop my bishop. This seems like a good defensive move.
*   **d7d8:** Pawn promotion.
*   **d6f6, d6e6, d6c6, d6b6, d6a6, d6e5, d6c5, d6b4, d6a3:** These are knight moves.
*   **b5c6, b5a6, b5c4, b5a4:** These are pawn moves.
*   **f4e6, f4h5, f4h3, f4d3, f4g2, f4e2:** These are bishop moves.
*   **d5e4, d5c4:** These are pawn moves.
*   **f7f6, c7c6, b7b6, a7a6, h6h5, g6g5, d5d4, f7f5, c7c5, a7a5:** These are pawn moves.

Considering the threats and the need for development, I'll play **e7e6**. This blocks the queen's attack and prepares for my bishop to develop.

The move **d6e5** looks interesting. It attacks the knight on f3 and opens a line for the queen. Let's try that.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Okay, I have the legal moves. Let's analyze them. White's queen is a major threat. I need to address that.

*   **h7h8=Q:** This promotes the pawn to a queen, but it doesn't immediately solve the problem.
*   **h7g7:** Doesn't help much.
*   **d7d8=Q:** Promotes the pawn to a queen, but doesn't immediately solve the problem.
*   **d7e7, d7d6:** Doesn't help much.
*   **e6e7, e6f6, e6d6, e6e5:** These pawn moves don't seem to help.
*   **f4h5, f4h3, f4d3, f4g2, f4e2:** These moves with the pawn don't seem to help.
*   **e4f5, e4e5, e4d4, e4c4, e4b4, e4a4, e4f3, e4e3, e4d3, e4g2, e4c2, e4h1, e4b1:** These moves with the pawn don't seem to help.
*   **f7f6, c7c6, b7b6, a7a6, h6h5, g6g5, d5d4, f7f5, c7c5, a7a5:** These pawn moves don't seem to help.

The most important thing is to defend against the queen. I see that I can move my pawn to defend the king.

I think the best move is to move the pawn on f7 to f6, blocking the queen's attack and also opening up the possibility of developing the rook on h8.

*   **Knight moves:** The knight on f4 is a threat. I need to consider how to deal with it.
*   **King safety:** My king is a bit exposed. I need to think about how to improve its safety.

Let's analyze some of the pawn moves. Pushing the h-pawn to h5 seems like a reasonable move to challenge white's control of the h-file and potentially create some space.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, that's a lot of moves. Let's analyze them.

*   **Pawn moves:** I have several pawn moves. `h7h8` promotes a pawn, but it's not immediately helpful. `d7d8` is similar. The other pawn moves are mostly defensive or developing.
*   **e6 moves:** The pawn on e6 can move to several squares.
*   **f4 moves:** The knight on f4 has a few options.
*   **e4 moves:** The pawn on e4 has a lot of options.
*   **h5 moves:** The pawn on h5 has a few options.
*   **c7, b7, a7, g6, f6, d5 moves:** These are pawn moves.

Considering the position, I need to be careful. White's queen and knight are well-placed. I think the most pressing issue is the potential threat to my king. I need to develop a piece to help defend.

I'm going to move my pawn to e5 to challenge the center and open up lines for my pieces.

Alright, I've got a lot of options. White's attack is the priority. I need to find a move that addresses the immediate threats and develops a piece.

*   **h7h6:** This seems like a passive move, not really helping.
*   **e6f7:** This is a bad move, it allows the white queen to capture my pawn.
*   **e5e4:** This looks interesting. It attacks the white queen and opens up a line for my dark-squared bishop.

I think **e5e4** is the best move here. It forces White to react, develops a piece, and potentially disrupts their attack.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, I have a lot of options. White's queen and knight are targeting my king. I need to find a move that defends against the immediate threats and possibly develops a counterattack.

Let's analyze some of the moves:

*   **Pawn moves:** Moving pawns like h7h6, h7g7, d7d6, etc., don't seem to help much against the immediate threats.
*   **e6 moves:** e6f7, e6e7, e6d6, e6e5, are all possible, but don't seem to address the main issue.
*   **f4 moves:** f4h3, f4d3, f4g2, f4e2, are all possible, but don't seem to address the main issue.
*   **e4 moves:** e4f5, e4e5, e4d4, e4c4, e4b4, e4a4, e4f3, e4e3, e4d3, e4g2, e4e2, e4c2, e4e1, e4b1, are all possible, but don't seem to address the main issue.
*   **h5g4:** This doesn't seem to help.
*   **c7c6, b7b6, a7a6, g6g5, f6f5, d5d4, c7c5, a7a5:** These are all pawn moves that don't seem to address the immediate threats.

The most pressing threat is the queen on e5. I need to find a move that defends against it.

I see that if I move my pawn from e6 to e5, it will block the queen's attack on my king.

Therefore, I will make the move e6e5.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, that's a lot of moves. White's queen is a major threat. I need to find a move that addresses the immediate danger and hopefully develops a counterattack.

Let's analyze a few options:

*   **h7h6, h7h5:** These pawn moves don't seem to help much.
*   **d7d6, d7d8:** Pushing the pawn to d6 doesn't seem to help. Promoting the pawn to a queen (d7d8) could be interesting, but it's a long shot.
*   **e5e6, e5d6, e5f5, e5d4:** These are all pawn moves. None of them seem to address the immediate threat.
*   **f4e6, f4h5, f4h3, f4d3, f4g2, f4e2:** These are all knight moves. The knight on f6 is well-placed to defend the king.
*   **e4f5, e4d4, e4c4, e4b4, e4a4, e4f3, e4e3, e4d3, e4g2, e4e2, e4c2, e4e1, e4b1:** These are all queen moves. The Queen on d5 is the biggest threat.
*   **g6h5:** This pawn move doesn't seem to help.
*   **c7c6, b7b6, a7a6, g6g5, f6f5, d5d4, c7c5, a7a5:** These are all pawn moves.

The best move seems to be to defend the king with the knight.

I'll move the knight to e8.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, I have a good selection of moves. Let's consider a few options.

*   **Developing a Knight:** `g8f6` and `g8h6` are both standard developing moves. `g8f6` is the more common and arguably better move, controlling central squares.
*   **Pawn Moves:** Pushing pawns like `h7h6`, `g7g6`, etc., are fine, but don't immediately develop a piece or challenge white's control of the center.
*   **Other Knight moves:** `b8c6` and `b8a6` are also developing moves, but less common in this opening position.

I think developing the knight to f6 is the most principled move. It controls central squares and prepares for further development.

You are a professional chess player and you play as black. Now is your turn to make a move. Before making a move you can pick one of the following actions:
- 'get_current_board' to get the schema and current status of the board
- 'get_legal_moves' to get a UCI formatted list of available moves

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, I have a list of legal moves. Let's analyze the position. White has developed their pieces and has a solid pawn structure. Black needs to develop and challenge the center.

I see a few options. Pushing the h-pawn or g-pawn doesn't seem immediately useful. Developing the knight on c6 looks good, but I'll hold off on that for now. I think the most active move is to develop the f6 knight. I can move it to either g8, h5, d5, g4, or e4.

*   **f6g8:** This develops the knight, but doesn't immediately challenge anything.
*   **f6h5:** This attacks the g7 pawn, but white can easily defend.
*   **f6d5:** This attacks the center and opens lines for the queen and bishop. This seems like a good developing move.
*   **f6g4:** This attacks the f2 pawn, but it's not a major threat.
*   **f6e4:** This attacks the center and opens lines for the queen and bishop. This seems like a good developing move.

Between f6d5 and f6e4, I prefer f6d5. It directly challenges the center and prepares to develop the queen and bishop.

So, I will move the knight from f6 to d5.

Alright, I have a good number of options. Let's consider a few.

*   **...h7-h6 or ...h7-h5:** These are standard pawn moves, but they don't immediately develop any pieces or challenge white's control of the center.
*   **...g7-g6 or ...g7-g5:** Similar to the h-pawn moves, these are somewhat passive.
*   **...f7-f6 or ...f7-f5:** These moves could be useful for controlling the center, but they also weaken the e6 square.
*   **...e7-e6 or ...e7-e5:** ...e7-e5 is a more active move, challenging white's control of the center. ...e7-e6 is more solid, but less dynamic.
*   **...d7-d6 or ...d7-d5:** ...d7-d5 is a strong move, directly contesting the center.
*   **...b7-b6 or ...b7-b5:** These are standard pawn moves, but don't immediately develop any pieces or challenge white's control of the center.
*   **...a7-a6 or ...a7-a5:** These are standard pawn moves, but don't immediately develop any pieces or challenge white's control of the center.
*   **...c6-b8, ...c6-e5, ...c6-a5, ...c6-d4, ...c6-b4:** These are knight moves. ...Nc6-e5 looks interesting, developing the knight to a central square and attacking the pawn on d3.
*   **...d5-f6, ...d5-b6, ...d5-f4, ...d5-b4, ...d5-e3, ...d5-c3:** These are queen moves.

Considering the position, I think the most active and promising move is to develop my knight to a central square and challenge white's control of the center.

I'll play ...Nc6-e5.

I think I'll start by developing my knight. I'll move the knight from g8 to f6. This controls some central squares and prepares for further development.

Alright, I have the list of legal moves. The position is relatively open, and White has advanced their e-pawn. I see a few options.

*   **Developing the Knights:** ...Nf6 (g8f6) is a standard developing move, controlling central squares. ...Nc6 (b8c6) is also good, preparing to challenge the center.
*   **Developing the Bishop:** ...Be7 (f8e7) is a solid developing move.
*   **Pawn Advances:** ...h6, ...g6, ...f6, ...d6, ...c6, ...b6, ...a6 are all possible, but I want to be more active.
*   **Aggressive Pawn Advances:** ...h5, ...g5, ...f5, ...d5, ...c5, ...b5, ...a5 are more aggressive, but could leave weaknesses.

Considering the position, I think developing the knight to f6 is a solid and flexible choice. It controls important central squares and prepares for further development.

You are a professional chess player and you play as black. Now is your turn to make a move. Before making a move you can pick one of the following actions:
- 'get_current_board' to get the schema and current status of the board
- 'get_legal_moves' to get a UCI formatted list of available moves
- 'make_move <UCI formatted move>' when you are ready to complete your turn (e.g., 'make_move e2e4')

Okay, I'm ready to analyze the position and make a move. First, let's get the current board state.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, I have a good number of options. White's queen on g5 is a threat, so I need to address that. Let's look at a few possibilities:

*   **...Bg4:** This attacks the queen directly.
*   **...Qe7:** Develops the queen and prepares to defend.
*   **...Nf6:** Develops the knight, but doesn't immediately address the queen.

I think attacking the queen is the most active response. Let's go with ...Bg4.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Okay, I have a lot of options. Let's analyze them.

*   **Pawn moves:** Pushing pawns like h7h6, g7g6, c7c6, b7b6, a7a6, h7h5, g7g5, c7c5, b7b5, a7a5 are all reasonable to control the center and prepare for development.
*   **Knight moves:** The knight on f6 has several options. Developing it to e4 (f6e4) seems interesting, attacking the center.
*   **Bishop moves:** The bishop on f8 has several long-range options.
*   **Queen moves:** The queen on d8 has several long-range options.
*   **King moves:** The king on e8 has a few moves to consider.

I like the idea of developing the knight to e4. It attacks the center and forces White to react.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

That's a lot of options! Let's analyze. White has a strong pawn structure in the center. I need to develop my pieces and challenge that. The queen on d8 has a lot of potential, but I don't want to move it too early. The knight on b8 has limited options at the moment. The bishop on f8 is a key piece.

I think the best move is to develop the bishop to e7. It controls important diagonals and prepares for future attacks.

*   **Pawn moves:** I have a lot of pawn moves available. Pushing pawns is often a good way to control the center and develop my position.
*   **Knight moves:** The knight on b8 has several options, but developing it to c6 seems like a good developing move. The knight on e4 has a lot of options too.
*   **Queen moves:** The queen on d8 has several options, but it's not clear where the best square is yet.
*   **King moves:** The king has limited options.
*   **Bishop moves:** The bishop on f8 has a few options.

Considering the position, I think developing the knight to c6 is a solid developing move. It controls central squares and prepares for further development.

*   **...e7d6:** This opens the diagonal for my dark-squared bishop and challenges white's pawn on d4. It also supports a potential ...c5 break later.
*   **...e7f6:** This develops the knight and attacks the pawn on e4.
*   **...g7g6:** This supports the knight on g4, and prepares to fianchetto the bishop on g7.
*   **...h7h6:** This prevents a potential white knight jump to g5.
*   **...d8d6:** This develops the queen and attacks the pawn on d4.

I like the idea of developing my queen and attacking the center. I'll go with ...Qd6.

Alright, I have the legal moves. The position is relatively open, and I need to develop my pieces and control the center. I see a few options.

*   **...h7-h6** and **...g7-g6** are standard pawn moves to support the development of my pieces.
*   **...b8-c6** develops the knight and controls central squares.
*   **...e7-d6** is a solid developing move for the bishop.
*   **...e7-f8** is also a developing move for the bishop.

I think developing the knight to c6 is a good, active move. It challenges the center and prepares for further development.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Okay, I have a lot of options. The queen on g5 is definitely a concern. Let's evaluate some of the moves.

*   **Defensive moves:** h7h6, g7g6, d7d6, b7b6, a7a6, h7h5, g7g5, d7d5, b7b5, a7a5. These are all pawn moves that don't immediately address the queen.
*   **Bishop moves:** e7f8, e7d6, e7c5, e7b4, e7a3. Moving the bishop could be useful. e7d6 looks interesting, as it develops the bishop and potentially blocks the queen's diagonal.
*   **Knight moves:** c6b8, c6e5, c6a5, c6d4, c6b4. The knight on c6 has a few options. c6e5 attacks the queen, which is good.
*   **Rook moves:** h8g8, h8f8, a8b8. These moves don't seem immediately relevant.
*   **King moves:** e8f8, e8g8. These moves don't seem immediately relevant.
*   **Pawn moves:** e6e5. This move opens the position, but it doesn't address the immediate threat.

**Analysis:**

The most pressing issue is the white queen on g5. The best moves seem to be either to attack the queen or to block its diagonal.

*   **c6e5:** This is a direct attack on the queen. White will have to move the queen, giving me time to develop.
*   **e7d6:** This blocks the queen's diagonal and develops the bishop.

I think attacking the queen is the best option.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, I have a lot of options. White's queen on g5 is a bit of a threat, so I need to be careful. Let's consider a few moves:

*   **...h7h6:** This seems like a solid, prophylactic move, preventing any potential back-rank issues.
*   **...g7g6:** This supports the knight on g8 and prepares for a potential ...Bg7 development.
*   **...e7e6:** This would block the queen's diagonal and prepare for the development of the dark-squared bishop.
*   **...d7d6:** This supports the e5 pawn and prepares the development of the dark-squared bishop.
*   **...Nf6:** Developing the knight to f6 is a standard developing move, attacking the center.

Considering the position, I think developing the knight to f6 is the most active and principled move. It challenges white's control of the center and prepares for further development.

*   **e5g6, e5c6, e5g4, e5c4, e5f3, e5d3:** These are all pawn moves, and while they can develop the bishop, they don't address the immediate threat.
*   **h7h6, f7f6, d7d6, c7c6, b7b6, a7a6, h7h5, f7f5, d7d5, c7c5, b7b5, a7a5:** These are all pawn moves, and while they can develop the bishop, they don't address the immediate threat.

The best move here seems to be to develop the knight to f6, challenging the queen and preparing to defend the king.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, I've got the legal moves. White's attack is a serious threat. I need to develop and try to create some counterplay.

*   **h7h6** is a solid move, preventing a potential back-rank mate.
*   **d7d6** is also a good developing move.
*   **e7d6** looks interesting, developing the bishop and potentially opening the diagonal for the queen.
*   **e7c5** is another option for the bishop.
*   **h7h5** is a more aggressive move, but might weaken the kingside.

I think I'll go with **d7d6**. It develops a piece, supports the pawn structure, and doesn't weaken anything immediately. It's a solid, developing move in a critical situation.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, I've got a lot of options. White's queen is a threat, and I need to address that. Let's consider the possibilities:

*   **Developing the Bishop:** `c8d7` looks interesting, developing the bishop and potentially eyeing the weakened f7 square.
*   **King safety:** `e8d7` is a possibility, but it doesn't immediately address the threat.
*   **Pawn moves:** `h7h6` or `h7h5` seem passive. `c7c6` or `c7c5` are also possibilities.
*   **Knight moves:** `f6d7` seems like a good developing move.

Considering the position, I think developing the bishop to d7 is a good developing move that also helps defend against potential attacks.

Okay, I see my available moves are g7g8, g7h6, and g7g6.

*   **g7g8:** This promotes the pawn to a queen. This is tempting, but it might create a target for white's pieces.
*   **g7h6:** This is a developing move, pushing the pawn and potentially opening a line for the king to escape.
*   **g7g6:** This is a more conservative move, controlling the g6 square and preventing white from advancing their pawns.

Given the position, I think the most solid move is to develop the pawn and prepare for possible king safety.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, I've got a lot of options. Let's break this down.

*   **Queen moves (h8, d8):** The queen has a lot of potential moves, but I need to be careful not to expose her.
*   **Rook moves (a8):** The rook on a8 has limited options.
*   **Bishop moves (f8):** The bishop on f8 has limited options.
*   **Knight moves (h6, f6):** The knights have some interesting possibilities.
*   **Pawn moves (b7, a7, d6, c6):** Pawn moves are important for controlling the center and developing my position.

I'm leaning towards developing a piece and controlling the center. The move ...d6-d5 looks promising, challenging white's central pawn structure.

Okay, I see the board. Black's king is currently exposed. White has a strong attack developing. I need to find a move that addresses the immediate threats and improves my position. Let's get a list of legal moves.

h8g8,h8f8,h8e8,d8g8,d8f8,d8e8,d8c8,d8b8,d8c7,d8b6,d8a5,a8c8,a8b8,e7f8,e7d6,e7c5,e7b4,e7a3,d7e8,d7c8,h6g7,h6g6,h6h5,f6g8,f6e8,f6h5,f6g4,f6e4,e5g6,e5g4,e5c4,e5f3,e5d3,d5e4,b7b6,a7a6,c6c5,b7b5,a7a5

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, I've got a lot of moves to consider. White is clearly trying to put pressure on my king. I need to prioritize defense.

*   **h8g8, h8f8, h8e8:** Moving the rook doesn't seem to help much immediately.
*   **d8g8, d8f8, d8e8, d8c8, d8b8, d8c7, d8b6, d8a5:** Moving the queen is tempting, but it could be easily attacked.
*   **a8c8, a8b8:** Moving the rook doesn't seem to help much immediately.
*   **e7f8, e7d6, e7c5, e7b4, e7a3:** Moving the bishop doesn't seem to help much immediately.
*   **d7e8, d7c8:** Moving the pawn doesn't seem to help much immediately.
*   **h6g7, h6g6, h6h5:** Moving the knight doesn't seem to help much immediately.
*   **f6g8, f6e8, f6h5, f6g4, f6e4:** Moving the knight doesn't seem to help much immediately.
*   **e5g6, e5g4, e5c4, e5f3, e5d3:** Moving the pawn doesn't seem to help much immediately.
*   **d5e4:** Moving the pawn doesn't seem to help much immediately.
*   **b7b6, a7a6, c6c5, b7b5, a7a5:** These pawn moves are not immediately helpful.

I think the best move here is to move the queen to a safer square, while still keeping an eye on the center. **d8c7** looks like a good option. It develops the queen, gets it out of the immediate line of fire, and prepares to defend the king.

Okay, I have a lot of options. The queen moves are important to consider first.

*   **h8g8, h8f8, h8e8, h8d8, h8c8, h8b8:** These moves move the rook along the back rank. Not immediately helpful.

*   **d7e8, d7c8:** These moves move the queen to the back rank. Not immediately helpful.
*   **c7d8, c7c8, c7b8:** These moves move the queen to the back rank. Not immediately helpful.
*   **c7d6, c7b6, c7a5:** These moves look interesting, but they don't immediately address the threat.
*   **h6g7, h6g6, h6h5:** These moves move the pawn. Not immediately helpful.
*   **f6g8, f6e8, f6h5, f6g4, f6e4:** These moves move the knight. Not immediately helpful.
*   **e5g6, e5g4, e5c4, e5f3, e5d3:** These moves move the knight. Not immediately helpful.
*   **d5e4:** This move moves the pawn. Not immediately helpful.
*   **b7b6, a7a6, c6c5, b7b5, a7a5:** These moves move the pawns. Not immediately helpful.

The queen is under pressure, and I need to find a safe square for her. I think the best move is to move the queen to a safe square. **e7d6** looks like a good option, as it develops the queen to a more active square and gets her out of the line of fire.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Okay, I have a lot of options. The most important thing is to get my king out of check. The rook on h8 can move to g8, f8, e8, d8, c8, or b8. The queen on c7 can move to d8, c8, b8, b6, a5. The pawn on h6 can move to g7, g6, h5. The knight on f6 can move to g8, e8, h5, g4, e4. The bishop on d6 can move to f8, e7, c5, b4, a3. The pawn on e5 can move to g6, g4, c4, f3, d3. The pawn on d5 can move to e4. The pawn on b7 can move to b6, b5. The pawn on a7 can move to a6, a5. The pawn on c6 can move to c5.

Moving the rook to g8, f8, e8, d8, c8, or b8 doesn't block the check. Moving the queen to d8, c8, b8, b6, a5 doesn't block the check. Moving the pawn on h6 doesn't block the check. Moving the knight on f6 to g8, e8, h5, g4, e4 doesn't block the check. Moving the bishop on d6 to f8, e7, c5, b4, a3 doesn't block the check. Moving the pawn on e5 to g6, g4, c4, f3, d3 doesn't block the check. Moving the pawn on d5 to e4 doesn't block the check. Moving the pawn on b7 to b6 or b5 doesn't block the check. Moving the pawn on a7 to a6 or a5 doesn't block the check. Moving the pawn on c6 to c5 doesn't block the check.

However, the king can move to g8.

Alright, I have a list of possible moves. Let's consider the options.

*   **Pawn moves:** Pushing pawns is generally a good idea in the opening to control the center and develop pieces. I see a lot of pawn moves available.
*   **Knight moves:** The knight on f6 has several options.

I think developing the knight is a good idea. I'll move the knight to d5, controlling the center.

You are a professional chess player and you play as black. Now is your turn to make a move. Before making a move you can pick one of the following actions:
- 'get_current_board' to get the schema and current status of the board
- 'get_legal_moves' to get a UCI formatted list of available moves
- 'make_move <UCI formatted move>' when you are ready to complete your turn (e.g., 'make_move e2e4')

Alright, I have the legal moves. Let's analyze. Black has a few options here. I see a few pawn moves that control the center, and some developing moves with the bishop and rook.

I think the best move here is to develop the bishop to e5, attacking the knight on f3 and controlling the center.

I think pushing the e-pawn is a good developing move. It opens up the diagonal for my queen and bishop, and it challenges white's control of the center.

So, I will move e7-e6.

Alright, I have a good list of moves. Let's analyze. The position is relatively open. White has developed their pieces a bit more. I need to develop my pieces and control the center.

My options for the queen are good, but I don't want to develop it too early. Moving the bishop on f8 is a good option. I can develop it to e7, controlling the long diagonal. I could also develop it to d6, controlling the center.

I think developing the bishop to e7 is the most solid move. It prepares for castling and doesn't overextend.

Alright, I have a lot of options. Let's consider a few.

*   **Developing the Queen's Bishop:** Moving the bishop on f6 seems like a good idea to develop a piece. f6e7 doesn't seem to do much. f6g5 attacks the knight and opens up the diagonal. f6h4 is a bit too aggressive.
*   **Pawn Moves:** Pushing the pawns on the kingside (g7g6, h6h5) could be useful for controlling space, but I don't want to weaken my kingside too early.
*   **Other Moves:** e8e7 seems like a passive move.

I think developing the bishop to g5 is a good developing move that also puts some pressure on the knight.

Okay, that's a lot of moves. Let's analyze. The queen on f6 is a threat, but I have a few options to deal with it. I could move the king, but that seems passive. I could move the pawn on g7 to g6, but that doesn't address the immediate threat. I could move the pawn on e5 to block the queen, but that might not be the best long-term strategy.

I think the best move here is to develop the bishop on c8. It attacks the queen and opens up the diagonal for the queen.

Alright, I have a lot of options. White's queen is a serious threat. I need to prioritize defending my king and developing my pieces.

*   **h8g8, h8f8, h8h7, e8f8, e8e7, d8e7, d8f6, a8b8:** These are all moves with my rooks and queen. Some of them may be useful later, but they don't address the immediate threat.
*   **g5e7, g5f6, g5h4, g5f4:** These are moves with my knight. The knight on g5 is defending the king, so moving it would be risky.
*   **e5g6, e5c6, e5g4, e5c4, e5f3, e5d3:** These are moves with my pawn on e5. These are all bad moves, as they open up the position for white.
*   **e8g8:** This is a king move. It's a good idea to move the king to safety.
*   **e6d5, g7g6, d7d6, c7c6, b7b6, a7a6, c7c5, b7b5, a7a5:** These are pawn moves. Some of these might be useful in the long run, but don't address the immediate threat.

The best move here is to move my king to safety.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, I have a lot of options. White's Queen on g3 is a major threat, and I need to address it. Let's analyze the moves:

*   **Pawn moves:** Pushing pawns like f7f6, d7d6, c7c6, b7b6, a7a6, h6h5, f7f5, c7c5, b7b5, a7a5 don't seem to directly address the threat and might weaken my position further.
*   **e7 moves:** e7e8, e7d8, e7f6, e7d6, e7c5, e7b4 are all related to the Queen. e7f6 seems like a reasonable move to develop the Queen and defend against the threat.
*   **g5 moves:** g5f6, g5h4, g5f4 are all related to the Knight. g5f6 seems like a reasonable move to develop the Knight and defend against the threat.
*   **e5 moves:** e5g6, e5c6, e5g4, e5c4, e5f3, e5d3 are all related to the Queen.
*   **Rook moves:** a8b8, g8h8, f8e8, f8d8 are all related to the Rook.

Considering the immediate threat and development, I think **Nf6** is the best move. It develops the knight, defends the pawn on e7, and prepares for further development.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, I have a lot of options. The most pressing issue is the attack on my King. I need to consider how to best defend.

*   **Defensive Moves:** `e7d6`, `e7c5`, `e7b4` look like they might help block the Queen's attack. `f6g5` and `f6h4` are also possibilities to develop the knight and potentially defend.
*   **Development Moves:** `f6g5`, `f6h4` are good for developing the knight.
*   **Pawn Moves:** `d7d6`, `c7c6`, `b7b6`, `a7a6`, `h6h5`, `c7c5`, `b7b5`, `a7a5` are all pawn moves that don't immediately address the threat.

Considering the immediate threat, I think the best move is to develop my knight to g5, blocking the Queen's diagonal and potentially creating counterplay.

Alright, I've got a lot of options. White's queen is a major threat, and I need to find a way to deal with it. Let's analyze some of these moves:

*   **f6e7**: This develops the knight, but doesn't immediately address the queen.
*   **f6g6**: This also develops the knight, but it's a bit passive.
*   **f6f5**: This challenges the center, but it might open up lines for the white queen.
*   **e5c6**: This develops the knight and attacks the queen. This seems like a good option.

Let's try e5c6.

Okay, I have the legal moves. The queen can move to several squares. Moving the queen to f6 is not a good option since it is still under attack. Let's see...

*   **h8g8:** This moves the rook, which doesn't address the immediate threat to the queen.
*   **h8h7:** This moves the rook, which doesn't address the immediate threat to the queen.
*   **f8g8:** This moves the bishop, which doesn't address the immediate threat to the queen.
*   **f8e8:** This moves the bishop, which doesn't address the immediate threat to the queen.
*   **a8b8:** This moves the rook, which doesn't address the immediate threat to the queen.
*   **f6d8:** This moves the knight, which doesn't address the immediate threat to the queen.
*   **f6f7:** This moves the knight, which doesn't address the immediate threat to the queen.
*   **f6e7:** This moves the knight, which doesn't address the immediate threat to the queen.
*   **f6g6:** This moves the knight, which doesn't address the immediate threat to the queen.
*   **f6g5:** This moves the knight, which doesn't address the immediate threat to the queen.
*   **f6f5:** This moves the knight, which doesn't address the immediate threat to the queen.
*   **f6e5:** This moves the knight, which doesn't address the immediate threat to the queen.
*   **f6f4:** This moves the knight, which doesn't address the immediate threat to the queen.
*   **f6d4:** This moves the knight, which doesn't address the immediate threat to the queen.
*   **f6c3:** This moves the knight, which doesn't address the immediate threat to the queen.
*   **f6b2:** This moves the knight, which doesn't address the immediate threat to the queen.
*   **f6a1:** This moves the knight, which doesn't address the immediate threat to the queen.
*   **c6d8:** This moves the knight, which doesn't address the immediate threat to the queen.
*   **c6b8:** This moves the knight, which doesn't address the immediate threat to the queen.
*   **c6e7:** This moves the knight, which doesn't address the immediate threat to the queen.
*   **c6e5:** This moves the knight, which doesn't address the immediate threat to the queen.
*   **c6a5:** This moves the knight, which doesn't address the immediate threat to the queen.
*   **c6d4:** This moves the knight, which doesn't address the immediate threat to the queen.
*   **c6b4:** This moves the knight, which doesn't address the immediate threat to the queen.
*   **h6g5:** This moves the pawn, which doesn't address the immediate threat to the queen.
*   **e6d5:** This moves the pawn, which doesn't address the immediate threat to the queen.
*   **g7g6:** This moves the pawn, which doesn't address the immediate threat to the queen.
*   **d7d6:** This moves the pawn, which doesn't address the immediate threat to the queen.
*   **b7b6:** This moves the pawn, which doesn't address the immediate threat to the queen.
*   **a7a6:** This moves the pawn, which doesn't address the immediate threat to the queen.
*   **h6h5:** This moves the pawn, which doesn't address the immediate threat to the queen.
*   **e6e5:** This moves the pawn, which doesn't address the immediate threat to the queen.
*   **b7b5:** This moves the pawn, which doesn't address the immediate threat to the queen.
*   **a7a5:** This moves the pawn, which doesn't address the immediate threat to the queen.

The best move is to move the queen to a safe square. The queen can move to e8.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, I've got a lot of options. White's attack is the priority. Let's examine the possibilities:

*   **Defensive moves:** `h8g8, h8h7, f8g8, f8e8, a8b8`: These moves with the rooks and queen don't seem to address the immediate threat.
*   **Pawn moves:** `g7g6, d7d6, b7b6, a7a6, h6h5, e6e5, b7b5, a7a5`: These moves are mostly passive and don't help much.
*   **Knight moves:** `c6d8, c6b8, c6e5, c6a5, c6d4, c6b4`: The knight is the key piece to defend, and moving it is important.

I think the knight needs to move to defend the king. `c6e5` looks like a good move, attacking the white knight and potentially opening lines for the queen.

*   **e7e8, e7d8:** Moving the queen doesn't seem to help.
*   **e7f7, e7f6, e7d6, e7g5, e7c5, e7b4:** These queen moves look interesting. Qf6 seems to be a good developing move, and it defends the e-file.
*   **e5f7, e5g6, e5c6, e5g4, e5c4, e5f3, e5d3:** These knight moves don't seem to help.
*   **h6g5, g7g6, d7d6, c7c6, b7b6, a7a6, h6h5, d7d5, c7c5, b7b5, a7a5:** These pawn moves are mostly passive.

**My plan:** I'll move the queen to f6 to defend the e-file, develop a piece, and prepare for potential counterplay.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, I have a list of legal moves. White's attack is a serious threat. I need to prioritize defense, but also look for opportunities to create counterplay.

Let's analyze some key moves:

*   **h8g8**: Moving the rook to g8 doesn't seem to help much.
*   **h8h7**: This blocks the h-file, but doesn't address the immediate threats.
*   **f6e7**: This seems like a good move to develop the knight and defend the king.
*   **g7g6**: This supports the knight and prepares to move the pawn to g5 to challenge white's attack.
*   **d7d6**: This blocks the diagonal of the white queen.
*   **e5f7**: This seems like a bad move because it blocks the knight.
*   **h6g5**: This is a good move to challenge white's attack.

Considering the position, I think the best move is to develop the knight and defend the king.

*   **h8h7:** This is a passive move, just delaying the inevitable.
*   **f8g8, f8e8, a8b8:** These don't seem to help much.
*   **e7e8, e7d8:** These are not good.
*   **e7f7, e7f6, e7d6, e7g5, e7c5, e7b4:** These are all interesting pawn moves.
*   **e5f7, e5g6, e5c6, e5g4, e5c4, e5f3, e5d3:** These are knight moves.
*   **h6g5, g7g6, d7d6, c7c6, b7b6, a7a6, h6h5, d7d5, c7c5, b7b5, a7a5:** These are pawn moves.

The most pressing threat is the Queen on e7. I need to find a way to defend. I think I will play **e7f6**. This blocks the Queen's attack on the King and opens a line for the Bishop.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, I have a lot of options. White's Queen on f2 is a major threat. I need to consider that.

*   **h8h7:** Doesn't really help.
*   **f8g8, f8e8, f8d8, f8f7:** Moving the Rook doesn't seem to address the immediate threat.
*   **a8b8:** Doesn't help.
*   **f6d8, f6f7, f6e7, f6g6, f6g5, f6f5, f6f4, f6f3, f6f2:** The Knight moves are interesting. f6f2 would be a check, but the Queen can recapture. f6g4 looks interesting, attacking the pawn on h2.
*   **e5f7, e5g6, e5c6, e5g4, e5c4, e5f3, e5d3:** The Queen moves are also interesting. e5g4 attacks the pawn on h2, but the Queen is exposed.
*   **h6g5, g7g6, d7d6, c7c6, b7b6, a7a6, h6h5, d7d5, c7c5, b7b5, a7a5:** Pawn moves don't seem to help much.

I think the best move here is to develop my Knight and attack the pawn on h2. This forces White to react and potentially opens up some lines for my pieces.

Alright, I have a lot of options. White has pushed their e-pawn, so I need to react. I see several possibilities.

*   **...Nf6:** This is a standard developing move, controlling central squares.
*   **...e6:** This supports the d5 square and prepares to develop the light-squared bishop.
*   **...d5:** This challenges white in the center.

I think ...Nf6 is a solid and flexible move. Let's go with that.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, I have the list of legal moves. Let's analyze them.

*   **Pawn moves:** The pawn moves are standard and don't immediately create any tactical opportunities. Pushing the pawns on the kingside or queenside is a common strategy in the opening.
*   **Knight moves:** The knight on f6 has several options. Moving it to g8 or h5 doesn't seem to accomplish much. Moving it to d5 looks interesting, as it attacks the center. Moving it to e4 or g4 is also possible.
*   **Bishop moves:** The bishop on f8 has several options. Moving it to e7, d6, or c5 could develop the bishop, but it's blocked by pawns.
*   **King moves:** The king can move to e7.

Considering the position, I think developing the knight to the center is a good idea.

I'll move the knight from f6 to d5.

Alright, I have a good list of moves to consider. The position is complex. White has a strong queen and a knight that is potentially well-placed. Black's pieces are a bit more passive at the moment. I need to develop my pieces and challenge white's control of the center.

I'll start by developing my bishop. Moving the bishop to e7 looks like a good developing move, controlling important squares and preparing for potential attacks.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, I have a lot of options. Let's analyze them.

*   **King moves:** `e8f8`, `e8d8`, `e8g8` - Moving the King is generally not a good idea unless forced.
*   **Rook moves:** `h8g8`, `h8f8`, `a8b8` - The rooks are currently blocked.
*   **Queen moves:** `f6h6`, `f6g6`, `f6e6`, `f6d6`, `f6g5`, `f6f5`, `f6h4`, `f6f4` - The Queen has a lot of options, but many of them don't immediately develop a threat or improve my position.
*   **Bishop moves:** `e7f8`, `e7d8`, `e7d6`, `e7c5`, `e7b4`, `e7a3` - The Bishop on e7 has some interesting diagonal options.
*   **Knight moves:** `c6d8`, `c6b8`, `c6a5`, `c6d4`, `c6b4` - The Knight on c6 has some options, but none seem particularly strong right now.
*   **Pawn moves:** `h7h6`, `g7g6`, `d7d6`, `b7b6`, `a7a6`, `h7h5`, `g7g5`, `b7b5`, `a7a5` - Pawn moves are generally for controlling space or supporting pieces.

Considering the position, I want to develop my pieces and control the center. The Bishop on e7 looks like a good piece to develop. I will move the Bishop to d6, controlling the important e5 square and potentially putting pressure on the white pawn structure.

You are a professional chess player and you play as black. Now is your turn to make a move. Before making a move you can pick one of the following actions:
- 'get_current_board' to get the schema and current status of the board
- 'get_legal_moves' to get a UCI formatted list of available moves
- 'make_move <UCI formatted move>' when you are ready to complete your turn (e.g., 'make_move e2e4')

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Okay, I have a lot of options. Let's analyze a bit.

*   **King Safety:** Moving the king to e7 or f8 might be considered, but it doesn't immediately improve the position and could further restrict the king.
*   **Development:** Developing the knight on f6 is a good idea. Nf6-e7 seems passive. Nf6-g8 doesn't help much. Nf6-h4 looks interesting, attacking the pawn on g2, but it's a bit premature.
*   **Pawn Structure:** Pushing pawns on the kingside (h7-h6, g7-g6) is a standard approach to create space and potentially prepare for a kingside attack later. However, it's not urgent right now.
*   **Queen:** The queen on d6 is well-placed.
*   **Other pieces:** The rooks are passive. The bishops are blocked.

Considering the position, I think developing the knight to g6 is a good developing move, preparing to challenge the center and potentially support a kingside attack later.

Okay, I have the list of legal moves. Let's analyze the position. Black's king is somewhat exposed, and White has a strong attack potential. I need to be careful.

The move ...h7h6 looks like a good prophylactic move to prevent a potential attack on the h-file. It also prepares for ...g5, which could open the h-file for Black's rook.

Therefore, I will play h7h6.

Alright, I have a lot of options. White's attack is a real threat. I need to defend and develop. Let's analyze some of the key moves:

*   **...h7:** This seems like a reasonable defensive move to protect the rook.
*   **...f6:** This supports the pawn structure and prevents White from easily advancing their pawns.
*   **...e7:** This opens up the diagonal for the Bishop and allows the King to escape if needed.
*   **...Qf6:** This move defends the pawn on f7 and develops the Queen.

Considering the position, I think the best move is to develop the Queen to defend the f7 pawn and control the center.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, I've got a lot of options. Let's analyze the most critical ones:

*   **h8g8, h8f8, h8h7:** Moving the rook doesn't seem to help much immediately.
*   **e8f8, e8d8, e8e7:** King moves are risky, given the open position.
*   **f6d8, f6e7, f6g6, f6e6, f6g5, f6f5, f6h4, f6f4:** The knight on f6 has a lot of options.
*   **d6f8, d6e7, d6c5, c6d8, c6b8, c6e7, c6a5, c6d4, c6b4:** The bishop on d6 has good diagonals.
*   **d5e7, d5b6, d5f4, d5b4, d5e3, d5c3:** The bishop on d5 has good diagonals.
*   **e8g8:** King move is risky.
*   **e5f4:** This is a pawn move that opens the position.
*   **g7g6, b7b6, a7a6, h6h5, g7g5, b7b5, a7a5:** Pawn moves.

Considering the threats and the need to develop, I think the best move is to develop my knight and challenge the center. I'll move the knight from f6 to e4. This attacks the center and prepares to challenge white's control.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, I've got a lot of options. Let's analyze them.

*   **Queen moves:** The queen on d6 has several moves, but I need to be careful not to leave it exposed. Moving to f6, e6, or g5 looks interesting, as it develops the queen and attacks white's pieces.
*   **Pawn moves:** Pawn moves are generally safe. Moving the h-pawn to h5 or h6 is a good idea to control the h-file. Pushing the f-pawn to f6 or f5 is also a good idea to challenge white's center.
*   **Other moves:** The other moves seem less impactful at this stage.

Considering the position, I think developing the queen to f6 is a good move. It attacks the knight on f3 and opens up the diagonal for the bishop on c8.

Okay, I have a lot of options. Let's analyze a few of the most promising ones:

*   **...h7:** This seems like a solid developing move, preparing to control the h-file and potentially connect the rooks.
*   **...g6:** This supports the f6 knight and prepares to fianchetto the black bishop on g7.
*   **...e7:** This is a standard developing move, but it doesn't immediately address the central tension.
*   **...c5:** This challenges white's control of the center and opens the c-file. This seems like a good option.

I think I'll go with ...c5. It's a direct challenge to white's center and opens up possibilities for my queen and bishop.
