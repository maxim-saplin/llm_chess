--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, I have a lot of options. Let's analyze a bit.

*   **Pawn moves:** Pushing pawns is always a consideration. I could advance the pawns on the kingside (h7h6, g7g6, f7f6) or the queenside (a7a6, b7b6, c7c6, d7d6). I could also consider pushing them two squares (h7h5, g7g5, f7f5, d7d5, c7c5, b7b5, a7a5), but that's a bit more committal early on.
*   **Knight moves:** The knights on g8 and b8 have several options. g8e7, g8h6, g8f6, b8c6, b8a6.
*   **Bishop moves:** The bishop on f8 has a few diagonals to consider (f8e7, f8d6, f8c5, f8b4, f8a3).
*   **Queen moves:** The queen on d8 has a lot of options (d8e7, d8f6, d8g5, d8h4).
*   **King moves:** The king on e8 has one move (e8e7).

Considering the position, I think a good developing move is to bring the knight out. I'll develop the knight to f6, controlling some central squares and preparing for further development.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Okay, I have a lot of options. Let's analyze...

The most pressing issue is the open file on the h-file. White's rook on h1 is a potential threat. I could move my rook to defend, but that might be passive. My knight on f6 is well-placed, and I have a few options for developing my bishop. I also see I can push my pawns.

I think I'll develop my bishop to a more active square and control the center a bit.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, I have a good list of moves to consider. Let's break this down.

*   **King moves:** The king has a few options, but none seem particularly urgent.
*   **Queen moves:** The queen has many options, but I need to be careful about developing it too early.
*   **Bishop moves:** The bishop on c8 has some interesting diagonals.
*   **Knight moves:** The knight on f6 has several options, and the knight on b8 has a few as well.
*   **Pawn moves:** Pawns can advance, but I need to be careful about overextending.

Considering the position, I think developing the knight on b8 to c6 is a solid developing move. It controls central squares and prepares for potential pawn advances.

Okay, I have a lot of options. Let's analyze a bit.

*   **King Safety:** My king is currently safe, but I need to be mindful of potential attacks.
*   **Piece Development:** I want to develop my pieces and control the center of the board.
*   **Pawn Structure:** I need to consider how my pawn structure will affect the game.

Considering all this, I'll develop my knight to a good square. The move `c6d4` looks interesting, attacking the pawn on e5.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

You are absolutely right! My apologies. I misread the board. The knight on c6 is pinned by the white bishop. I need to find a different move.

Let's re-evaluate. I still want to develop a piece. The move `h7h6` seems solid, preparing to develop the rook.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, I've got a lot of options. Let's analyze them.

*   **Pawn moves:** I see a lot of pawn moves available. `b7b6`, `a7a6`, `h6h5`, `b7b5`, `a7a5` are standard pawn advances. `e5e4` is interesting as it opens the position.
*   **Knight moves:** The knights on f6 and c6 have several possible moves. `f6g8`, `f6h7`, `f6d7`, `f6h5`, `f6g4`, `f6e4`, `c6b8`, `c6e7`, `c6a5`, `c6b4`
*   **Bishop moves:** The bishop on d8 has many options. `d8e7`, `d8d7`, `d8d6`, `c8d7`, `c8e6`, `c8f5`, `c8g4`, `c8h3`
*   **Rook moves:** The rook on h8 has limited moves. `h8g8`, `h8f8`, `h8h7`
*   **Queen moves:** The queen on d8 has many options. `d8e7`, `d8d7`, `d8d6`
*   **King moves:** The king on e8 has limited moves. `e8f8`, `e8e7`, `e8d7`

The position is relatively open, and white has a strong center. I want to develop my pieces and challenge white's control of the center. I think the most active move is to develop my knight and challenge the center.

I'll choose `f6e4`. This attacks the pawn on d4 and opens the position for my pieces.

*   **White's Queen and Bishop on d3 are targeting my King.** I need to address this.
*   **White's Knight on f3 is also a threat.**

Considering the available moves, I think the best move is to develop my Queen's Bishop to a square where it defends my King and potentially attacks White's pieces. **...Bg4** seems like a good option. It attacks the Knight on f3 and defends the h5 square.

Okay, I see the board. White has a strong attack developing, and my king is a bit exposed. I need to find a move that addresses the immediate threats and develops my pieces. Let's see what my options are.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, that's a lot of moves. Let's analyze them.

*   **King safety:** The most immediate concern is the exposed king. Moving the rook on h8 doesn't immediately help.
*   **Development:** I need to develop my pieces to counterattack. The knight on c6 looks like a good candidate to move.
*   **Defense:** The pawn on e7 is under attack.
*   **Attacking opportunities:** The queen on d4 is a threat.

Considering these factors, I think the knight move to f6 looks promising. It defends the pawn on e7, develops the knight to a more active square, and potentially challenges white's control of the center.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Okay, I see the legal moves. The pawn on f6 has a few options. The pawn on d6 can advance. The knight on g4 can move to d7.

Let's analyze these:

*   **f6f7:** This doesn't seem to achieve much. It just pushes the pawn forward.
*   **f6e7:** This also doesn't seem to help much.
*   **f6g6:** This doesn't seem to help much.
*   **f6e6:** This doesn't seem to help much.
*   **f6f5:** This challenges the center, but it also opens the f-file and could weaken my king's position further.
*   **d6d7:** This doesn't seem to achieve much.
*   **g4d7:** This is interesting. It attacks the queen and also forks the rook on a8. This seems like the best move.

Therefore, I will move the knight from g4 to d7.

Okay, I have a lot of options. Let's analyze the possibilities:

*   **Rook moves:** Moving the rook on h8 doesn't seem immediately helpful.
*   **Bishop moves:** The bishop on d7 has some interesting diagonals, but moving it now doesn't seem to improve the position significantly.
*   **Pawn moves:** Pushing pawns on the kingside (h6, g7) could weaken the king's position further. Pushing the a-pawn or b-pawn is slow.
*   **Knight moves:** The knight on c6 has several options. Nc6-e7 seems like a good developing move, getting the knight to a more active square.
*   **Pawn moves:** The pawn on e5 can move to e4 or d4.
*   **Queen moves:** The queen on d6 has several options.

Considering the position, I think the most important thing is to develop a piece and challenge white's control of the center. **Ne7** seems like a solid developing move that also prepares to challenge the center.

*   **Knight moves:** The knight on f6 has a few options, but nothing immediately impactful.
*   **Pawn moves:** I have a lot of pawn moves available. Pushing the pawns in front of the king seems like a good idea to create a pawn shield.
*   **Queen moves:** The queen on d4 has many options, but I want to be careful not to expose it.

Considering the position, I think pushing the pawn to g6 is a solid developing move. It supports the knight on f6, and prepares for further pawn advances.

Okay, I see the board. White has a strong attack developing, and my king is somewhat exposed. I need to find a move that addresses the immediate threats and develops my pieces. Let's see what moves are available.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, that's a lot of moves. Let's analyze the most critical ones. White is threatening to push their pawns and potentially open up lines against my king. I need to consider:

*   **Defending the King:** The immediate threats seem to be related to the open files and the potential for white's queen to join the attack.
*   **Developing Pieces:** I need to get my pieces active to counterattack.
*   **Preventing White's Advance:** Stopping white's pawn pushes is crucial.

Considering the available moves, I think the best move is to develop my knight and challenge the center.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, I've got a lot of options. The white queen on f7 is a major threat. I need to find a way to defend against it. Let's analyze some of the key moves:

*   **...h7h6** or **...h7h5**: These moves don't immediately address the queen threat and might weaken the kingside further.
*   **...e7e6** or **...e7e5**: These moves block the queen's attack on f7, but they also restrict the bishop on f8.
*   **...d7d6** or **...d7d5**: Similar to the e-pawn moves, these block the queen and develop a pawn.
*   **...f6f5**: This attacks the knight on e4, but it doesn't address the immediate threat.
*   **...g6g5**: This weakens the kingside.

I think the best move is to defend the queen's attack and develop a piece. I'll play **...e7e6**. This blocks the queen's attack on f7 and prepares to develop the bishop on f8.

Alright, that's a lot of moves to consider. White's threats are clear: the queen and rooks are targeting the kingside. I need to prioritize defense and development.

Here's my thought process:

*   **King Safety:** The king is vulnerable. Moving the h-pawn to h7 might offer some protection, but it's slow.
*   **Development:** I need to develop my pieces to counterattack. The bishop on d7 is currently blocked.
*   **Defense:** The pawn on e6 is under attack.
*   **Tactics:** I need to be aware of any immediate tactical opportunities or threats.

Considering all of this, I think the best move is to develop the bishop and defend the pawn on e6.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Okay, that's a lot of moves! Let's analyze the position. White has a strong attack brewing, and my king is a bit exposed. I need to be careful.

*   **Rook moves:** The rook moves don't seem immediately helpful.
*   **Bishop moves:** The bishop on c6 has some interesting options.
*   **Queen moves:** The queen on e6 has a lot of options, but many of them lead to trades or don't improve the position.
*   **Pawn moves:** Pawn moves are important for controlling the center and supporting my pieces.

I see a few candidate moves:

*   **...Bf7:** This develops the bishop and attacks the white knight on g5.
*   **...Qf7:** This develops the queen and attacks the white knight on g5.
*   **...h6h5:** This prevents white from playing g4.
*   **...b7b6:** This supports the pawn on a7.

I think the most active move is to develop the bishop and attack the knight.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

You are absolutely right! My apologies. I made a mistake. The bishop on c6 cannot move to f7. I need to be more careful. Let's re-evaluate.

Looking at the board again, and the legal moves:

*   **...h6h5:** This seems like a good prophylactic move to prevent g4. It also opens a potential escape square for the king.
*   **...b7b6:** This supports the pawn structure.
*   **...e6f7:** This develops the queen and attacks the knight on g5.

I'm leaning towards ...h6h5. It's the most solid move.

Okay, that's a lot of moves. Let's analyze them.

*   **Rook moves:** The rook moves don't seem to immediately help.
*   **Pawn moves:** Pushing pawns on the kingside (h7, h6) doesn't seem to achieve much. The pawn moves a7a6, a7a5, b7b6, b7b5 are passive. g6g5 is also not very helpful.
*   **Bishop moves:** The bishop on c6 has some interesting options. ...Be8 would develop the bishop and potentially defend the king. ...Bd7 is also a possibility. ...Bb5 attacks the knight, but it might be better to develop first.
*   **Queen moves:** The queen is well-placed.
*   **King moves:** The king has no safe moves.
*   **Pawn moves:** e4d6 is not a good move.
*   **Knight moves:** The knight on d4 has several options. ...Nf5 attacks the queen and develops the knight.

Considering the position, I think the best move is to develop the bishop and defend the king.

Okay, that's a lot of moves. Let's analyze the most critical ones.

*   **Defensive moves:**
    *   `h8g8`, `h8f8`, `h8h7`, `h8h6`: Moving the rook doesn't seem to help much against the immediate threats.
    *   `e8f7`, `e8d7`: Moving the king is probably the most important thing to consider. `e8f7` looks like a reasonable escape route.
    *   `e6f7`, `e6e7`, `e6d7`, `e6d6`, `e6c6`, `e6b6`, `e6a6`: Moving the pawn in front of the king.

*   **Developing moves:**
    *   `d4c6`, `d4f5`, `d4b5`, `d4f3`, `d4b3`, `d4e2`, `d4c2`: Moving the pawn.
    *   `g6g5`, `c7c6`, `b7b6`, `a7a6`, `c7c5`, `b7b5`, `a7a5`: Pushing pawns.

Considering the immediate danger to the king, I think the best move is to move the king to a safer square. `e8f7` looks like the most promising option. It gets the king out of the direct line of fire and opens up a potential escape route to g6.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Okay, I have the legal moves. White is clearly attacking, and the queen on f6 is a major threat. Let's analyze the options:

*   **Rook moves (h8...):** These don't seem to help much, as they don't address the immediate threats.
*   **Rook moves (a8...):** Same as above.
*   **Bishop moves (f7...):** Moving the bishop doesn't seem to help.
*   **King moves (e6...):** The king is in a precarious position. Moving to e7 seems like the most sensible option to get out of the immediate pin.
*   **Pawn moves (e4...):** These don't help.
*   **Pawn moves (d4...):** These don't help.
*   **Pawn moves (g6...):** These don't help.
*   **Pawn moves (c7...):** These don't help.
*   **Pawn moves (b7...):** These don't help.
*   **Pawn moves (a7...):** These don't help.
*   **Pawn moves (g6...):** These don't help.

The most important thing is to get the king out of the pin. Moving the king to e7 seems like the best move.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, I have a lot of options. White's queen and bishops are targeting my king, so I need to prioritize defense.

*   **h8g8, h8f8, h8e8, h8d8, h8c8, h8b8, h8h7, h8h6:** Moving the rook on h8 doesn't seem to help the immediate threat.
*   **a8g8, a8f8, a8e8, a8d8, a8c8, a8b8:** Moving the rook on a8 also doesn't address the immediate danger.
*   **f7g8, f7e8, f7e6:** Moving the bishop on f7 doesn't seem to help.
*   **e7f8, e7e8, e7d8, e7d7, e7e6, e7d6, e7c5, e7b4:** Moving the pawn on e7 seems like a good idea to protect the king. e7e6 looks like the best option.
*   **f6g7, f6f5:** Moving the knight on f6 isn't helpful right now.
*   **e4d6, e4g5, e4c5, e4g3, e4c3, e4f2, e4d2:** Moving the knight on e4 doesn't seem to help.
*   **d4e6, d4c6, d4f5, d4b5, d4f3, d4b3, d4e2, d4c2:** Moving the pawn on d4 doesn't seem to help.
*   **g6f5:** Moving the pawn on g6 doesn't seem to help.
*   **c7c6, b7b6, a7a6, g6g5, c7c5, b7b5, a7a5:** Pushing the pawns on the queenside doesn't seem to address the immediate threat.

Therefore, the best move is to move the pawn on e7 to e6 to block the white queen's attack.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, that's a lot of moves. White's queen and rooks are bearing down on my king. I need to find a way to defend and possibly counter-attack. Let's analyze the moves:

*   **Rook moves (h8...):** These are mostly defensive, but don't immediately address the threat.
*   **Rook moves (a8...):** Similar to the h8 rook, defensive.
*   **Bishop moves (f7...):** Doesn't seem to help much.
*   **Pawn moves (f6...):** f6f5 looks interesting, challenging the center.
*   **Queen moves (e6...):** These are all over the place, but don't seem to help.
*   **Pawn moves (e4...):** This is a pawn, not a queen.
*   **Knight moves (d4...):** The knight on d4 is under attack.
*   **Pawn moves (g6...):** g6g5 is a possibility.
*   **Pawn moves (c7, b7, a7...):** These are slow and don't address the immediate threat.
*   **Pawn moves (g6...):** g6g5 is a possibility.
*   **Pawn moves (c7, b7, a7...):** These are slow and don't address the immediate threat.

The most promising move seems to be **f6f5**. This attacks the white knight on e4, opens the f-file for my rook, and challenges the center. It also potentially creates a passed pawn.

Therefore, I will make the move f6f5.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, I have a lot of options. Let's analyze them.

*   **Rook moves (h8g8, h8f8, etc.):** These don't seem to help much immediately.
*   **Rook moves (a8g8, a8f8, etc.):** Same as above.
*   **Bishop moves (f7g8, f7e8):** Not particularly useful.
*   **Pawn moves (e6e8, e6c8, etc.):** These are all illegal.
*   **Pawn moves (f5f6):** This blocks the white knight's attack on the king, but it also opens up the g-file.
*   **Knight moves (e4f6, e4d6, etc.):** The knight on e4 is under attack. Moving it is necessary.
*   **Pawn moves (c7c6, b7b6, a7a6, g6g5, c7c5, b7b5, a7a5):** These are all pawn moves.

The most pressing issue is the knight on e4. It's under attack and needs to move. I see a few options:

*   **e4f6:** This attacks the white knight on g5, but it also opens the g-file for a potential white attack.
*   **e4d6:** This develops the knight and attacks a pawn, but it doesn't address the immediate threat.
*   **e4c5:** This develops the knight and attacks the white queen. This seems like the best option.

Therefore, I will move the knight from e4 to c5.

Okay, I see the board. White's queen is dangerously placed, and my king is somewhat exposed. I need to find a move that addresses these threats and develops my pieces. Let's see what moves are available.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Okay, I see the move f5f6. This looks like a good developing move, attacking the white knight on e4 and potentially opening lines for my queen. I'll make that move.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, I've got a lot of options. Let's analyze. White's queen on d4 is a major threat. I need to consider how to defend against it.

*   **e8h8, e8g8, e8f8, e8d8, e8c8, e8b8:** Moving the rook doesn't immediately address the queen threat.
*   **e8e7:** Moving the rook to e7 seems passive.
*   **a8d8, a8c8, a8b8:** Moving the rook doesn't immediately address the queen threat.
*   **f7g8:** Moving the pawn to g8 is not a good move.
*   **f6g7, f6e7:** Moving the pawn doesn't immediately address the queen threat.
*   **e6c8, e6e7, e6d7, e6d6, e6c6, e6b6, e6a6, e6f5, e6g4, e6h3:** The knight moves are interesting, but don't directly address the queen.
*   **c5d7, c5a6, c5e4, c5a4, c5d3, c5b3:** These are all knight moves.
*   **d4c6, d4f5, d4b5, d4f3, d4b3, d4e2, d4c2:** These are knight moves.
*   **c7c6, b7b6, a7a6, g6g5, e5e4, b7b5, a7a5:** These are pawn moves.

The most pressing issue is the threat to my king. I need to develop a piece to defend. The knight on e6 is well-placed to defend.

Let's move the knight to defend the king. I will move the knight from e6 to g7.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, that's a lot of moves to consider. White's queen and rook on the d-file are a major threat. My king is also vulnerable. I need to prioritize defense.

*   **e8h8, e8g8, e8f8, e8d8, e8c8, e8b8, e8e7:** Moving the king doesn't seem to solve the problem, as it's still exposed.
*   **a8d8, a8c8, a8b8:** Moving the rook doesn't seem to help much either.
*   **g7h8, g7g8, g7f8, g7h7, g7h6, g7f6:** Moving the pawn doesn't seem to help.
*   **f7g8:** Moving the pawn doesn't seem to help.
*   **e6c8, e6e7, e6d7, e6f6, e6d6, e6c6, e6b6, e6a6, e6f5, e6g4, e6h3:** The knight moves are interesting, but don't immediately address the threats.
*   **c5d7, c5a6, c5e4, c5a4, c5d3, c5b3:** The bishop moves don't seem to help.
*   **d4c6, d4f5, d4b5, d4f3, d4b3, d4e2, d4c2:** The knight moves don't seem to help.
*   **d5c4:** This pawn move might open up the position too much.
*   **c7c6, b7b6, a7a6, g6g5, e5e4, b7b5, a7a5:** These pawn moves don't seem to help.

Looking at the position, I think I need to try to trade off some pieces to relieve the pressure. The knight on e6 looks like a good candidate. I'll try to develop it to a square where it can attack the white queen.

I'll move my knight from e6 to f6. This attacks the White queen.

*   **a8d8, a8c8, a8b8:** Moving the Rook doesn't seem to help much either.
*   **g7h8, g7g8, g7f8, g7h7, g7h6:** Moving the pawn doesn't seem to help much either.

*   **c5d7, c5e6, c5a6, c5e4, c5a4, c5d3, c5b3:** Moving the Queen doesn't seem to help much either.
*   **d4e6, d4c6, d4f5, d4b5, d4f3, d4b3, d4e2, d4c2:** Moving the pawn doesn't seem to help much either.
*   **d5c4:** Moving the pawn doesn't seem to help much either.
*   **c7c6, b7b6, a7a6, g6g5, e5e4, b7b5, a7a5:** Moving the pawns doesn't seem to help much either.

**f6e4** looks like the most promising move. It develops the Knight, attacks a pawn, and opens a line for the Queen.

- 'get_legal_moves' to get a UCI formatted list of available moves
- 'make_move <UCI formatted move>' when you are ready to complete your turn (e.g., 'make_move e2e4')

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, I have a list of legal moves. Let's analyze them.

*   **Pawn moves:** Pushing pawns is generally a good idea in the opening to control the center and develop pieces. I see a few options: `h7h6`, `e7e6`, `d7d6`, `c7c6`, `b7b6`, `a7a6`, `h7h5`, `e7e5`, `d7d5`, `c7c5`, `b7b5`, `a7a5`.
*   **Knight moves:** `b8c6`, `b8a6`, `f6g8`, `f6h5`, `f6d5`, `f6g4`, `f6e4`. Developing the knights is also important.
*   **Bishop moves:** `f8g7`, `f8h6`. Developing the bishop is also important.
*   **Rook moves:** None.
*   **Queen moves:** None.
*   **King moves:** None.

Considering the position, I think developing the knight on f6 is a good idea. It controls important central squares and prepares for further development. I'll move the knight to d5.

Alright, I have a list of legal moves. Let's analyze them.

*   **Pawn moves:** a7-a6, a7-a5, b7-b6, b7-b5, c7-c6, c7-c5, d7-d6, e7-e6, e7-e5, f7-f6, f7-f5, g6-g5, h7-h6, h7-h5. These are standard pawn moves.
*   **Knight moves:** b8-c6, b8-a6, d5-f6, d5-b6, d5-f4, d5-b4, d5-e3, d5-c3. The knight on d5 has several options.
*   **Bishop moves:** f8-g7, f8-h6. The bishop on f8 has a few options.
*   **Rook moves:** h8-g8. The rook on h8 has one option.

The position is relatively open, and white has developed a knight to d5. I need to be careful about that knight. I think I'll start by developing my knight.

I'll move the knight from b8 to c6.

*   **...f8g7**: Develops the bishop to a good diagonal.
*   **...d8f6**: Develops the queen to a more active square.
*   **...d7d6**: Supports the pawn structure and prepares to develop the bishop.
*   **...h7h6**: Awaiting further development.

I think developing the queen is a good idea. It puts pressure on the center and prepares for further action.

*   **King moves:** The king has limited moves.
*   **Knight moves:** The knight on f6 has several moves.

Considering the position, I'll prioritize development and control of the center. The move ...**g6g5** seems like a good developing move, challenging the center and potentially opening the h-file for my rook.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Okay, I have a lot of options. Let's analyze them.

*   **Developing the Bishop:** `f8g7`, `f8e7`, `f8h6`, `f8d6`, `f8c5`, `f8b4`, `f8a3` - Developing the bishop is a good idea. `f8g7` looks passive. `f8e7` is a decent developing move, but doesn't immediately address any threats. `f8h6` is a bit odd. `f8d6` and `f8c5` are potentially good, aiming at the center. `f8b4` and `f8a3` are too passive.
*   **King Moves:** `e8d8`, `e8e7` - Moving the king is not a priority right now.
*   **Rook Moves:** `a8b8` - Not useful at this stage.
*   **Knight Moves:** `f6d8`, `f6g7`, `f6e7`, `f6h6`, `f6g6`, `f6e6`, `f6d6`, `f6f5`, `f6f4`, `f6f3`, `f6f2` - The knight on f6 has a lot of options. `f6g7` is passive. `f6e7` is a good developing move. `f6d6` is also interesting, but blocks the bishop. `f6f5` attacks the pawn and opens the diagonal for the bishop.
*   **Pawn Moves:** `h7h6`, `d7d6`, `b7b6`, `a7a6`, `e5e4`, `h7h5`, `b7b5`, `a7a5` - Pawn moves are generally less important in the opening, but some can be useful. `d7d6` supports the pawn structure. `h7h6` is a standard move. `e5e4` is a bad idea, it opens the position for white.

Considering the position, I think the best move is to develop the knight to e7, preparing to challenge the center and support the pawn structure.

Okay, I've got a lot of options. Let's analyze them.

*   **Queen moves:** The queen on e7 has many options. Moving the queen to a3, b4, c5, d6, g5, f6, d8, or even h6 seems a bit risky.
*   **Pawn moves:** The pawn moves are mostly developing moves.
*   **Knight moves:** The knight on c6 has some interesting options.

I think I will develop my knight to d4 to control the center. This also attacks the white pawn on f3.

Okay, I have a lot of options. Let's analyze a few of them.

*   **...Qf6:** This develops the queen and attacks the knight on d4. It also prepares to challenge White's control of the center.
*   **...h6:** This prevents a potential white knight jump to g5.
*   **...e6:** This supports the pawn on d5 and prepares to develop the light-squared bishop.
*   **...d6:** This supports the pawn on e5.

I think ...Qf6 is the most active move, immediately putting pressure on White.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, that's a lot of moves. White's Queen is a real threat. I need to consider the following:

*   **King Safety:** The King is exposed. I need to think about how to improve its safety.
*   **Development:** I need to develop my pieces to counterattack.
*   **Defense:** I need to defend against White's immediate threats.

Let's analyze some of the moves:

*   **...h6:** This is a standard pawn move to prevent a potential check on g7. It's a solid defensive move.
*   **...f6e7:** This develops the Bishop, but it doesn't immediately address the threat.
*   **...f6g7:** This develops the Bishop, but it doesn't immediately address the threat.
*   **...d7d6:** This supports the e5 pawn and prepares to develop the Queen's Bishop.
*   **...e5e4:** This opens the position and could lead to complications, but it also weakens the pawn structure.
*   **...d5b6:** This develops the Bishop, but it doesn't immediately address the threat.

Considering the position, I think the most important thing is to improve the King's safety and develop a piece. ...h6 is a good start.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, I've got a lot of options. Let's analyze them.

*   **Pawn moves:** I have many pawn moves available. Pushing the pawns in front of my king (h7, e7, d6, c6, b6, a6) seems like a solid defensive approach. Pushing the pawns in the center (c5, b5, a5) could open up the position, but might expose my king.
*   **Bishop moves:** The bishop on f8 has a lot of potential diagonals. Moving it to g7, e7, d6, c5, b4, or a3 could develop it and put pressure on the white pieces.
*   **King moves:** The king can move to d8 or e7. This is not necessary right now.
*   **Rook moves:** The rook can move to a8 or b8. This is not necessary right now.
*   **Knight moves:** The knight on f6 has a lot of potential moves. Moving it to g7, e7, g6, e6, d6, c6, b6, a6, g5, f5, f4 could develop it and put pressure on the white pieces.
*   **Queen moves:** The queen can move to d8. This is not necessary right now.

The position is relatively closed. I think developing my bishop and knight is a good idea. I'll start by developing my knight to e7.

Okay, I have a lot of options. Let's analyze a bit. The white queen is a threat, but I have a queen of my own. I see a few immediate possibilities:

*   **Defensive:** Moving the rook on h8 to h7 (h8h7) defends against a potential threat on the h-file.
*   **Developing:** Moving the pawn on d5 (d5d6) develops a pawn and challenges the center.
*   **Attacking:** Moving the pawn on e6 (e6e5) attacks the center and opens lines for my queen.

I think the most active and promising move is to challenge the center.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

My apologies, I seem to have made an illegal move. I'll try again. Let's re-evaluate. The board is:

```
♜ ⭘ ♝ ⭘ ♚ ⭘ ⭘ ♜

♙ ⭘ ⭘ ♗ ♙ ♔ ⭘ ⭘
♖ ♘ ⭘ ♕ ⭘ ♗ ♘ ♖
```

And the legal moves are:

```
h8g8,h8f8,h8h7,e8f8,e8d8,e8e7,a8b8,g7f8,g7f6,e6e7,e6g6,e6f6,e6d6,e6c6,e6b6,e6a6,e6f5,e6g4,d5e7,d5f6,d5b6,d5f4,d5b4,d5e3,d5c3,d4c6,d4f5,d4b5,d4f3,d4b3,d4e2,d4c2,e8g8,f7g6,e5f4,f7f6,d7d6,c7c6,b7b6,a7a6,h6h5,e5e4,f7f5,c7c5,b7b5,a7a5
```

I see my mistake. I was trying to move the pawn on e6 to e5, but that square is occupied by a white pawn. I need to choose a different move. Let's try developing the pawn on d5.

Alright, I've got the list of legal moves. Let's consider the options.

*   **Pawn moves:** Pushing pawns is a good way to control the center and develop pieces. I see a lot of pawn moves available.
*   **Knight moves:** The knights on g8 and b8 have several options.
*   **Bishop moves:** The bishop on f8 has a few diagonal options.
*   **Queen moves:** The queen on d8 has a lot of options.
*   **King moves:** The king on e8 has one option.

I'll start by developing a piece. I'll move the knight from g8 to f6. This develops the knight, controls some central squares, and prepares for further development.

Alright, I have a good list of moves. Let's think this through. White seems to have a solid pawn structure, and I need to develop my pieces and challenge their control of the center.

The move ...Bg4 looks interesting, pinning the knight on f3. However, I don't see a knight on f3. So, I'll look for a more solid developing move. ...e7e6 looks like a good move to support the pawn structure and prepare for further development.

Okay, I see the board. White has a strong center, but my pieces are relatively well-developed. Let's get the legal moves to see my options.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, I have a lot of options. Let's analyze a bit.

*   **Pawn moves:** I have several pawn moves available. Pushing the pawns on the kingside (g7-g6 or g7-g5) could be useful for controlling the center and preparing for a kingside attack later. Pushing the pawns on the queenside (a7-a6, a7-a5, b7-b6, b7-b5, c7-c6, c7-c5) could be useful for controlling the center and preparing for a queenside attack later.
*   **Knight moves:** The knight on b8 has several moves. Nc6 looks like a good developing move, controlling central squares.
*   **Bishop moves:** The bishop on c8 has several moves.
*   **Queen moves:** The queen on d8 has several moves.
*   **King moves:** The king on e8 has several moves.
*   **Rook moves:** The rook on h8 has several moves.

Considering the position, I think developing my knight to c6 is a solid developing move that controls central squares.

Okay, I have a lot of options. Let's analyze a few of the more interesting ones:

*   **...h7h5:** This challenges White's control of the h-file and can open up lines for my rook.
*   **...e7e6:** This supports my pawn structure and prepares to develop my bishop.
*   **...d8d7:** This develops my queen and prepares for castling.
*   **...c8f5:** This develops my bishop and attacks the knight on c3.
*   **...g7g6:** This supports my pawn structure and prepares to develop my bishop.

I think I like the idea of developing my queen and preparing to castle. I'll play ...Qd7.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, I've got a lot of options. White's queen and bishop are targeting the kingside, so I need to be careful.

*   **h8h7:** This seems like a reasonable move to develop the rook and potentially defend the h-file.
*   **e7d6:** This opens the diagonal for the queen and bishop, and might be a good developing move.
*   **e7d8:** This is a very interesting move, developing the queen to a safe square.
*   **f6h5:** This attacks the knight, but it might not be the best use of the knight.
*   **g7g6:** This supports the kingside and prevents a potential white knight jump.
*   **d7d6:** This blocks the diagonal of the white bishop.

Considering the position, I think developing the queen to d8 is a good move. It gets the queen off the back rank and potentially prepares for counterplay.

Alright, I have a list of legal moves. White's queen is a major threat. I need to consider how to defend against it and develop my pieces.

*   **h8g8, h8f8, h8h7, e8f8, e8e7, d8e7, a8b8:** These moves don't seem to address the immediate threats.
*   **d7e7, d7e6, d7d6, d7f5, d7g4, d7h3:** Moving the queen is tempting, but it could lead to further complications. d7e7 blocks the queen's attack on the king, but it doesn't develop a piece. d7d6 is a solid developing move.
*   **f6g8, f6h7, f6h5, f6g4, f6e4:** Moving the knight doesn't seem to help much in the current situation.
*   **c6b8, c6e7, c6a5, c6d4, c6b4:** Moving the knight doesn't seem to help much in the current situation.
*   **e8g8:** This move doesn't seem to help much in the current situation.
*   **h6g5, e5d4, d5e4, g7g6, b7b6, a7a6, h6h5, b7b5, a7a5:** These pawn moves don't seem to address the immediate threats.

I think the best move is to develop my queen to d6. This defends the king and prepares to counterattack.

Alright, I have a lot of moves to consider. White's queen and bishop are targeting my king. I need to find a move that defends against the immediate threats and ideally develops a piece or creates counterplay.

Let's analyze some key moves:

*   **...h8h7:** This seems like a reasonable defensive move, getting the rook out of the back rank and potentially preparing for a later kingside defense.
*   **...e8e7:** This move protects the king and opens a path for the king to escape.
*   **...d8e7:** This move also protects the king.
*   **...c8d7:** This move develops the bishop and potentially prepares for a later kingside defense.
*   **...f6h7:** This move develops the knight and attacks the white rook.
*   **...f6d7:** This move develops the knight and protects the king.
*   **...g7g6:** This move defends the king.

I'm leaning towards a move that immediately addresses the king safety. Between ...e8e7 and ...d8e7, I prefer ...e8e7 because it opens a path for the king to escape.

*   **...d6d7**: This protects the king.
*   **...e7e6**: This protects the king.

The most pressing issue is the attack on the king. I think I need to prioritize defense. The pawn moves don't immediately help. The bishop move is interesting, but I think I need to protect the king first.

I'll play **...e7e6** to protect the king.

Alright, I have a lot of options. White's queen is a threat, and I need to address that. I also want to develop my pieces.

*   **...Qd7** seems like a good developing move, putting pressure on the center and defending the king. It also opens up the diagonal for the dark-squared bishop.

Therefore, I will make the move Qd7.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, I have a lot of options. Let's break this down.

*   **Rook moves:** The rook on h8 has a few options, but moving it doesn't seem immediately helpful.
*   **Bishop moves:** The bishop on c8 has some diagonal moves, but none seem to improve my position significantly right now.
*   **Knight moves:** The knight on f6 has a lot of options, but I need to be careful not to leave my king too exposed.
*   **Queen moves:** The queen on d6 has a lot of options, but I need to be careful not to leave my king too exposed.
*   **Pawn moves:** I have several pawn moves available. Pushing pawns in front of the king (g7-g6, h6-h5) could help with defense, but I don't want to weaken my pawn structure too much.
*   **King moves:** The king cannot move.

Considering the position, I think the most important thing is to develop my pieces and try to challenge white's control of the center. I'm going to develop my knight to a good square.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Okay, I have a lot of options. Let's analyze a bit.

*   **Threats to the King:** The most immediate threat is the queen. I need to consider how to exploit this.
*   **Knight on c6:** This knight is well-placed and can attack the king.
*   **Pawn Structure:** The pawn structure is relatively closed.

Considering the position, I think the best move is to bring the knight to a more active position, directly attacking the king.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, that's a lot of moves. Let's analyze them.

*   **Rook moves:** The rook on h8 has several options, but none seem immediately helpful. Moving it to g8, f8, e8, or d8 doesn't improve the position significantly. h8h7 is a passive move.
*   **Bishop moves:** The bishop on f8 has a few options, but none are particularly strong.
*   **Pawn moves:** The pawn moves are the most interesting. I need to challenge white's center.
    *   ...e6e5 looks like a good option, challenging the center.
    *   ...d6c6, ...d6b6, ...d6a6, ...d6e5, ...d6c5, ...d6b4, ...d6a3 are all pawn moves that don't seem to help much.
    *   ...g7g6, ...f7f6, ...c7c6, ...b7b6, ...a7a6, ...h6h5, ...g7g5, ...f7f5, ...c7c5, ...b7b5, ...a7a5 are all pawn moves that don't seem to help much.
*   **Other moves:**
    *   ...d7f8, ...d7b8, ...d7f6, ...d7b6, ...d7e5, ...d7c5 are all pawn moves that don't seem to help much.
    *   ...d5e4 is a pawn move that doesn't seem to help much.

I think the best move here is to challenge the center with ...e6e5. This opens up the position for my queen and bishop and forces white to react.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Okay, I have a lot of options. White's Queen on g7 is a major threat. I need to consider moves that defend against it.

*   **h8h7:** This seems like a reasonable defensive move, protecting the back rank.
*   **e7f6/e7d6:** These moves with the Bishop could help develop and potentially challenge White's control of the center.
*   **g6f6/g6e6/g6d6/g6c6/g6b6/g6a6:** These pawn moves could help to control the center and challenge White's pieces.
*   **d7f6/d7b6:** These moves with the Knight could help develop and potentially challenge White's control of the center.
*   **d5e4:** This pawn move could open up lines for my pieces.
*   **f7f6/f7f5:** These pawn moves could help to control the center and challenge White's pieces.

Considering the immediate threat of the Queen, I think I'll play **h8h7**. This defends the back rank and gives me some time to assess the situation further.

Okay, I see the board. White has a strong attack developing, especially with the Queen on g7. Black's King is exposed. I need to defend and try to develop some counterplay. Let's see what moves are available.

Okay, I've got a lot of options. White's queen on g7 is a major threat. I need to address that immediately. Let's look at the possible defenses.

*   **...e7f6:** This blocks the diagonal, but doesn't develop a piece.
*   **...e7d6:** This also blocks the diagonal and develops the bishop. This looks promising.
*   **...e7c5:** This attacks the knight, but doesn't defend the king directly.
*   **...d7f6:** This blocks the diagonal, but doesn't develop a piece.
*   **...g6f6:** This blocks the diagonal, but doesn't develop a piece.
*   **...g6e6:** This blocks the diagonal, but doesn't develop a piece.
*   **...h6h5:** This doesn't help the defense.
*   **...f7f6:** This doesn't help the defense.

The most active defense seems to be ...e7d6, developing the bishop and blocking the queen's attack. I'll go with that.

Alright, I have a lot of options. Let's analyze the position. White's king is exposed, and I have some pieces that can potentially attack it. The queen on d7 is well-placed, and I have a knight on f6 that could be useful. My pawns are somewhat advanced, but I need to be careful not to overextend.

I think the most promising move is to put pressure on the white king. I'll move my queen to attack the king.

Alright, I've got a lot of options. White is threatening my king, and I need to find a way to defend. Let's analyze some of the key moves:

*   **Defensive Moves:**
    *   `d7f6`: This looks like a good move to develop the bishop and potentially challenge white's control of the center.
    *   `d6f8`: This also develops the bishop and attacks the rook.
    *   `e5f6`: This blocks the attack on the king.
    *   `f5f6`: This also blocks the attack on the king.

*   **Other Considerations:**
    *   I need to be careful about leaving my king exposed.
    *   I want to develop my pieces and control the center.

Considering the threats and the need for development, I think `f5f6` is the most solid move. It blocks the immediate threat and allows me to consolidate my position.

Alright, I have a list of legal moves. White's queen is a major threat, and the knight on f6 is also a problem. I need to consider several things:

*   **Defense:** Protecting the king is paramount.
*   **Development:** Bringing more pieces into the game.
*   **Counterplay:** Creating threats of my own.

Let's analyze some of the moves:

*   **...Qd7-f8:** This looks like a good defensive move, getting the queen out of the line of fire and potentially developing it to a more active square.
*   **...Nf6-e7:** This move blocks the attack on the king and develops the knight.
*   **...g7-g6:** This move prepares to move the knight to f4.
*   **...a7-a6:** This move does not seem to help much.

Considering the threats and the need for development, I think the best move is to move the queen to f8. This defends the king and potentially allows for counterplay.

*   **f8d7:** Develops the bishop, but doesn't immediately address the queen threat.
*   **f8g6:** This also develops the bishop and attacks the queen, forcing a trade. This seems like a good option.
*   **c8d7, c8e6, c8f5, c8g4, c8h3:** These are all developing moves for the other bishop, but less immediately impactful.
*   **a8b8:** Develops the rook, but not a priority right now.
*   **h7h8:** Promotes the pawn, but it's not a good idea to promote to a rook.
*   **f6d8, f6e7, f6g6, f6e6, f6g5, f6f5, f6f4, f6f3, f6f2, f6f1:** These are knight moves.
*   **d6e7, d6c5, d6b4, d6a3:** These are pawn moves.
*   **e5e6, e5e4:** These are pawn moves.
*   **d4e6, d4c6, d4f5, d4b5, d4f3, d4b3, d4e2, d4c2:** These are pawn moves.
*   **h6g5:** This is a pawn move.

*   **g7g6, c7c6, b7b6, a7a6:** These are pawn moves.
*   **h6h5, c7c5, b7b5, a7a5:** These are pawn moves.

**My plan:** I'll develop my bishop to g6, forcing a queen trade. This removes the immediate threat and allows me to consolidate my position.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, I have a lot of options. Let's analyze.

*   **Queen moves:** The queen on d6 has many options. I need to consider the best way to attack the king and develop my pieces.
*   **Knight moves:** The knight on f6 has several moves, some of which could be useful for attacking the king or controlling key squares.
*   **Pawn moves:** Pawn moves are generally less impactful in this position, but some could open lines or support attacks.

The most promising seems to be to attack the king directly. I see a check with the queen.

I will move my queen to f8, checking the king.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

That's a lot of moves! Let's analyze.

*   **King Safety:** My king is relatively safe for now.
*   **Piece Activity:** My pieces are somewhat passive. The bishops on c8 and f8 have limited scope. The knight on g6 is a bit restricted.
*   **Pawn Structure:** The pawn structure is fairly closed.

Considering the position, I think I should try to develop my pieces and control the center. The move ...c7c6 seems like a solid developing move, supporting the pawn on d5 and potentially opening the c-file for my rook.

...Bf8-e7 seems solid. It develops the bishop, and doesn't expose the queen to immediate attack.

Okay, that's a lot of moves to consider.

*   **Rook moves:** The rook moves don't seem to immediately help.
*   **Pawn moves:** Pushing the h-pawn to h8 is not useful. Pushing the b-pawn or a-pawn doesn't seem to help either.
*   **Bishop moves:** The Bishop on e7 has some interesting options. Moving it to d6 seems to be a good defensive move, blocking the Queen's attack on the King.
*   **Knight moves:** The Knight on g6 has some options, but none seem particularly strong.
*   **Queen moves:** The Queen on f6 has many options, but none seem to immediately improve the position.
*   **King moves:** The King has no moves available.
*   **Pawn moves:** The pawn on d5 can move to e4, but that doesn't seem to help.

The Bishop move to d6 seems like the most solid option, blocking the Queen's attack and potentially opening up the diagonal for the Queen.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Okay, I have the legal moves. The position is complex, and there are many possibilities. White's king is exposed, and I need to consider how to exploit that.

My initial thoughts are:

*   **Threaten the King:** I need to look for moves that directly attack the white king or create threats that force White to react defensively.
*   **Develop Pieces:** I should try to improve the position of my pieces, bringing them to more active squares.
*   **Control the Center:** While not immediately critical, controlling the center is often important in chess.

Considering the options, I see a few interesting possibilities.

*   **...Bf5:** This attacks the knight on g1, which is defending the white king. It also opens a diagonal for the bishop.
*   **...Nf3:** This forks the king and rook.

I'll go with the more forcing move.

Alright, that's a lot of moves to consider! Let's break this down. White's king is exposed, and I have some pieces that could potentially attack it. My bishop on e6 looks particularly promising. I also need to be careful not to blunder anything.

I'm going to move my bishop on e6 to attack the king.

That's a lot of moves! Let's analyze. White's King is exposed. I see a few immediate threats, and I need to prioritize.

*   **e7f6** attacks the knight and opens up a potential attack on the king.
*   **e7d6** also attacks the knight.
*   **g6h4** looks interesting, attacking the knight and potentially opening the h-file.
*   **e5e4** looks like a good pawn push to control the center.

I think the most forcing move is **e7f6**. It immediately challenges white's knight and opens lines.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, that's a lot of moves. Let's analyze them.

*   **Rook moves (a8...):** Moving the rook on a8 doesn't seem immediately helpful.
*   **Pawn moves (h7h8, b7b6, a7a6, c6c5, b7b5):** Pushing the h-pawn to h8 is a promotion, but it doesn't seem to help much. The other pawn moves are standard developing moves.
*   **Knight moves (g6...):** The knight on g6 has some interesting options. Moving it to h4 attacks the bishop on f2. Moving it to f8 or e7 doesn't seem to improve the position.
*   **Bishop moves (f6...):** The bishop on f6 has some options. Moving it to d8 or e7 doesn't seem to improve the position.
*   **Bishop moves (g4...):** The bishop on g4 has some interesting options. Moving it to c8, d7, e6, h5, f5, h3.
*   **Knight moves (f3...):** The knight on f3 has some interesting options.
*   **Pawn moves (e5...):** The pawn on e5 has some interesting options.
*   **Pawn moves (c6...):** The pawn on c6 has some interesting options.

The most promising move seems to be to develop the knight on g6 to h4, attacking the bishop on f2. This forces White to react and opens up possibilities for my pieces.

*   **e4f5:** This is a pawn push, attacking the knight on f6. It opens up the diagonal for the bishop on f8.
*   **e4d4:** This is a pawn push, attacking the knight on f6.
*   **e4e3:** This is a pawn push, attacking the knight on f6.
*   **f6c3:** This is a knight move, attacking the pawn on b1.

I think the best move here is to develop the knight and attack the pawn.

Alright, I have a lot of options. Let's analyze this.

*   **Rook moves:** The rook on a8 has many options, but moving it now doesn't seem to achieve much. The rook on h7 also has limited options.
*   **Pawn moves:** I have a lot of pawn moves available. Pushing the pawns on the kingside (g7, f7) seems like a good idea to create some space. Pushing the a, b, and c pawns are also options.
*   **Bishop moves:** The bishop on g4 has some interesting diagonal moves.
*   **Knight moves:** The knight on f3 has several moves, but none immediately threaten anything.
*   **King moves:** The king is safe for now.

Considering the position, I think I should start by developing my pawns on the kingside. I'll push the g-pawn one square.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, I've got a list of legal moves. The position is a bit complex, but I see some immediate possibilities.

The most pressing issue is the potential threat to my king. White's knight on f3 could jump to g5, attacking my bishop and potentially creating further threats. I need to address this.

I'll play ... **g6g5**. This attacks the knight on f3 and forces a response. It also opens the h-file slightly, which could be useful later.

Okay, I have a lot of options. Let's analyze the position. White's king is exposed, and I have a few pieces that can attack it. My bishop on g4 looks particularly dangerous. I also need to consider the threats to my own king.

I think the most promising move is to attack the white king with my bishop.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, that's a lot of moves. Let's analyze them.

*   **Rook moves (a8h8, a8g8, etc.):** Moving the rook doesn't seem to help much in the immediate defense.
*   **Pawn moves (h7h8, f7f6, etc.):** Pushing pawns can help control the center, but I need to prioritize defense.
*   **Bishop moves (e6c8, e6d7, etc.):** The bishop on e6 is a key defender. Moving it is risky.
*   **Knight moves (f3g5, f3e5, etc.):** The knight on f3 is a threat.
*   **Bishop moves (c3h8, c3g7, etc.):** The bishop on c3 is a threat.
*   **Pawn moves (h6g5, c6d5, etc.):** These pawn moves are not immediately helpful.
*   **Pawn moves (f7f5, b7b5, a7a5):** These pawn moves are not immediately helpful.

The most critical threat is the white knight on f3. I need to address that. The move **e6d5** looks like a good defensive move. It attacks the knight and opens a line for my bishop.

*   **e4f5** is not a good move as it doesn't address the threat.
*   **f6g5** is not a good move as it doesn't address the threat.
*   **b7b6** is not a good move as it doesn't address the threat.
*   **a7a6** is not a good move as it doesn't address the threat.
*   **f6f5** is not a good move as it doesn't address the threat.
*   **c6c5** is not a good move as it doesn't address the threat.
*   **b7b5** is not a good move as it doesn't address the threat.
*   **a7a5** is not a good move as it doesn't address the threat.

The best move seems to be to move the rook from a8 to h8 to defend the king.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, I have a good list of moves. The position is a bit tricky. White has a strong attack, and my king is a bit vulnerable. I need to be careful.

I see a few options. Moving the rook on h8 doesn't seem to help much immediately. The pawn moves are also not very impactful right now. The bishop on d5 has some interesting diagonal options. The knight on f3 has a few moves, but they don't seem to address the immediate threats.

I think the most important thing is to try and improve the position of my king. I see that the bishop on c3 can move to several squares. Moving the bishop to b4 looks like a good option. It attacks the white pawn on a3 and potentially opens up a line for my queen.

So, I'll move the bishop from c3 to b4.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, I've got a lot of options. Let's break this down.

*   **Rook moves:** The rook on h8 has many options, but they don't seem immediately impactful.
*   **Pawn moves:** Pushing the pawns looks like a good idea.
*   **Bishop moves:** The bishop on b4 has some interesting diagonals.
*   **Knight moves:** The knight on f3 has a few options.
*   **King moves:** The king is safe for now.

I think pushing the pawns is a good idea to control the center. I'll start with pushing the pawn on c6.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Okay, I have a lot of options. Let's analyze.

*   **Rook moves:** Moving the rook on h8 doesn't seem to help much right now.
*   **Pawn moves:** Pushing pawns like h7-h6 or a7-a6 doesn't immediately address the threats. f6-f5 is interesting, but doesn't solve the problem.
*   **Bishop moves:** The bishop on d5 has some interesting diagonals, but none seem to offer immediate defense.
*   **Knight moves:** The knight on f3 has several moves, but none are particularly effective in the current position.
*   **Pawn moves:** Pushing the b-pawn or c-pawn could open lines, but doesn't address the immediate danger.
*   **Bishop moves:** The bishop on b4 has a few options.

The most pressing issue is the attack on my king. I need to find a move that improves my king's safety and develops a piece.

The move **b4c3** looks interesting. It attacks the white knight and potentially opens a line for my queen.

Let's try that.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, I have a lot of options. White's attack is a concern, especially the potential for a discovered attack on my king. Let's analyze a few key moves:

*   **...h7h6:** This seems like a solid defensive move, preventing a potential rook lift to h7, and potentially preparing for a later ...g5.
*   **...f6f5:** This challenges the center and opens lines for my pieces.
*   **...c5c4:** This attacks the pawn on d4 and opens the c-file for my rook.
*   **...b7b5:** This challenges white's control of the center.

Considering the position, I think the most active and challenging move is ...f6f5. It immediately challenges the center and opens lines for my pieces.

Alright, I have a few options. The immediate threats seem to be around the black king. I see a few defensive moves and some developing moves.

*   **h7h6** looks like a solid defensive move, preventing a potential back-rank mate.
*   **c5c4** challenges the center.
*   **d5c4** also challenges the center and opens the diagonal for the bishop.
*   **b7b6** or **a7a6** are also good pawn moves to protect the king.

I think I will play **h7h6** to solidify the defense.

Okay, I have a few options. I see I can develop my knight, push pawns, or move my rook.

Let's consider a few options:

*   **Developing the knight:** `b8c6` looks like a solid developing move.
*   **Pawn pushes:** Pushing pawns like `e7e6` or `d7d6` is a standard way to control the center.

I think developing the knight is a good, solid move to start.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, I have a good list of moves. Let's consider the options.

*   **Pawn moves:** Pushing pawns is always a good starting point. `h7h6`, `g7g6`, `f7f6`, `e7e6`, `d7d6`, `b7b6`, `a7a6` are all solid, controlling squares and preparing for development. `h7h5`, `g7g5`, `f7f5`, `e7e5`, `d7d5`, `b7b5`, `a7a5` are more aggressive, challenging the center.
*   **Knight moves:** `g8h6` and `g8f6` are the knight moves. `g8f6` is a standard developing move, controlling important central squares. `g8h6` is less common, but can be useful in certain positions.
*   **Rook moves:** `a8b8` is the only rook move, which doesn't seem particularly useful at this stage.
*   **Bishop moves:** `c6b8`, `c6e5`, `c6a5`, `c6d4`, `c6b4` are the bishop moves. `c6b8` is a developing move. `c6e5` is a more aggressive move, attacking the center. `c6a5`, `c6d4`, `c6b4` are less common.

Considering the position, I think the best move is to develop the knight to a good square and control the center.

*   **Pawn moves:** I have a lot of pawn moves available. Pushing pawns in the center seems like a good idea to control the board.
*   **Bishop moves:** My dark-squared bishop has a few options, but they don't seem immediately impactful.
*   **Rook moves:** The rook on a8 has one move.
*   **King moves:** The king has one move.
*   **Knight moves:** The knight on c6 has a few options.

I'll start by developing a pawn in the center. I'll play **d7d6**. This supports the e5 pawn and prepares for further development.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, I have a lot of options. White's queen is a threat, and I need to address that. Let's consider a few moves:

*   **...Qe7:** This develops my queen, defends the king, and potentially prepares to challenge the center.
*   **...Be7:** This also defends the king and develops a piece.
*   **...h6:** This prevents a potential white knight jump to g5, which could be annoying.
*   **...d5:** This challenges the center and opens lines for my pieces.

I think ...Qe7 is a good developing move that addresses the immediate threat.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, that's a lot of moves. Let's analyze them.

*   **King moves:** e8f8, e8d7, e8g8 - These seem passive.
*   **Rook moves:** h8g8, h8f8, a8c8, a8b8 - These don't immediately develop or defend anything critical.
*   **Queen moves:** d8c8, d8b8, d8d7 - The Queen is currently blocked, so these moves don't seem very useful.
*   **Bishop moves:** f6g8, f6d7, f6h5, f6d5, f6g4, f6e4, f5c8, f5d7, f5g6, f5e6, f5g4, f5e4, f5h3, f5d3, f5c2, f5b1 - The Bishop on f5 is a key piece. Moving it is important. f5e4 seems interesting, attacking the white queen.
*   **Pawn moves:** h7h6, g7g6, b7b6, a7a6, d6d5, e5f4, e5d4, h7h5, g7g5, b7b5, a7a5, e5e4 - e5e4 looks like a good move, opening the position and attacking the white queen.

I think the best move here is to attack the White Queen and open up the position.

*   **h8g8, h8f8, e8f8, e8d7, d8c8, d8b8, d8d7, a8c8, a8b8, e7f8:** These are King and Rook moves. I don't want to move my King into a more exposed position right now. Rook moves are also not a priority.
*   **f6g8, f6d7, f6h5, f6d5, f6g4:** These are Knight moves. The knight on f6 is well positioned. Moving it to g8 or d7 doesn't seem to help much. f6h5 looks interesting, attacking the white pawn on g3. f6d5 is also interesting, controlling the center. f6g4 is not good.
*   **f5c8, f5d7, f5g6, f5e6, f5g4, f5h3:** These are Bishop moves. My bishop on f5 is also well positioned. Moving it to c8 or d7 doesn't seem to help much. f5g6, f5e6, f5g4, f5h3 are not good.
*   **e8g8:** This is a King move. I don't want to move my King into a more exposed position right now.
*   **h7h6, g7g6, b7b6, a7a6, d6d5:** These are pawn moves. Pushing h7h6 or g7g6 is a good idea to protect my king. b7b6 and a7a6 are also good. d6d5 is a good move to control the center.
*   **e4e3:** This is a pawn move.
*   **h7h5, g7g5, b7b5, a7a5:** These are pawn moves. Pushing h7h5 or g7g5 is a good idea to protect my king. b7b5 and a7a5 are also good.

I think the best move here is to develop my Knight and attack the white pawn on g3. This will also help to protect my king.

Alright, I have a lot of options. White's attack is the priority. Let's consider a few moves:

*   **...e8d7:** This develops the Queen and gets it off the back rank, potentially defending the King and preparing to counterattack.
*   **...h7h6:** This prevents a potential White Bishop sacrifice on g7.
*   **...g7g6:** This supports the f5 Bishop and prepares to develop the Knight.
*   **...e7f6:** This is an interesting move, developing the Bishop and potentially opening the diagonal for the Queen.

Considering the immediate threat and the need to develop, I think **...e8d7** is the most solid move. It develops the Queen to a more active square and helps defend the King.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, I've got a lot of options. White's queen is a major threat, and I need to find a way to deal with it.

*   **Defensive Moves:** Moves like `h7h6`, `f7f6`, `b7b6`, `a7a6`, `d6d5`, `f7f5`, `b7b5`, `a7a5` are all passive and don't really address the immediate threats.
*   **King Moves:** Moving the king with `e7f8`, `e7f6`, `e7g5`, `e7h4` is risky and doesn't really improve the position.
*   **Queen Moves:** Moving the queen with `d8g8`, `d8f8`, `d8e8`, `d8c8`, `d8b8`, `a8c8`, `a8b8` is also not ideal.
*   **Bishop Moves:** `h5f6`, `h5f4`, `h5g3` are interesting, but don't seem to help much.
*   **Pawn Moves:** `e4f3`, `e4e3` don't seem to help.
*   **Knight Moves:** `g6f5` seems like a good developing move, attacking the white queen.

I think the best move here is to develop my knight to f6, attacking the white queen and forcing it to move. This also helps defend my king.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, I have a good list of legal moves. Let's analyze a bit. The most common opening moves for Black involve developing pieces and controlling the center.

*   **Pawn Moves:** Pushing the pawns in front of the pieces (h7h6, g7g6, f7f6, etc.) is a solid way to start, but doesn't immediately challenge the center.
*   **Knight Moves:** Developing the knights (g8f6, g8h6, b8c6, b8a6) is a good idea. Nf6 is a standard developing move.
*   **Bishop Moves:** Moving the bishop (f8e7, f8d6, etc.) can be useful, but it's often better to develop knights first.
*   **Queen Moves:** Moving the queen (d8e7, d8f6, etc.) too early is usually not a good idea.

Considering the options, I'll develop my knight to f6, a standard and solid developing move.

*   **Bishop moves:** The bishop on f8 has several options.
*   **Queen moves:** The queen has several options.
*   **King moves:** The king has one option.

I think a good developing move here is to develop the knight to c6. It controls central squares and prepares to challenge white's control of the center.

Alright, that's a lot of moves. Let's analyze. I see a few options.

*   **...h7h6** or **...h7h5**: These are standard pawn moves, controlling the g5 square.
*   **...e7d6, ...e7c5, ...e7b4**: These are interesting bishop moves. The bishop on f6 is currently blocked by the pawn on e7.
*   **...f6g8, ...f6h5, ...f6d5, ...f6g4, ...f6e4**: These are knight moves. The knight on f6 has a lot of options.
*   **...d7d6, ...d7d5**: These are pawn moves.
*   **...g7g6, ...g7g5**: These are pawn moves.
*   **...b7b6, ...b7b5**: These are pawn moves.
*   **...a7a6, ...a7a5**: These are pawn moves.

I think I'll develop my knight. Let's move the knight from f6 to h5.

Alright, I have a good number of options. Let's analyze a few of the most promising ones.

*   **...e8e7:** This seems like a solid developing move, getting the queen off the back rank and potentially preparing for further development.
*   **...d7d5:** This challenges the center and opens lines for my pieces. This is a very common and strong response in many openings.
*   **...g7g5:** This is a more aggressive move, potentially aiming to control the center and create weaknesses in White's pawn structure.
*   **...h7h6:** This is a passive move, but it might be necessary to prevent a potential attack on the g7 pawn.

Considering the position, I think challenging the center is a good approach. I'll play ...d7d5.

You are a professional chess player and you play as black. Now is your turn to make a move. Before making a move you can pick one of the following actions:
- 'get_current_board' to get the schema and current status of the board
- 'get_legal_moves' to get a UCI formatted list of available moves
- 'make_move <UCI formatted move>' when you are ready to complete your turn (e.g., 'make_move e2e4')

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Okay, I have a lot of options. Let's break this down.

*   **Developing Moves:** `h8g8`, `h8f8`, `e8f8`, `e8d7`, `d8e7`, `d8d7`, `c8d7`, `c8e6`, `c8f5`, `c8g4`, `c8h3`, `a8b8`, `f6e7`, `f6g5`, `f6h4`, `c6b8`, `c6e7`, `c6a5`, `c6d4`, `c6b4` - These are all good for development.
*   **Pawn Moves:** `h7h6`, `g7g6`, `b7b6`, `a7a6`, `h7h5`, `g7g5`, `b7b5` - These are mostly pawn moves that can control the center.
*   **Other Moves:** `e8g8`, `e5d4`, `e5e4` - These are less relevant.

I want to develop my pieces and challenge the center. The move `...e7` seems like a good developing move. I will play `e7`.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, I have a list of legal moves. Let's consider the options.

*   **Pawn moves:** Pushing pawns seems like a reasonable starting point. I see options like ...h7, ...g6, ...f6, ...e6, ...c6, ...b6, ...a6, ...h5, ...f5, ...e5, ...c5, ...b5, ...a5. These are mostly developing moves, controlling squares and preparing for the middlegame.
*   **Knight moves:** ...Nf6, ...Nd7, ...Nc6, ...Na6. ...Nf6 is a standard developing move, controlling central squares. The other knight moves are less appealing at this stage.
*   **Queen moves:** ...Qd7, ...Qd6. These moves are not available.
*   **Bishop moves:** ...Bd7, ...Be6, ...Bf5, ...Bg4, ...Bh3. These are developing moves, but some of them might be premature.
*   **King moves:** No king moves are available.
*   **Rook moves:** No rook moves are available.

Considering the position, I think developing the knight to f6 is a solid, standard move. It controls important central squares and prepares for further development.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, I have a lot of options. Let's analyze the position. White has a strong center with the pawn on d4. Black needs to develop pieces and challenge the center.

*   **Pawn moves:** Pushing the pawns on the kingside (h7, g6, h5) seems premature. e6 looks solid. c6 and b6 are also reasonable.
*   **Knight moves:** ...Nc6 develops a piece and challenges the center. ...Nd7 is also possible, but less active.
*   **Queen moves:** ...Qd7 is a developing move, but doesn't immediately threaten anything.
*   **Bishop moves:** ...Bg4 attacks the knight and pins it to the queen. This looks interesting. ...Be6 is also a developing move.
*   **Rook moves:** No immediate rook moves are useful.

I like the idea of developing the bishop to g4 to put pressure on white's knight.

*   **...h7:** This seems like a solid, developing move, preventing any potential back-rank issues.
*   **...e7e5:** This challenges the center and opens lines for my queen and bishop. It's a more aggressive approach.
*   **...b8c6:** This develops the knight and prepares to challenge the center.
*   **...d8d7:** This develops the queen and prepares to challenge the center.

I think I like the idea of challenging the center. I'll go with ...e7e5.

Okay, I see the board. White has a strong center, and my king is a bit exposed. I need to develop my pieces and challenge white's control of the center. Let's see what my legal moves are.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, I have a lot of options. Let's break this down.

*   **King moves:** e8e7, e8d7 - Moving the king doesn't seem immediately necessary.
*   **Queen moves:** d8c8, d8e7, d8d7, d8d6 - The queen is important, but I don't want to develop it too early and make it a target.
*   **Bishop moves:** f8e7, f8d6, f8c5, f8b4, f8a3, g4c8, g4d7, g4e6, g4h5, g4f5, g4h3, g4f3, g4e2 - The bishop on f8 is blocked. The bishop on g4 is interesting, but I want to develop my other pieces first.
*   **Knight moves:** h8g8, h8h7, b8d7, b8c6, b8a6, f6g8, f6h7, f6d7, f6h5, f6e4 - The knight on b8 is blocked. The knight on f6 is more active.
*   **Pawn moves:** h6g5, e5d4, g7g6, c7c6, b7b6, a7a6, h6h5, e5e4, c7c5, b7b5, a7a5, - Pawn moves are important for controlling the center and developing.

I like the idea of developing my knight on f6. The move **f6e4** attacks the center and opens up the diagonal for my bishop on f8. It also challenges white's pawn on d4.

Alright, a lot of options. Let's consider a few.

*   **...Qd7:** Develops the queen to a more active square and potentially eyes the weak pawn on f2.
*   **...Bg7:** Develops the bishop, preparing for kingside castling.
*   **...h5:** A pawn push to challenge white's control of the g4 square.
*   **...f5:** A pawn push to challenge white's control of the e4 square.

I like the idea of developing the queen and putting some pressure on white's position. I'll go with ...Qd7.

The queen is indeed under attack. I see a few options. Moving the queen is the most obvious, but I need to consider the best square. Defending with the bishop on f8 is also an option. Let's see...

*   **h8g8:** Moves the rook, but doesn't address the immediate threat.
*   **h8h7:** Moves the rook, but doesn't address the immediate threat.
*   **f8e7:** Develops the bishop and defends the queen. This looks promising.
*   **f8d6:** Develops the bishop, but doesn't defend the queen.
*   **f8c5:** Develops the bishop, but doesn't defend the queen.
*   **f8b4:** Develops the bishop, but doesn't defend the queen.
*   **f8a3:** Develops the bishop, but doesn't defend the queen.
*   **e8d8:** Moves the king, which is not necessary right now.
*   **b8c6:** Develops the knight, but doesn't address the immediate threat.
*   **b8a6:** Develops the knight, but doesn't address the immediate threat.
*   **d7d8:** Moves the queen, but doesn't address the immediate threat.
*   **d7c8:** Moves the queen, but doesn't address the immediate threat.
*   **d7e7:** Moves the queen, but doesn't address the immediate threat.
*   **d7e6:** Moves the queen, but doesn't address the immediate threat.
*   **d7d6:** Moves the queen, but doesn't address the immediate threat.
*   **d7c6:** Moves the queen, but doesn't address the immediate threat.
*   **d7f5:** Moves the queen, but doesn't address the immediate threat.
*   **d7b5:** Moves the queen, but doesn't address the immediate threat.
*   **d7a4:** Moves the queen, but doesn't address the immediate threat.
*   **g4e6:** Develops the knight, but doesn't address the immediate threat.
*   **g4h5:** Develops the knight, but doesn't address the immediate threat.
*   **g4f5:** Develops the knight, but doesn't address the immediate threat.
*   **g4h3:** Develops the knight, but doesn't address the immediate threat.
*   **g4f3:** Develops the knight, but doesn't address the immediate threat.
*   **g4e2:** Develops the knight, but doesn't address the immediate threat.
*   **e4f6:** Develops the knight, but doesn't address the immediate threat.
*   **e4d6:** Develops the knight, but doesn't address the immediate threat.
*   **e4g5:** Develops the knight, but doesn't address the immediate threat.
*   **e4c5:** Develops the knight, but doesn't address the immediate threat.
*   **e4g3:** Develops the knight, but doesn't address the immediate threat.
*   **e4c3:** Develops the knight, but doesn't address the immediate threat.
*   **e4f2:** Develops the knight, but doesn't address the immediate threat.
*   **e4d2:** Develops the knight, but doesn't address the immediate threat.
*   **e5d4:** Moves the pawn, but doesn't address the immediate threat.
*   **g7g6:** Moves the pawn, but doesn't address the immediate threat.
*   **f7f6:** Moves the pawn, but doesn't address the immediate threat.
*   **c7c6:** Moves the pawn, but doesn't address the immediate threat.
*   **b7b6:** Moves the pawn, but doesn't address the immediate threat.
*   **a7a6:** Moves the pawn, but doesn't address the immediate threat.
*   **h6h5:** Moves the pawn, but doesn't address the immediate threat.
*   **g7g5:** Moves the pawn, but doesn't address the immediate threat.
*   **f7f5:** Moves the pawn, but doesn't address the immediate threat.
*   **c7c5:** Moves the pawn, but doesn't address the immediate threat.
*   **b7b5:** Moves the pawn, but doesn't address the immediate threat.
*   **a7a5:** Moves the pawn, but doesn't address the immediate threat.

Moving the bishop to e7 seems like the best move. It defends the queen and develops a piece.

That's a lot of moves! Let's analyze the position. White seems to have a strong attack brewing, especially with the queen and bishop on the kingside. Black's king is a bit exposed. I need to prioritize defense and development.

The most pressing threat seems to be the white queen and bishop aiming at the black king. I need to find a move that addresses this.

Looking at the available moves, I see a few options. Moving the rook on h8 seems like a good idea to defend the h-file. Moving the knight on b8 seems like a good idea to develop the knight. Moving the pawn on g7 seems like a good idea to defend the king.

I think I'll move the knight to c6 to develop it and defend the king.

That's a lot of moves! White's queen is a threat, and the knight on f5 looks dangerous. I need to be careful.

Let's analyze some options:

*   **...h7:** This seems like a passive move, and doesn't address the immediate threats.
*   **...e6:** This blocks the diagonal of the white bishop on f1, and supports the pawn on d7. This looks like a solid defensive move.
*   **...g6:** This prepares to fianchetto the bishop, which could be useful. However, it doesn't address the immediate threats.
*   **...f6:** This supports the e-pawn, but doesn't seem to be the best.

I think ...e6 is the most solid move here. It defends the pawn on d7 and blocks the bishop's diagonal.

Okay, I see the board. White has a strong attack brewing, especially with the Queen and Bishop eyeing my King. I need to defend and develop my pieces. Let's see what moves are available.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, I have a lot of options. White's queen is a real threat, so I need to address that. Moving the King doesn't seem ideal right now. I see a few possibilities:

*   **Developing a piece:** Moving the Bishop on f8 to g7 (h8g7) would develop a piece and potentially help defend the King.
*   **Pawn moves:** Pushing pawns like g7g6 or f7f6 could help solidify the position.
*   **Attacking the Queen:** Moving the pawn on e6 to attack the Queen (e6f5) seems interesting.

I think the most active move is to challenge the Queen. Let's try e6f5.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Okay, I've got a lot of options. White's queen on d4 is a threat, and I need to address that. Let's analyze a few possibilities:

*   **...Qf6:** This attacks the queen and forces a trade or a retreat. It also develops my queen and opens up the f-file for my rook. This looks like a good option.
*   **...e4f6:** This is a pawn sacrifice that opens the f-file. It could be interesting, but it leaves my king a bit exposed.
*   **...g7g6:** This supports the f7 pawn and prepares to move the knight.

I think Qf6 is the most active and direct response. I'll go with that.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Okay, I have a lot of options. Let's analyze the most pressing issues. White's queen on d4 is a threat. Black's knight on f6 is also under attack. I need to address these issues.

*   **h8g8, h8f8, h8h7, e8f8, e8d8, a8d8, a8c8, a8b8:** These are rook and king moves. They don't immediately address the threats.
*   **f6d8, f6e7, f6g5, f6h4:** Knight moves. f6e7 looks interesting, getting the knight out of the pin and potentially supporting a pawn advance.
*   **f5c8, f5h7, f5d7, f5g6, f5e6, f5h5, f5g5, f5f4:** Bishop moves.
*   **g4h5, g4h3, g4f3, g4e2, g4d1:** Queen moves.
*   **e4d6, e4g5, e4c5, e4g3, e4c3, e4f2, e4d2:** Queen moves.
*   **e8g8:** King move.
*   **c7b6, a7b6, e5f4, e5d4, g7g6, a7a6, h6h5, g7g5, a7a5:** Pawn moves.

The most critical threat is the white queen on d4. I need to move my knight to safety and develop a piece. The move **f6e7** seems like the best option. It gets the knight out of the pin, develops it to a more active square, and potentially prepares for a pawn advance.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, that's a lot of moves. Let's analyze. White seems to be threatening a lot, especially with the Queen and Knights. I need to defend and develop.

*   **Pawn Moves:** Moving pawns on the h-file (h8h7, h6h5) doesn't seem to help much. g7g6 and g7g5 are options, but they weaken the kingside. a7a6 and a7a5 are also possible, but don't address the immediate threats. f7f6 is a solid move.
*   **Bishop Moves:** The Bishop on f5 has a lot of options. Moving it to a square like g6 or h7 could be useful to defend.
*   **Knight Moves:** The Knight on e4 has many moves, but none of them seem to immediately help.
*   **Queen Moves:** The Queen has a lot of moves, but none of them seem to immediately help.
*   **King Moves:** The King has limited moves, but none of them seem to immediately help.
*   **Rook Moves:** The Rooks on a8 and h8 have many moves, but none of them seem to immediately help.

I think the most pressing issue is the potential attack on my King. I need to develop my pieces and try to control the center. I'll move my Bishop to g6 to defend the h7 square and potentially control the long diagonal.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, that's a lot of moves. Let's analyze the most critical ones.

*   **Defensive:** I need to consider moves that improve my king's safety. `h8g8` and `h8f8` are tempting to move the rook, but they don't immediately address the threat.
*   **Development:** Developing pieces is important. `e7d6` looks interesting, developing the pawn and potentially opening lines for my bishop.
*   **Counterplay:** I need to find ways to create counterplay. `c6d4` could challenge white's center.
*   **Tactical considerations:** I need to be aware of any immediate threats or opportunities.

After careful consideration, I'll choose to develop my pawn and open the diagonal for my bishop.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Okay, that's a lot of moves. Let's analyze the most critical ones. White seems to be targeting my kingside. I need to consider how to defend and develop my pieces.

*   **h8g8, h8f8, h8h7:** Moving the rook doesn't seem to immediately address the threat.
*   **e8f8, e8d8:** Moving the king is risky, but might be necessary later.
*   **f6d8, f6g7, f6e7, f6e6, f6g5, f6f5, f6h4, f6f4, f6f3, f6f2:** The knight moves are interesting. Developing the knight is good.
*   **d6f8, d6e7, d6c5, d6b4:** The bishop moves are also good for development.
*   **c6d8, c6b8, c6e7, c6a5, c6d4, c6b4:** The queen moves are a bit passive right now.
*   **g4c8, g4d7, g4e6, g4h5, g4f5, g4h3, g4f3, g4e2, g4d1:** The knight moves are good.
*   **e4g5, e4c5, e4g3, e4c3, e4f2, e4d2:** The knight moves are good.
*   **e8g8:** Moving the king is risky, but might be necessary later.
*   **c7b6, b7a6, a7b6:** The pawn moves don't seem to help much.
*   **g6h5, e5d4, d5c4, g6g5:** The pawn moves don't seem to help much.

I think developing the knight is a good idea. I'll move the knight to e7. This defends the king and prepares to challenge the center.

Alright, that's a lot of moves. White is clearly threatening a checkmate. I need to prioritize defending my king.

*   **h8g8, h8f8, h8h7, e8f8, e8d8, a8d8, a8c8, a8b8:** These are rook and king moves. I don't see any immediate threats that these moves address.
*   **f6d8, f6g7, f6e7, f6e6, f6g5, f6f5, f6h4, f6f4, f6f3, f6f2:** Knight moves. Some of these might be useful for developing the knight, but don't seem to address the immediate threat.
*   **d6f8, d6e7, d6c5, d6b4:** Bishop moves. These don't seem to help much.
*   **c6d8, c6b8, c6e7, c6a5, c6d4, c6b4:** Queen moves. Some of these look interesting.
*   **g4c8, g4d7, g4e6, g4h5, g4f5, g4h3, g4f3, g4e2, g4d1:** Bishop moves. These are not helpful.
*   **e4g5, e4c5, e4g3, e4c3, e4f2, e4d2:** Knight moves. These are not helpful.

*   **c7b6, b7a6, a7b6:** Pawn moves. These don't help.
*   **g6h5, e5d4, d5c4, g6g5:** Pawn moves. These don't help.

The most promising move seems to be to move the queen to defend. **c6d4** looks like the best move. It defends the king and develops the queen.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Okay, I have the legal moves. White is threatening to win material or launch a strong attack. I need to find a move that addresses these threats and develops my pieces.

*   **h8g8, h8f8, h8e8, h8h7**: Moving the rook doesn't seem to help much in the current situation.
*   **d8e8, d8e7, d8d7**: Moving the queen is tempting, but it might make the king even more vulnerable.
*   **f6g7, f6e7, f6e6, f6g5, f6f5, f6h4, f6f4, f6f3, f6f2**: The knight moves are interesting.
*   **d6f8, d6e7, d6c5, d6b4**: The bishop moves are also worth considering.
*   **g4c8, g4d7, g4e6, g4h5, g4f5, g4h3, g4f3, g4e2, g4d1**: The bishop moves are also worth considering.
*   **e4g5, e4c5, e4g3, e4c3, e4f2, e4d2**: The knight moves are interesting.
*   **d4e6, d4c6, d4f5, d4b5, d4f3, d4b3, d4e2, d4c2**: The knight moves are interesting.
*   **g6h5**: Weakens the pawn structure.
*   **d5c4**: Doesn't seem to improve the position.
*   **c7c6, a7a6, g6g5, c7c5, a7a5**: Pawn moves are not the priority right now.

I think the knight on f6 is the most active piece. I'll try to develop it to a more active square. **Nf6e4** looks like a good move. It attacks the white knight and opens up a line for the queen.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, I have a few options. I see my knight on f6 has several moves. I also see pawn moves available. Let's consider a few possibilities.

*   **Developing the knight:** Moving the knight to g8 (h8g8) doesn't seem very active. Moving it to h5 (f6h5) attacks the white knight, which could be interesting. Moving it to d5 (f6d5) controls the center, which is often a good idea. Moving it to e4 (f6e4) attacks the center and the white pawn on f2, but it leaves the knight vulnerable.
*   **Pawn moves:** Pushing a pawn seems less critical at this stage.

I think developing the knight to d5 is the most solid and active move. It challenges the center and prepares for further development.

*   **Pawn moves:** Pushing pawns is generally good to control the center and develop. I see a lot of pawn moves available.
*   **Knight moves:** The knight on b8 has several options.
*   **Bishop moves:** The bishop on c8 has a few options.
*   **Rook moves:** The rook on a8 has no moves.
*   **Queen moves:** The queen on d8 has no moves.
*   **King moves:** The king on e8 has no moves.

I'm leaning towards developing a piece and controlling the center. I like the idea of developing the knight to c6. It controls important squares and prepares for further development.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Okay, I've reviewed the legal moves. The position is a bit closed, and Black needs to develop pieces and find a plan.

The Queen on d8 is a good starting point. I see a few options:

*   **...Bg7:** Develops the bishop and prepares to fianchetto.
*   **...Qe7:** Develops the queen to a more active square.
*   **...Nf6:** Develops the knight.

I like the idea of developing the bishop to g7. It controls the long diagonal and can support an advance on the kingside later.

Therefore, I will move the bishop from f8 to g7.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, I have a list of legal moves. Let's analyze them.

The most common opening moves for black in this position are to develop a knight or push a pawn. I see several options for both.

*   **Knight Development:** `b8c6` looks like a solid developing move, controlling central squares.
*   **Pawn Moves:** Pushing pawns like `h7h6`, `g7g6`, `d7d6`, `c7c6`, `b7b6`, `a7a6` are all possible, but I want to be careful not to weaken my pawn structure too early.

Considering the position, I think developing the knight is the most principled move. It develops a piece, controls central squares, and prepares for further development.

Therefore, I will move the knight to c6.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, I have a good number of moves to consider. White seems to be controlling the center. I need to develop my pieces and challenge that control.

Let's look at some options:

*   **Developing moves:** `h8g8` (moving the rook) doesn't seem immediately useful. `c6b8` (moving the knight) is also not great.
*   **Pawn moves:** Pushing pawns like `h7h6`, `g7g6`, etc., are okay, but don't immediately improve my position.
*   **King moves:** `e7f6`, `e7e6`, `e7d6` are not good as they expose the king.

I think the best move here is to develop the knight. `g4f6` looks like a good developing move, putting the knight in a central position and attacking the pawn on e4.

The position is relatively closed. White has a pawn on e5, controlling the center. Black needs to develop pieces and challenge White's control.

I like the idea of developing the knight on f6. The move **f6d5** looks interesting. It attacks the center and opens up the diagonal for the queen.

Therefore, I will make the move f6d5.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Okay, I have a lot of options. Let's analyze them.

*   **Developing the Bishop:** `f8e7`, `f8d6`, `f8c5`, `f8b4`, `f8a3` are all options for developing the dark-squared bishop. `f8e7` is a solid developing move, but doesn't immediately challenge anything. `f8d6` looks interesting, aiming at the center and potentially putting pressure on the e5 pawn. `f8c5` and the other diagonal moves are less appealing at the moment.
*   **Queen moves:** `d8e7`, `d8f6`, `d8g5`, `d8h4` are all options for the queen. `d8e7` is a standard developing move, but doesn't immediately threaten anything. `d8f6` could be interesting, but it might be a bit premature.
*   **Rook moves:** `a8b8` is a passive move.
*   **Pawn moves:** `e6e7`, `e6f6`, `e6d6`, `h7h6`, `g7g6`, `f7f6`, `d7d6`, `b7b6`, `a7a6`, `h7h5`, `g7g5`, `f7f5`, `b7b5`, `a7a5` are all pawn moves. Pushing pawns is generally good, but I need to be careful not to weaken my position.
*   **Knight moves:** `c6b8`, `c6e7`, `c6a5`, `c6d4`, `c6b4` are knight moves. `c6d4` looks interesting, attacking the center.

I like the idea of developing the dark-squared bishop and challenging the center. I also like the knight move to d4. Let's try `c6d4`.

e6e7,e6f6,e6d6,d4f5,f7f5

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Okay, I have a few options.

*   **e6e7:** This looks like a tempting pawn push, but it doesn't really help with the immediate threats and could potentially open up the king further.
*   **e6f6:** This is a knight move, but it doesn't seem to improve the position.
*   **e6d6:** This is a knight move, but it doesn't seem to improve the position.
*   **d4f5:** This is a knight move, but it doesn't seem to improve the position.
*   **f7f5:** This pawn push seems like the most active move. It challenges white's control of the center and opens a line for the bishop on c8.

I think **f7f5** is the best move here. It's active, develops a pawn, and challenges white's control of the center.

*   **Rook moves:** The rooks have limited options.
*   **Bishop moves:** The bishops have some diagonal movement possibilities.
*   **Pawn moves:** Pawn moves are important for controlling the center and developing pieces.

Considering the position, I want to develop a piece and try to control the center. The move ...d7-d6 looks like a solid developing move, supporting the e6 pawn and preparing to challenge white's control of the center.

*   **...e6f7, e6e7, e6d7, e6f6:** These are pawn moves. Pushing the e-pawn is tempting to challenge the center.
*   **...d5e7, d5f6, d5b6, d5f4, d5b4, d5e3, d5c3:** These are knight moves. The knight on d5 is well-placed.
*   **...d4c6, d4b5, d4f3, d4b3, d4e2, d4c2:** These are knight moves. The knight on d4 is well-placed.
*   **...f5g4, h7h6, g7g6, c7c6, b7b6, a7a6, h7h5, g7g5, c7c5, b7b5, a7a5:** These are pawn moves.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, I have a lot of options. Let's analyze them:

*   **Queen moves (d8...):** The queen is under attack and needs to move. Moving the queen to d7 seems like the most sensible option, as it keeps the queen active and defends the pawn on e7.
*   **Rook moves (a8... h8...):** These moves don't seem to improve the position immediately.
*   **Pawn moves:** Pushing pawns on the kingside (h7, g7) or the queenside (a7, b7, c7) is a standard way to develop. However, these moves don't address the immediate threat.
*   **Bishop moves (f5...):** The bishop on f5 has some interesting options. Moving it to g4 attacks the white queen, but it can be easily defended. Moving it to e4 or f4 doesn't seem to improve the position.
*   **Knight moves (e6...):** The knight on e6 has a few options, but none of them seem particularly strong.

Considering the position, the most pressing issue is the white queen's threat. Moving the queen to d7 seems like the best move to develop the queen, defend the pawn on e7, and prepare for further development.

Alright, that's a lot of moves. The immediate threat seems to be the white queen on g7. I need to address that. Let's look at the options:

*   **Defensive moves:** Many moves defend the king, but don't immediately address the queen.
*   **Attacking moves:** Some moves attack the queen, but might leave the king vulnerable.

I think the best move is to develop the knight and attack the queen.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, that's a lot of moves. Let's analyze the most critical ones first, focusing on the immediate threat to the King.

*   **h8g8:** Moving the Rook to g8 doesn't directly address the attack.
*   **e7e8, e7d8, e7f7, d7e8, d7d8, d7c8, d7c6, d7b5, d7a4:** These are all pawn moves. None of these moves seem to help the immediate threat.
*   **f6g8, f6e8, f6h5, f6d5, f6g4, f6e4:** These are knight moves. The knight on f6 is well-placed. Moving it to g8 or e8 is not helpful. Moving it to h5, d5, g4, or e4 doesn't seem to directly address the threat.
*   **e6g8, e6f7, e6d5, e6c4, e6b3:** These are bishop moves. Moving the bishop on e6 doesn't seem to help.
*   **d4c6, d4b5, d4f3, d4b3, d4e2, d4c2:** These are pawn moves. None of these moves seem to help the immediate threat.
*   **f5g4, f5e4:** These are pawn moves. None of these moves seem to help the immediate threat.
*   **h7h6, g7g6, c7c6, b7b6, a7a6, d6d5, f5f4, h7h5, g7g5, c7c5, b7b5, a7a5:** These are pawn moves. None of these moves seem to help the immediate threat.

It seems there is no immediate way to block the attack. The best move here is to try to defend the king. The queen on d4 is the biggest threat. Moving the queen to safety is the best option.

*   **Attacking moves:** I could try to attack the Queen, but that might lead to a worse position.
*   **Developing moves:** Some pawn moves are available, but they don't seem to help immediately.

Looking at the list, I see I can move the Queen to g8. This seems like the best option to protect the King and develop the Queen.

Alright, a lot of options. White's Queen is a real threat. I need to consider the following:

*   **Defense:** Protecting the King is paramount.
*   **Development:** Getting my pieces into the game.
*   **Counterplay:** Finding ways to create threats of my own.

Let's analyze some of the moves:

*   **...Qe8:** This seems like a reasonable defensive move, getting the Queen out of the line of fire and potentially connecting the rooks.
*   **...Nf6:** This develops the knight, but it doesn't immediately address the threat.
*   **...h6:** This prevents a potential g5-g6 push by white.
*   **...c6:** This supports the pawn structure.
*   **...d5:** This challenges the center.

Considering the immediate threat and the need for development, I'm leaning towards ...Qe8. It defends the king and prepares to connect the rooks.

*   **Defensive options:** Moving the King (e8d8, e8c8) seems like a good idea to get it out of the center.
*   **Developing options:** I could try to develop the Knight (f6h5, f6d5, f6g4, f6e4), but it doesn't seem to immediately address the threat.
*   **Pawn moves:** Pushing pawns doesn't seem to help the situation.

Moving the King seems like the most prudent move. I'll move the King to d8.

Alright, I have a lot of options. White's queen is a threat, and I need to address that. I also need to develop my pieces to counterattack.

*   **Defensive Considerations:** Moving the queen is tempting, but it doesn't immediately solve the problem. Moving the king is also not a good option.
*   **Development:** Developing the knight on f6 seems like a good idea.

I'll develop the knight to defend the king and prepare for potential counterplay.

Alright, I have a lot of options. White's queen on d8 is a major threat. I need to consider how to defend against that.

*   **...Qe8** (d8e8): This seems like the most direct defense, blocking the queen's attack on the king. However, it also allows White to develop their rook on f1.
*   **...Qc8, Qb8, Qa8**: These moves also defend the king, but they don't seem to improve the position significantly.
*   **...h6, g6, c6, b6, a6:** These pawn moves are passive and don't address the immediate threats.
*   **...e8, f7, f6, e8, c8, c6, b5, a4, f7, d5, c4, b3, f6, f4, g3, d4, b4, e3, a3, e1, a1, e4, h6, g6, c6, b6, a6, d5, f4, g5, c5, b5, a5:** These moves are also passive and don't address the immediate threats.

Considering the position, I think the best move is to defend the king directly and develop a piece. ...Qe8 seems like the most logical move.

Alright, I've reviewed the legal moves. White's queen is a serious threat, and we need to address it. The most pressing concern is the immediate threat to the king.

Let's consider the possible moves. Moving the king is an option, but it doesn't solve the underlying problem. Developing pieces seems less important than immediate safety.

The move that seems most promising is to try to block the queen's attack. I will move the pawn on e7 to f6, blocking the queen's attack on the king.

Alright, I've got a lot of options. White's queen on d4 is a major threat. I need to consider how to defend against that.

*   **Developing moves:** f8e7 develops the bishop, but doesn't immediately address the threat.
*   **Pawn moves:** Pushing pawns doesn't seem to help much in the short term.
*   **King moves:** Moving the king is risky with the open files.

The most pressing issue is the queen on d4. I think I need to try to trade it. The best move seems to be to move the queen to a position where it can attack the white queen.

I'll move my queen to d8. This attacks the white queen and forces a trade or a retreat.

Okay, I have a lot of options. Let's analyze.

*   **Queen moves:** The queen on d8 has many options, but moving it now might be premature.
*   **Bishop moves:** The bishop on f8 has a few options, but none seem immediately impactful. The bishop on e6 has a lot of potential, but I need to be careful.
*   **Pawn moves:** I have a lot of pawn moves available. Pushing pawns is often a good way to develop.
*   **Knight moves:** The knight on h5 has a few options, but none look particularly strong right now.

The position is complex. I'm going to focus on development and control of the center. I think pushing the pawn on g7 to g6 is a solid developing move that also prevents a potential knight jump to f5.

Okay, I see the board. White has a strong attack developing, especially with the Queen and Rook on the open files. Black's King is somewhat exposed. I need to defend and develop. Let's get the legal moves.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, I have a lot of options. White's threat is immediate, so I need to address it. The most pressing issue is the attack on my King. I see a few defensive options, but I need to prioritize.

*   **...Qd8** defends the King directly.
*   **...Bg7** develops a piece and blocks the attack.
*   **...Qe7** also defends the King.

I think ...Qd8 is the most solid move, directly defending the King. Let's make that move.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, I have a lot of options. Let's analyze them:

*   **King moves:** `e8e7` looks like a reasonable escape route, but it might not be the best.
*   **Queen moves:** `d8c8`, `d8b8`, `d8a8`, `d8e7`, `d8d7` are all possibilities, but I need to see if they help.
*   **Pawn moves:** Several pawn moves are available. I'll need to evaluate which ones are best.
*   **Bishop moves:** `f8g7`, `f8e7`, `f8h6`, `e6c8`, `e6f7`, `e6d7`, `e6f5`, `e6d5`, `e6c4`, `e6b3` are all options.
*   **Knight moves:** `g8h8`, `g8g7`, `h5g7`, `h5f4`, `h5g3` are available.

The immediate threat is the attack on my king. I need to find a move that defends against this.

I see that white has a strong attack on the kingside. I think the best move here is to move my queen to a safe square and develop my pieces.

I'll move my queen to d7. This defends the king and opens up the diagonal for my bishop.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, I've got a lot of options. Let's analyze.

*   **Pawn moves:** Pushing the pawns seems like a good start to control the center and develop. `h7h6`, `g7g6`, `e7e6`, `b7b6`, `a7a6` are all possible. `h7h5`, `e7e5`, `b7b5`, `a7a5` are more aggressive.
*   **Bishop moves:** The bishops have some diagonals open. `c8d7`, `c8e6`, `c8f5`, `c8g4`, `c8h3` are options for the dark-squared bishop.
*   **Knight moves:** The knight on f6 has several moves: `f6g8`, `f6d7`, `f6h5`, `f6g4`, `f6e4`. The knight on c6 has: `c6b8`, `c6e5`, `c6a5`, `c6d4`, `c6b4`.
*   **Rook moves:** The rook on a8 has one move: `a8b8`
*   **Queen moves:** The queen has a lot of options, but it's not developed yet.
*   **King moves:** The king has no moves.

I think developing the knight is a good idea. `f6d7` looks like a solid developing move, controlling the center.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Okay, I've got the legal moves. Let's analyze them.

*   **Pawn moves:** There are a lot of pawn moves available. Pushing pawns can be useful for controlling the center and creating space, but I need to be careful not to weaken my pawn structure too much.
*   **Bishop moves:** The bishop on d7 has several diagonal options. Developing the bishop is generally a good idea.
*   **Knight moves:** The knight on c6 has a few options.
*   **Rook moves:** The rook on a8 can move to b8.

Considering the position, I think developing the bishop to a more active square is a good idea. I'll choose to develop my bishop to f6, controlling the important e5 square and preparing for potential attacks.

Alright, I have the list of legal moves. Let's analyze the position. White has developed their pieces, and I need to develop mine as well. I see a few options.

*   **Developing the Queen's Bishop:** Moves like ...Bg4 or ...Bf5 look interesting, aiming to put pressure on the kingside.
*   **Developing the Queen:** ...Qd7 or ...Qe7 are standard developing moves.
*   **Pawn Moves:** ...h6, ...g6, ...e6, ...b6, and ...a6 are all possible pawn moves to control squares and prepare for piece development.

Considering the position, I think developing the Queen's Bishop to g4 is a good developing move that also puts some pressure on the kingside.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, I've got a list of legal moves. Let's analyze them.

*   **Pawn Moves:** The pawn moves are mostly standard. I see options like h7h6, g7g6, e7e6, b7b6, a7a6, h7h5, e7e5, b7b5, a7a5. These are all reasonable developing moves, but I need to consider the overall strategy.
*   **Knight Moves:** The knights have some interesting options: f6g8, f6d7, f6h5, f6e4, c6b8, c6e5, c6a5, c6d4, c6b4. The knight on f6 is well-placed and has several good squares.
*   **Bishop Moves:** The bishop on g4 has a few options: g4c8, g4d7, g4e6, g4h5, g4f5, g4h3, g4f3, g4e2.
*   **Queen Moves:** The queen has a lot of options, but I don't want to move it too early.
*   **Rook Moves:** The rooks have limited options at the moment.
*   **King Moves:** The king has no immediate moves.

Considering the position, I think developing the knight on f6 is a good idea. The move f6e4 looks particularly interesting, as it attacks the center and opens lines for the queen and bishop.

Therefore, I will play f6e4.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

That's a lot of moves! Let's analyze the position. White has a strong center and a potentially dangerous attack brewing. I need to develop my pieces and try to create counterplay.

The most pressing issue is the potential threat to my king. I should consider moves that improve my king's safety.

*   **...h7-h6** or **...g7-g6** seem like reasonable prophylactic moves, preventing potential attacks along the h-file or g-file.
*   **...f8-e7** develops the bishop and prepares to castle. This is a good developing move.
*   **...d8-e7** also develops the queen, but might be premature.

I'm leaning towards developing the bishop and improving king safety. I'll choose ...f8-e7.

Alright, I have a lot of options. Let's analyze a bit.

*   **King Safety:** My king is currently relatively safe.
*   **Development:** I have a few pieces developed, but I need to continue developing.
*   **Pawn Structure:** The pawn structure is fairly closed.
*   **Tactical Considerations:** There don't appear to be any immediate tactical threats.

Considering all of this, I'll focus on developing a piece and improving my pawn structure. The move ...h7-h6 seems solid, preventing a potential knight jump to g5 and preparing for a possible ...g7-g5 advance later.

That's a lot of moves! Let's analyze the position. White seems to have a slight space advantage, but my pieces are reasonably well-placed. I need to develop my pieces and challenge White's control of the center.

The move ...g7-g6 looks solid. It supports the pawn on h6, prepares for ...Bg7, and doesn't weaken my pawn structure.

Therefore, I will play g7-g6.

That's a lot of moves! Let's analyze.

*   **Queen moves:** The queen on d8 has many options, but I need to be careful not to expose my king.
*   **Rook moves:** The rooks on a8 and h8 have limited options right now.
*   **Knight moves:** The knight on c6 has some interesting possibilities.
*   **Pawn moves:** I have several pawn moves available.
*   **Bishop moves:** The bishop on f8 has a few options.

I'm going to focus on developing a piece and controlling the center. The knight on c6 looks like a good option. Moving it to d4 attacks the center and potentially opens lines for my queen and bishop.

White has a strong pawn center with pawns on d5 and e5. Black needs to challenge this center. The move ...c7c5 looks like a good option to challenge the center. It opens the c-file for the rook and queen, and it attacks the d5 pawn.

Therefore, I will play ...c7c5.

I think a good developing move here is to develop my bishop and put some pressure on the center. I'll move my bishop from g4 to e6. This attacks the pawn on d4 and prepares to control the center.

*   **...e7f6** or **...e7d6** are developing moves for the bishop, but don't immediately address the threat.
*   **...f5e6** or **...f5g4** are developing moves for the bishop, but don't immediately address the threat.
*   **...e5f4** or **...e5d4** are developing moves for the knight, but don't immediately address the threat.
*   **...c5d4** or **...c5b4** are developing moves for the pawn, but don't immediately address the threat.
*   **...d8d7** is a developing move for the queen, but doesn't immediately address the threat.
*   **...d8c8** is a developing move for the queen, but doesn't immediately address the threat.
*   **...d8b8** is a developing move for the queen, but doesn't immediately address the threat.
*   **...d8a5** is a developing move for the queen, but doesn't immediately address the threat.

I think the best move is to develop my queen to a safe square and prepare to counterattack. **...Qd7** seems like a solid developing move. It gets the queen off the back rank, develops it to a central square, and prepares to influence the game.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Alright, I have a lot of options. Let's analyze them:

*   **Rook moves (h8g8, h8f8, h8h7, h8h6):** These don't seem to immediately address the threats.
*   **King moves (e8f7, e8d8):** Moving the King is risky in this position.
*   **Queen moves (d7d8, d7c8, d7c7, d7e6, d7d6, d7c6, d7b5, d7a4):** The Queen is a valuable piece. Moving it to a safe square and developing it is a good idea.
*   **Bishop moves (f5e6, f5g4, f5h3):** These moves don't seem to help much.
*   **Knight moves (e4f6, e4d6, e4g5, e4g3, e4c3, e4f2, e4d2):** These moves don't seem to help much.
*   **Pawn moves (e5f4, e5d4, d5c4, c5d4, c5b4, b7b6, a7a6, g6g5, b7b5, a7a5):** Some of these pawn moves could be useful for controlling the center or preventing white from advancing.

Considering the threats, I think the best move is to develop my Queen to a safe square and put pressure on the center. **Qd7-c6** seems like a good option. It develops the Queen, attacks the center, and prepares for further development.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Okay, I have a lot of options. Let's analyze them.

*   **Rook moves:** `h8g8, h8f8, h8h7, h8h6, h8h5, h8h4, a8d8, a8c8, a8b8` - Moving the rooks doesn't seem immediately helpful. They are blocked.
*   **King moves:** `e8f8, e8f7, e8d7` - The king is relatively safe for now. Moving it doesn't seem urgent.
*   **Queen moves:** `c6c8, c6d7, c6c7, c6f6, c6e6, c6d6, c6b6, c6a6, c6b5, c6a4` - The queen is well-placed. Moving it to develop or attack is a good idea.
*   **Bishop moves:** `f5c8, f5d7, f5e6, f5g4, f5h3` - The bishop on f5 has some interesting options.
*   **Knight moves:** `e4f6, e4d6, e4g5, e4g3, e4c3, e4f2, e4d2` - The knight on e4 has many options.
*   **Pawn moves:** `b7b6, a7a6, b7b5, a7a5` - Pawn moves are generally less impactful in the opening/middlegame.

My priorities are:

1.  **Develop pieces:** Get my pieces active.
2.  **Control the center:** The pawn structure is important.
3.  **Address White's threats:** White has a strong attack.

Considering all of this, I think the best move is to develop my queen to a more active square and put some pressure on White's position. `Qc6-d7` seems like a good developing move, attacking the pawn on d4 and preparing to control the center.

Alright, I have a lot of options. White's queen on c3 is a major threat. Let's analyze the possibilities:

*   **h8g8, h8f8, h8h7, h8h6, h8h5, h8h4:** Moving the rook doesn't seem to help much immediately.
*   **e8f8, e8f7:** Moving the king is risky, but might be necessary.
*   **a8d8, a8c8, a8b8:** Moving the rook doesn't help.
*   **e7f8, e7d8, e7f6, e7d6, e7g5:** Moving the queen is tempting, but it's also vulnerable.
*   **d7d8, d7c8, d7c7, d7e6, d7d6, d7c6, d7b5, d7a4:** Moving the pawn doesn't seem to help.
*   **f5e6, f5g4, f5h3:** Moving the bishop is interesting, but doesn't address the immediate threat.
*   **e4f6, e4d6, e4g5, e4g3, e4c3, e4f2, e4d2:** Moving the knight doesn't seem to help.
*   **e8g8:** Moving the king is risky, but might be necessary.
*   **e5f4, e5d4:** Moving the pawn doesn't seem to help.
*   **d5c4, c5d4, c5b4:** Moving the pawn doesn't seem to help.
*   **b7b6, a7a6, b7b5, a7a5:** Moving the pawn doesn't seem to help.

The most pressing issue is the queen on c3. I need to find a way to defend against it. Moving the king to f7 seems like the most logical move to protect the king and potentially open a line for the queen.

Okay, that's a lot of moves. Let's analyze them.

*   **Pawn moves:** `h8g8, h8f8, h8e8, h8d8, h8c8, h8b8, h8h7, h8h6, h8h5, h8h4, a8g8, a8f8, a8e8, a8d8, a8c8, a8b8, f7g8, f7f8, f7e8, f7g7, f7e6, e7f8, e7d8, e7f6, e7d6, e7g5, d7e8, d7d8, d7c8, d7c7, d7e6, d7d6, d7c6, d7b5, d7a4, f5e6, f5g4, f5h3, e4f6, e4d6, e4g5, e4g3, e4c3, e4f2, e4d2, e5f4, e5d4, c5d4, c5b4, b7b6, a7a6, c5c4, b7b5, a7a5`

    *   Many of these are pawn moves. Pushing the h-pawn seems pointless. The a-pawn is also not very useful at the moment. The f-pawn can't move forward. The e-pawn is blocked. The d-pawn has some options, but nothing immediately appealing. The c-pawn could challenge the center. The b-pawn and a-pawn are also options.

*   **Knight moves:** `e4f6, e4d6, e4g5, e4g3, e4c3, e4f2, e4d2`

    *   The knight on e4 has several options. Nf6 attacks the white queen and develops the knight. Nd6 also develops the knight and attacks the white queen. Ng5 attacks the bishop on f4. Ng3, Nc3, Nf2, and Nd2 don't seem as good.

*   **Bishop moves:** `f5e6, f5g4, f5h3`

    *   The bishop on f5 has a few options. Be6 attacks the white queen. Bg4 pins the knight on e5. Bh3 doesn't seem as good.

*   **Queen moves:**

    *   The queen on d4 has a lot of options, but I don't see any queen moves in the list.

Considering the position, I think the best move is to develop the knight to f6, attacking the white queen and developing a piece.

Alright, a lot of options. White's queen is a real threat. I need to prioritize defending my king and developing my pieces.

*   **h8h7:** This seems like a reasonable defensive move with the rook.
*   **f7g7:** This move doesn't seem to help much.
*   **d7d6:** This blocks the queen's diagonal and supports the e5 pawn. This seems like a good developing move.
*   **e7d6:** This doesn't seem to help much.
*   **f6h7:** This looks like a good developing move for the knight.
*   **c5c4:** This attacks the pawn on d4.

I think the best move here is to develop the pawn to d6, blocking the queen's diagonal and supporting the e5 pawn.

*   **Develop the rook:** Moving the rook on h8 doesn't seem immediately helpful.
*   **Defend the king:** Moves like f7g7 or f7e6 might help, but they don't address the queen directly.
*   **Attack the queen:** The move f6g4 looks interesting. It attacks the queen and opens up a potential attack on the king.
*   **Pawn moves:** Pawn moves like b7b6 or a7a6 are passive and don't address the immediate threat.

I think the most active move is to challenge the queen. Let's try f6g4.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Okay, that's a lot of moves to consider. Let's break it down and think strategically.

*   **King Safety:** The king on e7 is a bit exposed. Moving the rook on h8 doesn't immediately improve the situation.
*   **Queen Threat:** White's queen on d4 is a direct threat. I need to address this.
*   **Development:** I want to develop my pieces to control the center and create attacking opportunities.
*   **Pawn Structure:** I need to be careful about weakening my pawn structure.

Considering the options, I see a few possibilities:

*   **...Qxd4:** This seems tempting, but it allows White to recapture with a piece, potentially opening lines against my king.
*   **...e5d4:** This is a possibility, but it opens the e-file and gives White's queen more scope.
*   **...f7e6:** This move defends the king and opens the f-file for the rook.

I think the best move is to develop the bishop on f5.

*   **h8g8, h8f8, h8e8, h8d8, h8c8, h8b8, h8h7, h8h6, h8h5, h8h4:** Moving the rook doesn't seem to help much in the immediate situation.

*   **e7f8, e7d8, e7f6, e7g5:** Moving the pawn doesn't seem to help much in the immediate situation.
*   **d6d8, d6b8, d6d7, d6c7, d6f6, d6e6, d6c6, d6b6, d6a6:** Moving the pawn doesn't seem to help much in the immediate situation.
*   **g4h6, g4f6, g4e3, g4h2, g4f2:** The knight moves are interesting, but don't address the immediate threat.
*   **e4f5, e4f3, e4d3, e4g2, e4c2, e4b1:** The bishop moves don't seem to help much in the immediate situation.
*   **e5f4, e5d4:** The bishop moves don't seem to help much in the immediate situation.
*   **c5d4, c5b4:** Capturing the queen with the pawn seems like a good option.
*   **b7b6, a7a6, c5c4, b7b5, a7a5:** These pawn moves don't seem to help much in the immediate situation.

Capturing the queen with c5d4 seems like the best move. It eliminates the immediate threat and opens up the position.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Okay, that's a lot of moves. Let's analyze the most critical ones. White's queen is a major threat. The bishop on f1 is also a problem. My king is vulnerable.

*   **h8h7:** This looks like a reasonable defensive move, getting the rook out of the back rank and potentially defending against a back-rank mate.
*   **f7f6:** This defends the e5 pawn and opens up a diagonal for the bishop.
*   **e7f6:** This also defends the e5 pawn and opens up a diagonal for the bishop.
*   **e7g5:** This could be interesting, attacking the knight and potentially opening lines.
*   **d6d7:** This blocks the queen's attack on the king.
*   **b7b6:** This supports the pawn structure.
*   **a7a6:** This supports the pawn structure.

Considering the threats and the need to develop, I think **f7f6** is a good move. It defends the e5 pawn, opens the diagonal for my bishop, and doesn't weaken my position too much.

*   **King moves:** The King has very limited options, and moving it doesn't seem to improve the situation.
*   **Bishop moves:** The Bishop on f6 has some interesting options. Moving it to e7 seems like a good defensive move, blocking the diagonal of the white Queen.
*   **Knight moves:** The Knight on g4 has a few options, but none seem particularly effective right now.
*   **Pawn moves:** The pawn on d4 has a few options, but none seem particularly effective right now.
*   **Pawn moves:** The pawn on e5 has a few options, but none seem particularly effective right now.

I'll play **f6e7**. This blocks the white Queen's diagonal and develops my Bishop.

You are a professional chess player and you play as black. Now is your turn to make a move. Before making a move you can pick one of the following actions:
- 'get_current_board' to get the schema and current status of the board
- 'get_legal_moves' to get a UCI formatted list of available moves
- 'make_move <UCI formatted move>' when you are ready to complete your turn (e.g., 'make_move e2e4')

Okay, I'm ready to analyze the position and make a move. First, I need to see the current board.

Okay, I see the board. Black's king is somewhat exposed. White has a strong attack developing, especially with the queen and rooks. I need to find a move that addresses the immediate threats and develops my pieces. Let's see what legal moves I have.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Okay, that's a lot of moves. Let's analyze them.

*   **Rook moves (h8... and a8...):** These are mostly defensive, but don't immediately address the threats. Moving the rook on h8 to h7 might be a good defensive move.
*   **Pawn moves (f7..., e7..., d6..., b7..., a7...):** These are mostly developing moves. Pushing the pawn on f7 to f6 would help defend the king.
*   **Bishop moves (e4...):** The bishop on e4 is under attack. Moving it to f3 or d3 seems reasonable.
*   **Bishop moves (g4...):** The bishop on g4 is also under attack. Moving it to f6 or h6 seems reasonable.
*   **Pawn moves (d4...):** This pawn is under attack. Moving it to d3 seems reasonable.
*   **Pawn moves (e5...):** This pawn is under attack. Moving it to f4, f3, d3, g2, c2, b1 seems reasonable.

Considering the immediate threats and the need to develop, I think the best move is to defend the king and develop a piece. Moving the rook on h8 to h7 seems like a good defensive move.

Okay, I see the board. Black is in a slightly difficult position. White has a strong attack developing, especially with the Queen and Rook on the queenside. Black's King is a bit exposed. I need to find a move that addresses the immediate threats and tries to develop my pieces.

Let's get the legal moves.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Okay, that's a lot of moves. Let's analyze the most promising ones:

*   **...a8h8, ...a8g8, ...a8f8, ...a8e8, ...a8d8, ...a8c8, ...a8b8:** Moving the rook doesn't seem to help immediately.
*   **...h7h8, ...h7g7, ...h7h6, ...h7h5, ...h7h4:** Pushing the pawn doesn't seem to accomplish much.
*   **...f7g8, ...f7f8, ...f7e8, ...f7g7, ...f7e6:** The pawn on f7 is pinned by the white bishop, so these moves are not possible.
*   **...e7f8, ...e7d8, ...e7f6, ...e7g5:** Moving the king is probably the most important thing.
*   **...d6d8, ...d6b8, ...d6d7, ...d6c7, ...d6f6, ...d6e6, ...d6c6, ...d6b6, ...d6a6, ...d6c5, ...d6b4:** Moving the pawn on d6 doesn't seem to help.
*   **...g4h6, ...g4f6, ...g4e3, ...g4h2, ...g4f2:** Moving the knight is a possibility.
*   **...e4f5, ...e4f3, ...e4d3, ...e4c2, ...e4b1:** Moving the bishop is a possibility.
*   **...e5f4:** Moving the bishop is a possibility.
*   **...d4e3:** Moving the bishop is a possibility.
*   **...b7b6, ...a7a6, ...d4d3, ...b7b5, ...a7a5:** Pushing pawns doesn't seem to help.

The most critical move is to move the King out of the center.

Therefore, I will move the King to e8.
