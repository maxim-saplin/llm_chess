--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

As Black, I'm facing the opening position after White's 1.h3. This is a rather passive opening move by White that doesn't contest the center. I should aim to take control of the center and develop my pieces.

One of the strongest responses would be 1...e7e5, taking control of the central e5 square and opening lines for both my king's bishop and queen. This is a classical and strong way to start the game.

3. Maintains flexibility for future development
4. Controls important central squares

Therefore, I'll make this move.

Looking at the available moves, I need to make a strategic decision. I notice that my knight on e4 is well-positioned and controls several important squares. However, it could be vulnerable to being attacked. I also see that my king's position could be improved with castling.

Given the position, I think the most important priority is to ensure my king's safety. I see that I can castle kingside by moving my king from g8 to h8.

Looking at the position and available moves, I notice that my king is on h8 and I have the opportunity to castle kingside with my rook on f8. Castling would improve my king's safety and connect my rooks. This is a standard and strong move in such positions.

After analyzing the available moves and the position, I notice that my knight on e4 is well-positioned and putting pressure on several squares. However, it could be vulnerable to being attacked. I also see that I can improve my king's safety by castling.

Given the position, I think the most important priority is to secure my king's safety. Therefore, I will castle kingside.

One of the most pressing needs is to improve my king's safety. Among the available moves, I think moving the king to f8 is a good choice as it:
1. Moves away from the h-file which could become dangerous
2. Maintains protection of the important e7 square
3. Creates connection between my rooks

Therefore, I will make this move:

Looking at the position and the available moves, I notice several important factors:
1. My king is exposed on h8
2. White's queen is aggressively placed on d4
3. I have multiple knights that could develop to better squares

One of the most pressing needs is to improve my king's safety. The most natural move would be to castle-like move my king to g8, which would also connect my rooks.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Let me analyze the available moves:

1. My king is in check from White's queen on d4
2. I need to either block the check, capture the queen, or move my king
3. Looking at the legal moves, I have several options to deal with the check:
   - Move king: g8h8
   - Block with knight: c6d4 (capturing the queen)
   - Block with pawn: d8e7

The best move here appears to be capturing the queen with my knight (c6d4). This not only removes the check but also eliminates White's strongest piece.

1. I notice my king is in the corner (g8), and I have an opportunity to castle kingside with 'g8h8'

3. I have several pawn moves available

Given that my king's safety is a priority and I see no immediate threats, I think completing my kingside castle would be a good move. This will help protect my king and connect my rooks.

3. There appears to be some tension in the center

Looking at the available moves, I need to consider my priorities:
1. Safety of my king
2. Development of pieces
3. Control of key squares

I notice that my knight on d4 has several strong options, and given White's advanced queen on e5, I can potentially gain tempo by attacking it. The move Nd4-f5 looks particularly strong as it:
1. Attacks the queen
2. Controls important central squares
3. Cannot be immediately captured due to the pawn on e5

Therefore, I'll make this move.

Looking at the position and the available moves, I need to be careful about White's queen on e5 which is quite threatening. I notice I have several key defensive moves available.

The most pressing concern is protecting against any immediate threats and maintaining control of key squares. One strong move would be to protect the e7 square and create a more solid pawn structure by playing 'f7e6'. This move:
1. Controls important central squares
2. Protects against potential queen threats
3. Opens up lines for my pieces
4. Creates a more solid pawn structure

I'll make this move.

After analyzing the legal moves and the position, I notice several important factors:
1. White's knight on c7 is threatening multiple pieces
2. My king is relatively safe but could use more protection
3. I have two bishops that could be developed better
4. The f6 knight and f5 bishop have multiple options

Given that White's knight on c7 is a immediate threat and is attacking both my queen and rook, I should address this situation. The best move appears to be capturing the knight with my queen:

make_move d8c7

This move:
1. Eliminates the threatening knight
2. Maintains control of the center
3. Keeps my queen active
4. Captures a piece, gaining material advantage

Looking at the position and available moves, I notice I'm playing as Black and need to ensure my king's safety while maintaining a good position. 

I see that my king on g8 is somewhat exposed, and it might be good to improve its position. Among the legal moves, moving the king to h8 (g8h8) looks like a solid defensive move that puts the king in a safer corner position.

Looking at the position and available moves, I notice I have several interesting options. I see that my queen on c7 has many possibilities, and I have some bishop moves that could be tactical. Let me analyze the key moves:

1. The queen on c7 has multiple aggressive options
2. My bishop on f5 could create some threats
3. I have control of the f-file with my rook

After evaluating the position, I think I should maintain control of the center and increase pressure with my queen. The move c7c4 looks particularly strong as it:
- Attacks the pawn on b4
- Maintains control of the c-file
- Creates pressure towards the white king's position
- Maintains flexibility for future moves

I'll make this move:

2. I can improve my rook's position with moves like Rf8-e8 or Rf8-d8
3. I can strengthen my pawn structure with various pawn moves

Given White's exposed king position, I think the most forcing and advantageous move would be to check the king with my bishop.

One particularly strong move I see is moving my knight to f3, which attacks White's rook on h2 while also maintaining pressure in the center. This forces White to respond to the threat and maintains my initiative.

Given the position, I notice that my knight on f3 is quite active and is putting pressure on White's position. However, I also need to consider my king's safety.

After analyzing the position, I think it would be good to improve my king's position by moving it away from the h-file, which could become dangerous if White opens it up.

Looking at the position and available moves, I notice that my king is on g8 and I should prioritize its safety. I also have two bishops that could be developed better. Among the legal moves, I see that I can improve my position by moving my bishop from g5.

The bishop on g5 has several good options, and moving it to e3 looks particularly strong as it attacks White's position and controls important central squares. This move also maintains pressure on White's position while staying flexible.

Looking at the position and available moves, I notice I have my bishop on e3 with several good options, and my king position needs attention. 

The bishop on e3 is well-placed and attacking several squares. However, I also need to ensure my king's safety. Looking at the position, I think it would be wise to improve my king's position by moving it to a safer square.

I'll move my king from g8 to f8, which maintains control of important central squares while improving my king's safety.

Given that my king's safety is a priority and White's king is already out in the open (on b2), I think castling kingside would be a good strategic choice. This will help protect my king and connect my rooks.

3. I have various pawn moves available.

Given that:
- My king is currently exposed in the center
- The kingside appears relatively safe for castling
- It's generally good practice to get the king to safety when possible
- The kingside castle will also connect my rooks

I will castle kingside.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Looking at the position and available moves, I notice several important factors:
1. I'm playing as Black and my king is on g8
2. White has a rook on a4 and a knight on g4 creating some pressure
3. I have a bishop on f2 that's quite active and could be used effectively

Among my options, I think the most strategic move would be to protect my king's position while maintaining control of important squares. Moving my rook to f8 would create a solid defensive setup.

You are a professional chess player and you play as black. Now is your turn to make a move. Before making a move you can pick one of the following actions:
- 'get_current_board' to get the schema and current status of the board
- 'get_legal_moves' to get a UCI formatted list of available moves
- 'make_move <UCI formatted move>' when you are ready to complete your turn (e.g., 'make_move e2e4')

Let me first check the current state of the board.

Let me analyze the position. I see I'm playing as Black and there seems to be quite a complex position with several pieces in play. Before making my decision, I should check what legal moves are available to me.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Looking at the available moves and the position, I notice several key points:
1. I have a rook on f8 with multiple possible moves
2. I have a bishop on f2 that's quite active and threatening
3. My king is on h8 and can move to g8

Given that my king is somewhat exposed and White has a rook on c3 that could be threatening, I think it's prudent to improve my king's position by moving it away from the h-file. This is a prophylactic move that will make my king safer.

1. White has a strong rook on c3
2. I have two bishops, one on f2 which looks quite active
3. My king is on g8 and seems relatively safe

Let me check what legal moves I have available.

After analyzing the legal moves, I notice several interesting options:

1. The bishop on f2 has multiple strong diagonal moves available
2. I can move my rook on f8 in several directions
3. I have some pawn moves available

One particularly strong move I see is moving my bishop from f2 to c5, which would:
1. Attack White's pawn on b4
2. Control important central squares
3. Create pressure along the c5-f2 diagonal

This looks like the most active and threatening move available.

One strong move would be to use my bishop to attack White's position. The bishop on c5 can move to e3, which would create a strong threat and control important squares.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Looking at the position and available moves, I notice I have a bishop on e3 with several good options, and control of some key files with my rooks. Let me analyze the best move:

1. The bishop on e3 has several attractive moves, particularly the diagonal moves that could increase pressure.
2. I have rook control on the f-file with potential attacking chances.
3. My king is relatively safe.

After analyzing the position, I think moving my bishop to g5 would be a strong move, as it:
- Maintains control of important diagonals
- Creates threats against white's position
- Maintains flexibility for future plans

I'll make this move:

I notice that my rook on f8 has several potential moves, and given the position, I should try to maintain control of the f-file while also ensuring my king's safety. 

The move f8f7 looks particularly strong as it:
1. Maintains control of the f-file
2. Protects the g7 pawn
3. Adds protection to my king
4. Maintains flexibility for future moves

I'll make this move.

Looking at the position and available moves, I notice several key points:
1. My king is on g8 and relatively safe
2. I have a rook on f7 that's very active
3. I have a bishop on d8 that could be developed

One strong move would be to develop my bishop to f6, which would control important central squares and put pressure on white's position.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Let me analyze the position and the available moves:

1. I notice my king is on g8 and can move to h8 or f8
2. I have a rook on a8 that has multiple moves along the back rank
3. I have another rook on f7
4. I have a bishop on f6 with several diagonal moves
5. I have several pawn moves available

Given that:
- My king's position seems relatively safe at the moment
- The white rook on c3 is threatening down the c-file
- I can improve my rook's position on f7

I think one of the strongest moves would be to centralize my rook with:

make_move f7e7

This move:
- Maintains control of the e-file
- Protects the e5 pawn
- Maintains flexibility for future operations
- Keeps my rook active in the center

Let me analyze the position and the available moves:

1. I notice my king is on h8 and I have a rook on f8 protecting it
2. White's king is on b2, quite far from my king
3. I have several pawn moves available
4. My bishop on f6 can move to g5

Looking at the position, I want to maintain control of the f-file with my rook while also keeping my king safe. Moving the rook away from f8 would weaken my king's protection. Among the available moves, I think advancing my d-pawn to d5 would be a good strategic choice as it:
- Controls more central squares
- Creates more space for my pieces
- Could potentially become a passed pawn later

Therefore, I'll make this move:

Looking at the position, I notice that my king's safety is important, and I should be careful about white's rook on c3. The pawn on d5 is also important to consider.

After analyzing the position, I think strengthening my king's position while maintaining control of the e-file would be prudent. I'll move my king to g8, which maintains protection and gives more flexibility for my rooks.

Looking at the position and available moves, I notice I have several options with my rooks and other pieces. The most critical piece seems to be my rook on e7, which is well-positioned and controlling important squares.

After analyzing the position, I think it's best to increase the activity of my rook on f8 by moving it to the more central d8 square, which will help control the d-file and put more pressure on White's position.

Let me analyze the available moves:

1. I'm playing as Black and my king is on h8
2. I have a rook on d8 and e7
3. I have a bishop on f6
4. Several pawn moves are available

Looking at the position, I notice that my king is somewhat exposed and White has a rook on a7 that could be threatening. One strong move would be to centralize my rook on d8 to control the d-file and potentially create threats.

I'll play:

make_move d8d7

This move:
1. Controls the d-file
2. Protects the d5 pawn
3. Maintains flexibility for future moves
4. Keeps my rooks connected

Looking at the legal moves, I need to be careful about my king's safety while maintaining control of key squares. The move h7h6 looks solid as it:
1. Creates a luft (escape square) for my king
2. Maintains control of the g7 square
3. Doesn't weaken my position

I'll make this move:

Looking at the position and the available moves, I notice several key points:
1. I have control of the 7th rank with my rooks
2. My king is relatively exposed on h8
3. White has some activity with their bishops

One of the most important moves I can make is to improve my king's safety. Moving from h8 to g8 would be a good prophylactic move that protects against potential back rank issues and slightly improves my king's position.

4. Several pawns in good positions

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Let me analyze the available moves. I need to consider:
1. Safety of my king
2. Control of key squares
3. Piece coordination

Looking at the position and legal moves:
- Moving the king to h8 or f8 doesn't improve my position
- The rook moves don't create immediate threats
- The bishop has some active options
- I have some pawn advances available

One strong move appears to be moving my bishop to e7 (f6e7). This:
1. Maintains control of important central squares
2. Protects my rook on d7
3. Creates a more solid pawn structure
4. Keeps my pieces well coordinated

I'll make this move.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

I see my position as Black. I have a king on g8 with a few possible moves, and a rook on d7 that can move to f7. Looking at the position:

1. My king is currently on g8 and can move to h8, f8, h7, or f7
2. My rook on d7 can move to f7
3. I notice White has a dangerous passed pawn on f6
4. I have some pawns providing protection for my king

Given that White's pawn on f6 is threatening to advance, I should keep my rook controlling the f-file if possible. Moving the rook to f7 would both protect against the pawn advance and maintain control of the f-file.

I'll make this move:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Let me analyze these legal moves and the position:

1. I'm playing as Black and my king is on g8
2. White has a strong rook on c3 and two bishops on b2 and b1
3. I have a rook on f7 which is currently protecting my king
4. I have a bishop on c5 that could be developed

Looking at the position, I need to be careful about potential threats and maintain king safety. The bishop on c5 has several good diagonal moves available, and moving it to f2 could create some pressure.

However, I think the most pressing concern is improving my king's position. Moving to h8 would be safer as it gets out of potential checks from the white pieces.

I'll make the move:

Looking at the position and legal moves, I notice several key points:
1. My king has limited mobility
2. I have a rook on f7 that's quite active
3. My bishop on c5 has good diagonals
4. White's rook on c3 is threatening my position

One strong move would be to use my bishop to attack White's king while maintaining control of important squares. The move Bc5-f2 looks particularly strong as it:
1. Attacks White's king directly
2. Controls important diagonal squares
3. Maintains a strong defensive position

1. My king is on h8
2. I have a rook on f7
3. There's a complex pawn structure
4. Both sides have bishops

Let me check what legal moves I have available.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Let me evaluate the key moves:

1. Moving my king from h8 doesn't seem urgent as it's relatively safe.
2. The rook on f7 has many options but needs to maintain protection of the 7th rank.
3. My bishop on f2 has several diagonal moves available.
4. I have some pawn moves available.

Looking at the position, I notice that my bishop on f2 is quite active and could create threats. One particularly strong move would be to attack White's king on c3 while maintaining control of important diagonals.

I'll play:

make_move f2e3

This move:
1. Maintains pressure on White's king
2. Controls important central squares
3. Keeps my bishop active and flexible
4. Doesn't weaken my king's position

4. White has a dangerous rook on c3

Among my legal moves, I need to choose one that maintains control and possibly improves my position. The bishop on e3 is particularly well placed, attacking White's king position. I think I can strengthen my position by moving my rook to create more threats.

I'll play:

make_move f7f3

This move puts pressure on White's position and maintains control of the third rank, while keeping my rook protected by the bishop. It also creates threats against White's king side.

One of the strongest moves available is to use my rook on f3 to attack up the f-file, particularly targeting f8 which could lead to checkmate threats. This also maintains control of the important f-file.

2. I have a rook on f8 that has multiple possible moves
3. I have pawns on g7, h6, d5, and e5

The position seems quite critical. I need to be careful about my king's safety and maintain control of key squares. One strong move would be to protect my king while maintaining control of the f-file with my rook.

I'll move my rook to f7, which protects my king, maintains control of the f-file, and defends the g7 pawn.

Looking at the position and the available moves, I notice that:
1. I'm playing as Black and my king is on g8
2. I have a rook on f7 that has many potential moves
3. I have some pawns that can advance

Given that my king is somewhat exposed and White has some attacking pieces (rook on b6 and bishops), I should prioritize king safety and try to maintain control of key squares.

The move f7f8 looks strong as it:
1. Protects the king
2. Controls the f-file
3. Maintains flexibility for future moves

3. I have pawns on g7, h6, d5, and e5

Given that White has a strong presence in the center with bishops and pawns, I should prioritize my king's safety and maintain control of key squares. The rook on f8 is currently protecting the king and controlling the f-file.

I'll play:

make_move g7g6

This move:
1. Creates a safe square on g7 for my king if needed
2. Maintains pawn protection
3. Prevents White from using the g6 square for any pieces
4. Keeps my pawn structure relatively solid

Among my legal moves, I should prioritize:
1. Keeping my king safe

The move f8f2 looks particularly strong as it:
1. Attacks white's position from behind

3. Could potentially target white's pawns
4. Keeps my rook active and flexible

I'll make this move.

2. White has a dangerous rook on b6 and two bishops on c3 and d3
3. I have a rook on f4 that's quite active
4. There are several pawn structures to consider

One of my main concerns is protecting my king while maintaining control of the position. The rook on f4 is well-placed, controlling the f-file and putting pressure on White's position.

After evaluating the available moves, I think the best move is to improve my king's safety by moving it to h8, getting it away from the potential threats along the g-file.

1. The rook on f4 has many options, including going up the f-file or horizontally.
2. I have some pawn moves available (h6h5, g6g5).
3. I can move my king, but I need to be careful to stay safe.

The most active and threatening move appears to be moving my rook up the f-file to f7, which puts pressure on White's position and maintains control of the important f-file.

I'll move my rook to e7, which helps control the e-file and maintains flexibility:

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Looking at the position, I'm playing as Black and I notice several key aspects:
1. My king is on h8 with the rook on h7
2. White has a dangerous rook on c3 and two bishops on c3 and d3
3. I have some pawn structure with pawns on e5, g6, and h6

Among my legal moves, I should prioritize safety and control. The most pressing concern is protecting my king and maintaining control of key squares.

I'll play:

make_move h8g8

This move keeps my king safe while maintaining connection with my rook. It's a solid defensive move that helps protect against potential threats while maintaining flexibility for future moves.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

I have only two legal moves available for my king: g8g7 or g8f7. Looking at the position:

1. Moving to g7 (g8g7) would keep my king protected by my rook on h8 and maintain control of the g-file
2. Moving to f7 (g8f7) would expose my king more and disconnect it from the rook's protection

The safer and better choice is to keep my king connected with my rook, so I'll move to g7.

h7h8,g7f8,d5e4,h6h5,g6g5,d5d4

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Looking at the legal moves available, I need to make a strategic decision. The position seems to be in an endgame phase with both kings exposed. Let me analyze the options:

1. h7h8: Moving my rook to the back rank
2. g7f8: Moving my king to f8
3. d5e4: Advancing my pawn
4. h6h5: Advancing my h-pawn
5. g6g5: Advancing my g-pawn
6. d5d4: Advancing my d-pawn

Given that White has a rook on f6 and two bishops, I need to be careful about my king's safety. Moving my king to f8 (g7f8) seems like a good defensive move as it gets away from potential checks from White's rook while maintaining control of important squares.

Let me analyze the position:
1. I'm playing as Black and my king is on f8
2. I have a rook on h7 and pawns on g6, h6, d5, and e5
3. White has two bishops on c3 and d3, and their king is on d3

Looking at the available moves, I need to be careful about my king's safety and maintain control of key squares. The rook on h7 is currently well-positioned, protecting the h6 pawn and controlling the 7th rank.

One strong move would be to improve my king's position by moving it to g8, which would protect it better and maintain control of the important f7 square. This also keeps my king connected to my rook.

I'll make this move:

The most active move appears to be pushing the d-pawn to d4, which would challenge White's control of the center and potentially create threats. This seems like the strongest move in the position.

Let me analyze the position:
1. I'm playing as Black and my king is on g8
2. I have a rook on h7 that seems to be well positioned
3. I have pawns on e5, h6, and d4
4. White has some pawns and two bishops

Looking at the legal moves, I want to keep my king safe while maintaining control of the position. Moving the rook away from the 7th rank would weaken my position, and moving pawns forward needs to be done carefully.

The safest and most solid move appears to be moving my king to f8, which maintains king safety while keeping control of important squares.

Looking at the position and available moves, I notice I'm playing as Black and have my king on f8 with a rook on h7. The position seems to be in an endgame phase with several pawns for both sides.

After analyzing the available moves, I think moving my rook to control the 7th rank would be a strong choice, as it can protect my pawns and potentially threaten White's position.

I'll make the move:

Let me analyze the position and the available moves:

1. I'm playing as Black and my king is on f8
2. I have a rook on d7 which seems to be quite active
3. I have several pawns, including one on d4 that's quite advanced
4. White has two bishops and some pawns

Looking at the legal moves, I notice I can:
- Move my king to safer squares
- Use my rook along the 7th rank or move it vertically
- Push my pawns

Given that my rook on d7 is quite active and can potentially create threats along the 7th rank, I think it's best to maintain its strong position while also targeting White's pawns.

I'll make a move with the rook to target White's b-pawn:

Given that my rook on b7 has a lot of mobility and could potentially create threats, I'll check the horizontal moves, particularly towards the white king on e5. Moving the rook to e7 could create pressure on the e-file and restrict the white king's movement.

1. Maintains control of the 7th rank
2. Protects my h6 pawn
3. Could potentially support future advances of my h-pawn

Therefore, I will move my rook from e7 to h7.

Looking at the position, I'm playing as Black and I notice:
1. My king is on g8
2. I have a rook on e7
3. There's a pawn on h6 that can advance

Given that White has two bishops and several pawns, I should be careful about my king's safety. The rook on e7 seems to be my strongest piece, and I should try to use it effectively.

Looking at the legal moves, I can either:
1. Move my king
2. Move my rook along the 7th rank
3. Advance my h6 pawn

I think the best move here would be to use my rook to control more of the 7th rank and potentially threaten White's position. Moving it to h7 would protect my h6 pawn and create more pressure.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Looking at the position, I have several options. I'm playing as Black and I notice my king is on g8 and my rook is on h7. The position seems to be in an endgame phase with several pawns and two white bishops.

Among my legal moves, I can:
1. Move my king (g8h8 or g8g7)
2. Move my rook horizontally (h7f7, h7e7, etc.)
3. Move my rook vertically (h7h8 or h6h5)

Given that my rook is currently protecting my king from the back rank and controlling the 7th rank, I should be careful not to weaken my king's position. Moving the rook away horizontally could be dangerous as it would leave my king more exposed.

I think the safest and most flexible move is to improve my king's position by moving it to h8, which maintains control of the important squares while staying protected.

Among my options, moving the rook to control more squares while maintaining protection of my king seems wise. The move h7e7 looks particularly strong as it:
1. Controls more of the 7th rank
2. Maintains connection with my king
3. Can potentially threaten White's pawns

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Looking at the position, I have a rook on e7 and my king on h8. The position seems to be in a critical stage. Let me analyze the best move:

1. My rook on e7 has multiple options along the 7th rank
2. My king can move to g7 or g8
3. I can push my h-pawn from h6 to h5

Given that my king is somewhat exposed and there are two white bishops controlling important squares, I should prioritize king safety while maintaining control with my rook.

The move h8g8 seems safest, keeping my king protected while maintaining flexibility with my rook. This keeps my king away from potential checks from the white bishops.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Looking at the available moves, I need to make a strategic decision. Here's my analysis:

1. My king on g7 can move to g6, which might be safer as it gets away from the back rank.
2. My rook on e7 has multiple options along the 7th rank, and can also move to e8.
3. I have a pawn move available with h6-h5.

Given that:
- White's rook on b8 is threatening my back rank
- Moving my king to g6 would be safer and prevent any potential back-rank mates
- The move g7-g6 also maintains control of the g-file and protects against any threats involving White's g7 pawn

I decide to make the king move:

1. My rook on e7 is active and controls the 7th rank
2. White's bishops are controlling important diagonals
3. My king on g6 is relatively safe but needs to maintain protection of the h6 pawn

Among the available moves, I think the best option is to keep control of the 7th rank while putting pressure on White's position. Moving the rook to h7 would protect the h6 pawn while maintaining control of the 7th rank and creating potential threats.

You are a professional chess player and you play as black. Now is your turn to make a move. Before making a move you can pick one of the following actions:
- 'get_current_board' to get the schema and current status of the board
- 'get_legal_moves' to get a UCI formatted list of available moves
- 'make_move <UCI formatted move>' when you are ready to complete your turn (e.g., 'make_move e2e4')

Let me analyze the position. I'm playing as Black, and I can see that:
1. White has two bishops, a rook, and three pawns
2. Black has a rook, two pawns, and the king
3. My king is on g7, somewhat exposed

Let me check what legal moves I have available.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Looking at the legal moves and the position, I need to make a careful decision. The key observations are:

1. My rook on h7 has multiple options along the 7th rank
2. My king on g6 can move in several directions
3. White's bishops on c3 and c4 are controlling important diagonals

Given that my king is somewhat exposed and White has two bishops targeting my kingside, I should prioritize king safety. Moving the king to f7 looks like a good defensive move as it:
1. Gets the king away from the edge of the board
2. Maintains control of important central squares
3. Protects against potential checks from White's pieces

Therefore, I'll make the move:

Looking at the position and the available legal moves, I notice that:
1. I'm playing as Black and have my king on f7
2. White has two bishops and a rook as attacking pieces
3. I have a few pawn moves and king moves available

Among the available moves:
- Moving the h7 pawn to h8 would create a new queen, but might not be the best move right now
- Moving the king to g7 (either from f7 or h7) could be risky due to the white bishops
- The pawn move h6h5 seems relatively safe and maintains control of important squares

I'll choose to make the pawn move h6h5, as it's the safest option and helps maintain control of the kingside.

Let me analyze the position. I'm playing as Black, and I see my king on f6 and rook on h6, with pawns on e5 and h4. White has two bishops on b4 and b5, a rook on b7, king on d1, and pawns on e4 and e5.

Let me check what legal moves I have available.

h7h8,h7g7,h7h6,f7g7,f7g6,h5h4

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Looking at my legal moves, I have several options:
1. Moving my king (f7-g7, f7-g6)
2. Moving my rook (h7-h8, h7-g7, h7-h6)
3. Moving my pawn (h5-h4)

Given the position:
- Moving my king to g7 or g6 would be risky as it could expose me to checks from White's bishops
- Moving my rook to h8 doesn't improve my position
- Moving my rook to g7 blocks my king's movement
- Moving my rook to h6 loses control of the 7th rank
- Moving my pawn to h4 doesn't seem to provide any immediate advantage

The safest and most strategic move appears to be keeping my rook on the 7th rank where it has the most activity and can potentially create threats. I'll move it to g7, which helps protect my king while maintaining pressure.

Given that White's knight move to h3 is somewhat passive, I'll go with the classical response of controlling the center with:

Looking at the position and available moves, I notice that my king's position is somewhat exposed with the missing knight on f6. I should focus on developing my pieces and improving my position.

One good developing move would be to bring my dark-squared bishop into play with 'f8e7', which would:
1. Develop a piece
2. Protect the king
3. Maintain flexibility for future castling
4. Control important central squares

One strong move would be to play Nf6-e4, attacking White's bishop on e5 while maintaining control of central squares. This move would force White to either retreat the bishop or defend it, giving me the initiative.

After analyzing the position and the available moves, I notice that my bishop on e7 is under attack by White's bishop on e5. I should consider either defending it or moving it to a safe square while maintaining good control of the center.

Looking at the available moves, moving the bishop to f6 seems strong because:
1. It moves to a safe square
2. It maintains control of important central squares
3. It puts pressure on White's kingside
4. It works well with my knights' positioning

I'll make this move:

1. White has a strong center presence with their bishop on e5
2. My knights are well-positioned on d4 and e4
3. I need to ensure my king's safety

Let me check what legal moves I have available.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

After analyzing the available moves and the position, I notice that my knights are putting good pressure on White's position. However, I need to be careful about White's bishop on e5 which controls important squares.

One strong move would be to play ...Ne4f2+, attacking White's queen and king simultaneously with a discovered attack from my other knight on d4. This fork would win material.

I'll make this move:

Let me evaluate the available moves. I notice several key aspects:
1. I have control of the d4 square with my knight, which is in a strong central position
2. My king's position is relatively safe
3. I have several potential tactical opportunities

Among the available moves, I'm particularly interested in the knight moves from d4, as it's my most actively placed piece. The move d4f3 looks especially strong as it:
1. Attacks White's queen
2. Maintains control of central squares
3. Cannot be easily driven away

Therefore, I will make this move.

Looking at the available moves and the position, I notice several important factors:
1. My king is on g8 with a somewhat exposed position
2. I have a knight on f2 that's deep in White's territory and could be active
3. The e5 pawn is controlling central squares

Among the available moves, I think the knight on f2 deserves attention as it's in a strong outpost and could create threats. The move f2e4 looks particularly strong as it:
1. Attacks White's queen on d4
2. Controls important central squares
3. Maintains an active piece position

I'll make this move:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Looking at the position and available moves, I notice I'm in a relatively equal middle game position. I should focus on improving my piece activity and maintaining control of key squares.

The knight on e4 is well-placed and putting pressure on White's position. However, it could be vulnerable to attack. One strong move would be to protect it while also increasing control of the center with 'c7c5'. This move:
1. Supports the knight on e4
2. Controls important central squares
3. Creates counterplay on the queenside
4. Follows good chess principles by fighting for the center

I'll make this move:

2. Connects my rooks
3. Activates my rook on the g-file

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

As Black, I have several good options to respond to e4. The most common and strong responses are:
1. e7e5 (King's Pawn Game) - directly contesting the center
2. c7c5 (Sicilian Defense) - asymmetrically fighting for the center
3. e7e6 (French Defense) - solid but slightly passive
4. c7c6 (Caro-Kann Defense) - solid and reliable

As a professional player, I'll choose the Sicilian Defense with c7c5, which is known for creating sharp, dynamic positions with good counterplay for Black.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Looking at the available moves, I need to respond to White's aggressive play. The most principled response would be to develop a piece and contest the center. Among the legal moves, Nf6 (g8f6) is one of the best moves as it:
1. Develops a piece
2. Controls important central squares (e4 and d5)
3. Prepares for kingside castling

Therefore, I will play Nf6.

3. I can push e7-e5 to contest the center

The most solid and positionally sound move here appears to be developing my knight to c6. This helps control the center squares, particularly d4, and follows good opening principles of development.

You are a professional chess player and you play as black. Now is your turn to make a move. Before making a move you can pick one of the following actions:
- 'get_current_board' to get the schema and current status of the board
- 'get_legal_moves' to get a UCI formatted list of available moves
- 'make_move <UCI formatted move>' when you are ready to complete your turn (e.g., 'make_move e2e4')

Let me analyze the position. I can see that:
1. White has developed their knights to a3 and h3
2. White's bishop is on a6, attacking my position
3. I have my knights developed to c6 and e4
4. There's some tension in the center

Let me check what legal moves I have available.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Looking at the available moves and the position, I notice that my knight on e4 is quite active and has several good options. One particularly strong move would be to play Ne4-f6, which:
1. Maintains control of central squares
2. Protects the kingside
3. Creates a strong defensive position
4. Can't be easily dislodged by White's pieces

I'll make this move.

After analyzing the position and the available moves, I notice that my king's safety could be improved by castling kingside. The move h8g8 would achieve this, connecting my rooks and bringing my king to a safer position. This is a standard development move that will help protect my king and potentially activate my rook on the g-file later.

Looking at the available moves and the position, I notice several important factors:
1. White's king is exposed on e2
2. I have two knights that could potentially be used in an attack
3. I have control of some central squares

One of the strongest moves appears to be moving my knight from e5 to f3+, which would give check to White's exposed king and potentially lead to a strong attack.

1. Controls important central squares
2. Creates a threat against White's position
3. Maintains flexibility for future maneuvers

I see that I have two legal moves available:
1. g7f6 - Moving my g7 pawn to f6
2. e7f6 - Moving my e7 pawn to f6

Given that my knight on f6 has been captured by White's piece, I need to recapture. Between the two pawns that can capture on f6, the better choice is to recapture with the e-pawn (e7f6). This is because:
1. It maintains better pawn structure by not creating doubled pawns
2. It keeps the g-file closed, protecting my kingside
3. It maintains control of the central e5 square

Therefore, I will make my move:

Looking at the position and available moves, I notice I'm playing as Black and White has already developed some pieces. I should focus on development and control of the center.

The knight on f3 is in a good attacking position, and I have several reasonable developing moves available. One of the strongest developing moves would be to castle kingside with 'g8h8', which would bring my rook to an active position and secure my king's safety.

2. I have a knight on g5 that has some active squares

Among the available moves, I think moving my knight from g5 to e4 would be a strong choice because:
1. It attacks the center
2. It creates pressure on White's position
3. It's a safe square for the knight
4. It could potentially threaten White's king position

The knight on f2 has several good squares available, and moving it to e4 looks particularly strong as it would control important central squares and put pressure on White's position.

Let me analyze the position and the available moves:

1. I notice my king is on f8 and White's pieces are quite active in the center
2. White has a strong bishop on e5 controlling important squares
3. My knight on e4 is well-positioned and could be used tactically

Among the legal moves, I see a few strategic options:
- I could protect my king by moving it to e8 with f8e8
- I could develop my rook with g8h8
- I could try to challenge White's center control with moves like c5c4

After consideration, I think the most urgent priority is to improve my king's safety by moving it away from the f-file where it could be vulnerable to attacks.

Looking at the available moves, I need to be careful as White has an active position. My knight on e4 is well-placed and is putting pressure on White's position. However, it could be vulnerable, and I should consider if I need to move it to a safer square.

One strong move would be to play 'e4c3', moving the knight to c3. This:
1. Attacks White's queen on d4
2. Maintains control of central squares
3. Forces White to respond, giving me initiative

Looking at the available moves, I need to consider my position carefully. I notice that my king's position could use some attention, and I have some tactical opportunities with my knight on c3.

After analyzing the position:
1. My king could benefit from having the rook on h8 for better protection
2. The knight on c3 is well-placed and has several interesting options
3. My bishop on e7 is somewhat restricted

I think the most solid move here would be to connect my rooks and strengthen my king's position by moving the rook from g8 to h8.

The move e5f4 looks strong as it:
1. Moves the queen to safety
2. Maintains pressure on White's position
3. Controls important central squares
4. Keeps attacking possibilities

Looking at the available moves, I notice several important factors:
1. My king's position is relatively exposed
2. I have a knight on e4 that's well positioned and attacking some key squares
3. My dark-squared bishop on e7 has some active possibilities

Given the position, I think it's important to improve my piece activity while maintaining king safety. The knight on e4 is well-placed and should probably stay there for now.

I think developing my rook to f8 would be a good move, as it protects the king and prepares for potential action on the f-file.

Looking at the available moves, I need to address the threat to my knight on e4. I have several options:

1. I could move the knight to safety, with moves like Ne4-f6, Ne4-g5, or Ne4-c3
2. I could defend the knight with moves like f7-f6
3. I could make a counter-threat

Among these options, moving the knight to c3 looks particularly attractive because:
1. It gets out of danger
2. It attacks White's rook on b1
3. It maintains an active position for the knight

Therefore, I'll make this move:

One strong move would be to play the knight to e4, which:
1. Attacks White's queen
2. Controls important central squares
3. Creates a more active position for my pieces

I'll make this move.

One solid move would be to improve my king's safety by castling kingside, which would also connect my rooks. This is particularly important given the white queen's active position.

I'll make the castling move:

I need to get out of check and protect my pieces. Looking at the legal moves, I have several options to block or escape the check from the bishop on e5.

The most critical threat is the check from White's bishop. I notice that my bishop on e7 can block the check by moving to f6, which would also protect against the queen's attack on my knight.

This seems like the most logical move as it:
1. Gets me out of check
2. Protects my knight on e5
3. Maintains control of important central squares

Let me analyze the position and the available moves:

1. I notice my king is in the center (e8) and White's queen is on f4, which could be dangerous.
2. I have a knight on e4 that's well-positioned and could make some tactical moves.
3. My kingside castling is still available (g8h8 move is legal).

Given the position, I think the most urgent priority is to improve my king's safety. Kingside castling looks like the best option as it will both protect my king and connect my rooks.

1. My king is on e8 and appears to be somewhat exposed
2. White has a strong attack with the queen on f6 and bishop on e5
3. I notice I have a knight on e4 that's well positioned and could make some tactical moves

Among the legal moves, I see some interesting options:
1. e4f2 - Knight fork attacking White's king and rook
2. e4d6 - Knight move to a safer square that maintains control of central squares
3. e8f8 - King move to safety

The knight fork on f2 looks particularly strong as it attacks both the king and rook, forcing White to respond. This could help relieve some of the pressure on my position.

1. My king is on e8 and appears to be relatively safe
2. I have a knight on f6 that has multiple attacking options
3. White has a strong presence in the center with pawns and a bishop on e5
4. White's queen on f6 could be threatening

Looking at the legal moves, I notice that my knight on f6 has several good options. One particularly strong move would be to attack White's queen with Nf6-e4, which would force the queen to move and gain control of a central square.

I apologize for my error. I misread the position. Looking at the board again:

1. I actually have a knight on f2 (not f6)
2. I have a bishop on f6
3. White's queen is on f3 (not f6 as I incorrectly stated)

Let me look at my options again. One strong move would be to use my knight on f2 to attack White's queen on f3 by moving it to e4.

Looking at the position and available moves, I notice I'm in a somewhat cramped position. My king's safety is a concern, and I should try to improve my piece coordination. The knight on e4 is well-placed and could be used tactically.

After analyzing the available moves, I think I should improve my king's safety by castling kingside, which will also connect my rooks.

Looking at the position and available moves, I notice my knight on e4 is quite active and could potentially create some threats. Let me analyze some key moves:

1. The knight on e4 has several strong squares, particularly f2 which attacks the white king and rook.
2. My king's position seems relatively safe, though I should be mindful of potential attacks.
3. The bishop on f6 controls some important diagonals.

After consideration, I think the most forcing and advantageous move is to move the knight to f2, creating a direct threat to both the white king and rook.

Looking at the position and available moves, I notice that my king is in the center and I should prioritize its safety. I also see that my knight on f6 has several options. Let me analyze the key aspects:

1. King safety is a priority
2. My pieces are relatively well developed
3. I have control of some key central squares

After evaluating the position, I think it's best to improve my king's safety by castling kingside. This will protect my king and connect my rooks.

Looking at the available moves and the position, I need to consider a few key factors:
1. My king's safety
2. Development of pieces
3. Control of key squares

I notice that my knight on f6 has several options, and it's currently helping to protect against threats in the center. However, I also see that White's queen is on d4 and bishop on e5, creating some pressure.

One solid move would be to improve my king's safety by castling kingside, which would connect my rooks and get my king to a safer square.

- Protect my king
- Connect my rooks
- Develop my rook to a more active position

Looking at the position and my available legal moves, I notice that:

1. My king is in the center (e8)
2. I have a knight on f6 that can move to either e7 or e5
3. I have a bishop on f2 that can move to e4

The most critical aspect of this position is my king's safety. Moving the knight to e7 would help protect the king and maintain control of central squares. Moving the bishop to e4 would attack the white queen on d3, but might leave my king more exposed.

I think the safest and most positionally sound move is to protect my king by moving the knight to e7.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

After analyzing the legal moves, I notice that White's queen and rook are creating significant pressure. I need to make a move that improves my position and defends against potential threats.

The knight on f2 has several interesting options, including the possibility to attack White's queen on d3. However, I need to be careful about leaving other pieces undefended.

After careful consideration, I think the best move is to play 'f2d3', capturing White's queen with my knight. This removes White's strongest attacking piece and improves my position significantly.

Looking at the available moves, I need to make a decision based on the position. I notice that:

1. I have several pawn moves available

3. I can move my knight from f2 to various squares
4. I can move my rook on a8 to b8

Given that White's rook is on e1 and targeting the e-file, and my king is on e8, I should prioritize king safety. Moving the king to f8 would be risky as it could lead to discovered attacks. Moving to d8 looks safer and maintains control of the center.

I'll make the move:

After analyzing the available moves, I notice that my bishop on e7 has several good options, and my knight on f2 is also quite active. 

Given that White's bishop on f6 is threatening my position, and considering the overall structure, I think it's best to move my bishop to f6, which will:
1. Exchange bishops
2. Remove White's active bishop
3. Maintain control of important central squares

I'll make this move:

Let me analyze the position and the available moves:

1. I notice my king is on e8 and there's a potential threat from White's rooks on e5 and h8.
2. I have a knight on f6 with several possible moves.
3. My bishop on f2 also has multiple options.
4. I have several pawn moves available.

Given the position, I think it's important to improve my king's safety and maintain control of key squares. One good move would be to castle kingside, which would protect my king and connect my rooks.

Let me analyze the position and the available moves:

1. I notice White's king is exposed on g7, which could be important.
2. I have a knight on f6 with several possible moves.
3. My king is on e8 and seems relatively safe.
4. I have several pawn moves available.

Looking at the possible moves, I think the most strategic move would be to improve my knight's position while putting pressure on White's position. The move Nf6-e4 looks particularly strong as it:
1. Controls central squares
2. Threatens to fork White's pieces
3. Can't be easily driven away by pawns

I'll make this move:

Player_Black (to Proxy):

I apologize for the error. Looking at the board again, I notice I misread the position. The knight I was referring to is actually on f2, not f6. What I see on f6 is a black bishop.

Looking at my legal moves again, I notice I have a knight on f2 that's already in a strong position, threatening White's position. Among the available moves for this knight, Ne4 looks strong as it maintains pressure and controls central squares.

After analyzing the legal moves and the position, I notice that my knight on e4 has several good options. One particularly strong move would be to play Ne4f2+, which is a fork attacking both the white king on g7 and the rook on f1. This would win material.

Looking at the position and available moves, I notice several important factors:
1. My king is on d8 and seems relatively safe
2. I have a knight on f2 that's quite active and could create threats
3. White has a bishop on f4 that's controlling important squares

Among my options, I think it's important to maintain control over key squares and potentially create threats. The knight on f2 is particularly well-placed and could make some strong moves.

After analysis, I think the best move is to play the knight from f2 to e4, which:
- Attacks the center
- Threatens White's pieces
- Maintains good knight positioning
- Can't be immediately attacked by White's pieces

2. I have a knight on e4 that seems to be in a strong central position with multiple options.
3. I have a bishop on f6 that also has several potential moves.

Among the legal moves, I see some interesting possibilities:
- The knight on e4 has several tactical options
- The bishop on f6 could move to e7 to protect the king more
- I could also consider kingside castling with h8g8

After evaluation, I think the most solid move would be to castle kingside, which will bring my rook into play and improve my king's safety.

2. I can move my rook on f8 in multiple ways
3. I have some pawn moves available

Given that my knight on c3 is well-positioned and threatening multiple squares, I think the best move would be to improve my rook's position. The f8-e8 move looks particularly good as it:
1. Connects my rooks
2. Protects the e8 square
3. Maintains flexibility for future plans

Therefore, I will make this move:

Given these considerations, I believe castling kingside is the best move as it will improve my king's safety and help coordinate my rooks.

Let me analyze the position and the available moves:

1. I notice my king is on d8 and I have a rook on g8 that can move.
2. I have a bishop on f6 with several potential moves.
3. I have a knight on c3 that's actively placed in White's territory.
4. Several pawn moves are available.

Looking at the position, I want to improve my piece coordination and potentially create threats. The knight on c3 is particularly interesting as it's deep in enemy territory. One strong move would be to move it to e4, where it would:
- Control important central squares
- Create pressure on f6 and d6
- Be protected by my pawn on c5

Therefore, I'll make this move:

make_move c3e4

1. I notice my king is on d8 and there's pressure on the e-file
2. My knight on e4 is well-positioned and has several good options
3. The f6 bishop also has multiple diagonal moves available

Looking at the possibilities, I think I should improve my knight's position. The knight on e4 can move to c3, which would:
- Attack the white rook on b5
- Maintain control of central squares
- Create a threat that white must respond to

I'll make this move:

Player_Black (to Proxy):

After analyzing the available moves, I notice that my knight on c3 has several strong options. Given that White's king is somewhat exposed on g7, I should look for moves that could help set up an attack.

The move c3e4 (knight from c3 to e4) looks particularly strong because:
1. It controls important central squares
2. It puts pressure towards the kingside
3. It's protected by my pawn on d4
4. It creates threats against White's position

I'll make this move.

Given the position:
- Castling kingside seems like a good idea to improve my king's safety.
- The knight on e4 is well-placed and doesn't need immediate movement.
- The pawn moves don't seem urgent.

I'll choose to castle kingside to improve my king's safety.

The knight on e5 is in a strong central position and has several good options. One particularly strong move would be to attack White's rook on b2 while also threatening other squares. 

I'll make this move:

make_move e4c3

This knight move:
1. Attacks White's rook on b2
2. Controls important central squares
3. Cannot be immediately captured
4. Creates a fork threat between the rook and potentially other pieces

- It develops my piece to a more active square

The most pressing concern is my king's safety. Since my rook on h8 isn't doing much, and the f8 square could be useful for king movement later, I think the best move is to centralize my rook.

After analyzing the legal moves and the position, I notice that my knight on e4 has several options, but I need to be careful as it's an important piece controlling central squares. 

Looking at the position, I see that moving my rook on f8 to g8 would help protect my king and maintain control of the back rank. This seems like a solid, defensive move that improves my position.

Let me analyze the position and the available moves:

1. I notice my king is on d8 and there's a potential threat from White's rook on b2.
2. I have a knight on e4 that has several good options.
3. My bishop on f6 also has multiple moves available.

Looking at the position, I think it's important to improve my knight's position. The knight on e4 can move to c3, which would:
- Attack White's rook on b1
- Create a strong outpost for my knight
- Maintain control of important central squares

I'll make this move:

1. White has a rook on b7 that's quite active
2. My king is on e8
3. I have some pressure on the kingside with my bishop on f6

Let me check what legal moves I have available.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

After analyzing the legal moves, I notice that my knight on c3 has several good options, and I need to be careful with my king's safety given White's active rook.

The most pressing concern is the rook on b7, which is quite threatening. I should consider moves that either defend against potential threats or create counterplay.

One strong move would be to play the knight from c3 to e4, which:
1. Attacks the center
2. Creates pressure towards White's position
3. Maintains control of important squares
4. Can't be easily dislodged

Therefore, I'll make this move:

After analyzing the legal moves and the position, I notice I have several strong options. Given that:

1. My knight on e4 is well-positioned and has multiple attacking options
2. My king's safety is important, and I have castling options
3. The f6 bishop has good diagonal control

I think the best move here is to castle kingside, which will improve my king's safety and connect my rooks. This is a fundamental chess principle in such middle-game positions.

Among the legal moves, I see some interesting options:
- The knight on e4 has multiple attacking possibilities
- The bishop on f6 could move to e7 for better protection of the king
- The rook on h8 could be centralized

After evaluation, I think the best move is to protect my king and improve my bishop's position by moving it to e7.

Looking at the available moves, I notice several interesting possibilities. My knight on e5 has multiple attacking options, and I need to consider the safety of my king as well.

After analyzing the position:
1. The knight on e5 is well-positioned and has several strong moves available
2. One particularly strong move appears to be Ne5f2+, which would attack the white king and potentially win material

I'll make this move as it forces the king to move and gives me a tactical advantage.

2. My knight on f2 has several good options and is currently attacking white's position
3. My bishop on e7 has some diagonal moves available
4. I have some pawn moves that could improve my position

After evaluating the options, I think moving my bishop on e7 to g5 would be a strong move. It increases my control of the center, puts pressure on white's position, and maintains good piece coordination.

After evaluation, I think I should improve my king's safety by castling kingside, which will also connect my rooks. This is a natural developing move that improves my position.

Looking at the position and the legal moves, I notice several key points:
1. My king is on d8 and could use some protection
2. I have a bishop on g5 that's quite active
3. There's a knight on f2 that could be used for attack

One strong move would be to move my bishop from g5 to e7, which would:
1. Protect my king
2. Maintain control of important central squares
3. Create a more solid defensive structure

Therefore, I'll make this move:

Let me analyze the position and the available moves:

1. I notice my king is on d8 and I have a rook on g8 that could be threatened.
2. I have a bishop on e7 and a knight on e4 that could be active pieces.
3. My pawn structure needs attention.

Looking at the legal moves, I see several strategic options. Given that my king's safety is paramount and I have an active knight on e4, I think I should make a move that improves my position while maintaining control.

The knight on e4 seems to have some good options, and moving it to c3 could create threats while maintaining a good position. This move would attack White's position from a new angle and potentially create some tactical opportunities.

I'll make this move:

2. White has two rooks (b7 and d4) that are quite active
3. I have a bishop on e7 and a knight on c3 that could be developed
4. The position seems somewhat cramped

Looking at the legal moves, I see some interesting possibilities:
- I could try to activate my rook with g8f8 or g8e8
- The knight on c3 has several potential squares
- The bishop on e7 has some diagonal moves available

After consideration, I think I should improve my rook's position and create more coordination between my pieces.

I can see that I have three possible moves with my king:
1. d8e8 (moving king one square to the right)
2. d8c8 (moving king one square to the left)
3. d8e7 (moving king one square diagonally down-right)

Given the position, I notice that my king is in check from the white rook on b7. I need to get out of check, and I should choose the safest square. 

Looking at the options:
- e8 is protected by my rook on f8
- c8 is an open file and could be dangerous with the white rook on d4
- e7 would put me in a more exposed position

The safest choice appears to be moving to e8, as it's protected by my rook and keeps my king on the back rank.

2. White has two rooks on b4 and d4, and a bishop on d3
3. I have a knight on c3 that has several potential moves
4. My rooks are on a8 and f8

One of the most important moves I should consider is protecting my king, as it seems somewhat exposed. I notice I can castle kingside with 'f8g8', which would:
- Protect my king
- Connect my rooks
- Develop my rook to a more active position

This seems like the best move in this position.

You are a professional chess player and you play as black. Now is your turn to make a move. Before making a move you can pick one of the following actions:
- 'get_current_board' to get the schema and current status of the board
- 'get_legal_moves' to get a UCI formatted list of available moves
- 'make_move <UCI formatted move>' when you are ready to complete your turn (e.g., 'make_move e2e4')

Let me analyze the position. I'm playing as Black, and I notice my king is on e8 with rooks on both sides. There's a white rook on d4 that could be threatening, and my knight on c3 could be important for defense or attack. Let me check what legal moves I have available.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Let me analyze the available moves:

1. My king has limited movement options, and staying in the back rank seems safer for now.
2. I have several rook moves available, but need to maintain protection of key squares.
3. My knight on c3 has multiple options, including some potentially aggressive moves.
4. I have several pawn moves available on the kingside.

Looking at the position more carefully:
- The white rook on d4 is a concern
- Knight move to e4 could be strong, attacking the white rook and gaining central control
- This would also indirectly protect my d7 pawn

After this analysis, I believe the best move is to play the knight to e4, attacking the white rook and gaining a strong central position.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Looking at the available moves, I need to consider my position carefully. I notice my knight on e4 has several potential moves, and it's currently pinned against my king by the white rook on d4. 

One strong move would be to move my knight to f6, which would:
1. Get out of the pin
2. Protect my king
3. Control important central squares
4. Create a solid defensive position

I'll make this move:

Let me analyze the available moves:

1. I need to be careful with my king's safety, as it's currently on e8.
2. I have several rook moves available with both rooks (on d8 and g8).
3. My knight on f6 has multiple options.
4. I have several pawn moves available.

Looking at the position, I notice that White's rook on d4 is quite active and could be threatening. One strong move would be to challenge it with my c5 pawn, which would either force the rook to move or lead to a favorable exchange.

I'll play:

make_move c5d4

This move:
- Attacks White's rook
- Controls more central squares
- Creates tension in the center
- Forces White to respond

4. There are several pawn moves available

Looking at the position, I notice that:
- My king's position is relatively safe
- The knight on f6 has several potential squares
- I should be careful about White's rook on b2 and bishop on e5

Among the available moves:
- Moving the knight to d5 could be strong as it controls central squares and could threaten White's pieces
- The rook moves don't seem particularly urgent
- Pawn moves need to be considered carefully to maintain structure

After analysis, I believe the best move is to play the knight to d5, as it:
- Controls important central squares
- Could potentially threaten White's pieces
- Improves my piece positioning

I'll make this move:

Looking at the position:
- The white rook on b2 and bishop on e1 are potential threats.
- My knight on d5 is in a strong central position.
- The pawn structure needs consideration.

After analysis, I think the best move is to improve my king's safety by moving it to c8, away from the open g-file where White's rook is. This also maintains control of the d-file.

Looking at the position, I notice that my king is somewhat exposed on the c-file with a white rook on b2. It would be wise to improve my king's safety. Among the available moves, moving the king to d8 would be a good defensive move, as it protects against potential threats along the c-file and maintains control of important central squares.

Let me analyze the position and the available moves:

1. I'm playing as Black and my king is on d8
2. I have a knight on d5 that has multiple options
3. I have several pawn moves available
4. White has a rook on b2 and a bishop on f6 that could be threatening

Looking at the position, I notice that my knight on d5 is quite active and could potentially create threats. Among the knight moves, d5e3 looks particularly strong as it would attack White's bishop on f6 while also potentially threatening other pieces.

I'll make this move:

Looking at the position and available moves, I notice I'm playing as Black and my king is on d8. I have a knight on e3 that has several potential moves, and I need to be careful about White's rook on b2 and bishop on f6.

The most active and threatening piece I have is the knight on e3. Among its options, moving to f5 looks particularly strong as it:
1. Controls important central squares
2. Creates threats against White's position
3. Can't be immediately attacked by White's pieces

Therefore, I'll move my knight from e3 to f5.

Looking at the position, I notice that my king is somewhat exposed and I should prioritize its safety. Among the legal moves, I see I can move my king to e8, which would be a good defensive move and maintain control of the center.

Looking at the knight moves, f5h4 seems particularly strong as it:
1. Attacks the pawn on h8
2. Could potentially fork white's pieces in future moves
3. Moves to a safer square away from white's bishop

I'll make this move:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

As Black, I have several good options for my first move. The most principled responses would be either:
1. e7e5 - Taking control of the center
2. d7d5 - Also controlling the center
3. g8f6 - Developing the kingside knight to a good square

Given that White has played c2c3 (likely preparing for d2d4), I think it's best to immediately contest the center with:

make_move e7e5

This is a classical response that:
- Controls the central squares
- Opens lines for both the queen and king's bishop
- Creates possibilities for counterplay
- Follows good opening principles of controlling the center early

Looking at the position and the available moves, I notice that White has advanced their knight to c3 and has a pawn structure with c3 and d3. As Black, I should focus on controlling the center and developing my pieces.

One of the most natural moves here would be to develop my light-squared bishop to e7, which protects the king, maintains flexibility, and helps control the center. This is a solid developing move that follows chess principles.

Looking at the available moves, I notice I can castle kingside (e8g8), which would be a good move to protect my king and connect my rooks. This is typically a strong move in the opening phase when it's available and safe. The position looks secure enough to castle, and it would help activate my rook on h8.

3. I have several developing moves available

One of the most principled moves would be to castle kingside with 'g8h8', which will:
- Protect my king
- Connect my rooks
- Allow for future kingside operations

Looking at the available moves, I need to consider a few key factors:
1. The white knight on e5 is threatening my position
2. I should aim to complete my development
3. My king's safety needs to be addressed

Among the available moves, I think taking the knight on e5 with my knight from c6 is the strongest move. This removes White's most active piece and improves my position in the center.

After analyzing the position, I think one of the strongest moves would be to play ...Nf6d5. This move:
1. Centralizes my knight
2. Controls important central squares
3. Puts pressure on White's position
4. Can't be easily dislodged as it's protected by my other knight

I'll make this move:

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Looking at the available moves, I need to consider my position carefully. A few key observations:

1. My knights on d5 and e5 are well-positioned in the center, controlling important squares
2. I should be mindful of my king's safety, as White's bishop on h3 could be threatening
3. I should continue development and improve my position

One strong move would be to develop my bishop on e7 to a better square. The move e7f6 looks particularly appealing because:
1. It maintains control of important central squares
2. It protects the g7 pawn
3. It keeps the bishop active and flexible
4. It doesn't weaken my king's position

I'll make this move.

Looking at the position and available moves, I notice I have several good options. My king is currently exposed in the center, so finding a safe square for it would be prudent. Among the available king moves, g8h8 (kingside castling) looks like the safest option as it will get my king to safety and connect my rooks.

4. There appears to be some pressure on the f-file

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Looking at the available moves, I need to make a decision that maintains my strong central control while ensuring king safety. 

The most concerning aspect is White's queen on d4, which is quite active. One strong move would be to challenge it with one of my knights while maintaining protection of key squares.

After analysis, I think moving my knight from e5 to c4 is a strong choice because:
1. It attacks White's queen, forcing it to move
2. The knight remains protected by my other knight on d5
3. It maintains control of important central squares
4. It's a safe square for the knight

I'll play:

make_move c4d2

This move attacks both White's queen and creates a strong tactical threat. If White moves the queen, I maintain control of important central squares with my knights working together. If White captures the knight with the queen, my other knight can recapture, maintaining material equality while improving my position.

After analyzing the position, I think one of the strongest moves would be to play Nd2-e4. This:
- Centralizes my knight
- Attacks the f6 square
- Creates pressure in the center
- Maintains good control over key squares

After analyzing the available moves and the position, I notice that:
1. I have control of some key central squares with my knights
2. The e4 knight is particularly well-placed and has many options
3. The d5 knight is also active and threatening several squares

One strong move would be to increase the pressure in the center and attack the white pawn on d4 while maintaining flexibility. I'll play:

make_move e4c5

This move:
1. Attacks the d4 pawn
2. Controls important central squares
3. Maintains an active knight position
4. Keeps options open for future development

Looking at the position and available moves, I notice I have several tactical opportunities. I have two knights that are well-positioned in the center, and I should try to maintain this control. After analyzing the possible moves, I think it's best to strengthen my position by protecting my king and creating a more solid pawn structure.

I'll make the move:

make_move h8g8

This move helps protect my king by connecting my rooks, which is a fundamental principle in chess. It creates a safer position for my king while maintaining flexibility for future moves.

One particularly strong move would be to activate my bishop on f6 by moving it to e5, where it would control more central squares and put pressure on White's position.

I'll make this move:

One of my main concerns is the white bishop on h6, and I should consider moves that help defend against potential threats while improving my position.

I think a good move here would be to play 'g7g6', which:
1. Creates a defensive pawn structure around my king
2. Prevents the white bishop on h6 from becoming more aggressive
3. Maintains control of the f5 square
4. Keeps my position solid while maintaining flexibility

After analyzing the available moves and the position, I notice that my queen has several good options, and I need to be mindful of the pressure on f7. 

The move I choose should:
1. Improve my position
2. Maintain protection of key squares
3. Potentially create threats against White's position

Among the available moves, I think moving my queen to e7 (d8e7) is a strong choice because:
1. It protects the f7 pawn against the bishop threat
2. It maintains control of the center
3. It keeps the queen active and flexible
4. It allows for future kingside castling if needed

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Given the exposed position of White's king on d3 and my control of the center, I have some strong attacking opportunities. My queen on e7 has several powerful moves available, and combined with my bishop on f4, I can create serious threats.

After analyzing the position, one of the strongest moves appears to be moving my queen to e3, directly attacking the white king and creating a very dangerous pin. This move would force White to respond immediately to the threat.

I'll make this move:

After analyzing the available moves, I notice several strong options:

1. I can capture White's rook with my queen: 'h2h8'
2. I have some strong knight moves from d5
3. My dark-squared bishop on e3 has multiple attacking options

The most straightforward and strongest move appears to be capturing the rook with my queen, as it wins material and maintains control of the h-file.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

I apologize for my confusion. Let me check the board again carefully. I see that White's rook is on h1, not h8. I was misreading the board orientation. Let me check the legal moves again and make a proper decision.

Looking at the legal moves list, I see several good options. Given my bishop on e3 is well-positioned and can make several strong moves, I'll use it to attack. One particularly strong move would be to move the bishop to h6, creating a pin against White's king.

Looking at the legal moves and the position, I notice several strong possibilities:
1. My queen on g2 has many potential moves, including some that could be threatening
2. My bishop on h6 has a nice diagonal and could be used for attack
3. My knight on d4 is well-positioned and protected

After analyzing the position, I think one of the strongest moves would be to move my bishop from h6 to e3, which threatens White's rook on a7 and creates pressure on the light squares around White's king.

Let me analyze the position. I'm playing as Black and I notice several interesting features:
1. My queen is on g2, which is quite active
2. I have a knight on d4 and two bishops
3. White's king is exposed on c3

Let me check what legal moves I have available.

Looking at my available moves, I notice a particularly strong one: 'g2g7'. This move with my queen:
1. Attacks the g7 pawn
2. Maintains control over important squares
3. Keeps pressure on White's position

I'll make this move.

After analyzing the available moves and the position, I notice several key points:

2. The white rook on c7 is threatening my position and needs to be addressed
3. My knight on d4 is well-placed and could be used for attack

One strong move I see is to use my knight to attack the white rook while also threatening a fork. I'll play:

make_move d5c7

This move:
1. Attacks the white rook on c7
2. Is protected by my queen
3. Forces white to respond to the immediate threat
4. Maintains control of central squares

One strong move would be to improve my bishop's position while maintaining control of important squares. The move Bg5-e7 looks particularly good as it:
1. Protects the important e7 square
2. Maintains control of the diagonal
3. Helps in potential kingside castle preparations

I'll make this move:

Looking at the position and available moves, I notice I have my queen on b2 with many possible moves, and my king on f8 needs to be secured. Given that my king is somewhat exposed, I should prioritize king safety.

The move 'f8g7' looks good as it moves the king to a safer square while maintaining control of important central squares. This also helps protect the h7 pawn and gives the king more mobility.

The queen on d4 is particularly well-placed, and I see a very strong move: Qd4xa1. This captures a rook in the corner and maintains pressure on White's position.

Looking at the position and available moves, I notice several important factors:
1. My queen on a1 is very active and could be used for attack
2. My bishop on e7 has several good diagonal moves available
3. My position is relatively safe, but I should look for active moves

After analyzing the available moves, I think the best move would be to use my bishop on e7 to attack along the diagonal. The move e7g5 looks particularly strong as it controls important squares and puts pressure on White's position.

The most threatening move appears to be moving my queen to d4, which puts pressure on White's king and controls important central squares.

Looking at the position and available moves, I notice I have several strong options. My king is relatively safe, and I have good control of the center with my queen on d4. One particularly strong move would be to improve my bishop's position while maintaining control of important diagonals.

I'll play the bishop move c8f5, which develops the piece to an active square, controls important central squares, and maintains flexibility in my position.

1. My queen is on d4
2. I have two bishops on f4 and g4
3. White's king is exposed on c2
4. Material seems roughly equal

Let me check what legal moves I have available.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Looking at the position and the available moves, I notice several strong tactical opportunities. The most striking feature is that my queen on d4 has a direct line to White's exposed king on c2. 

The move that stands out is:

make_move d4d2

This queen move:
1. Attacks White's king directly
2. Cannot be blocked immediately
3. Creates a strong threat that will force White to react
4. Maintains control of the center
5. Keeps my queen active and flexible for future moves

This should put significant pressure on White's position and force them into a defensive stance.

2. Controls the 4th rank
3. Puts pressure on White's position
4. Maintains flexibility for future moves

The rook on e8 is currently undefended and could be better placed. Moving it to h8 would both protect my king's position and maintain control of the back rank. This move would also connect my rooks, which is generally a good strategic principle.

Looking at the position and available moves, I notice I have several important options. The position seems complex with my king on g7. I need to ensure my king's safety while maintaining control of key squares.

After analyzing the position, I think it's best to improve my king's position by moving it to h8, which is a safer square and allows my rook on g8 more flexibility.

Looking at the position and available moves, I notice several important factors:
1. I have two bishops controlling important diagonals
2. My king is relatively safe on g8
3. I have a knight that could be developed to better squares

One strong move would be to improve my knight's position while maintaining control of key squares. The move Nc7-e6 looks particularly strong as it:
1. Develops the knight to a central square
2. Controls important central squares
3. Protects against potential threats
4. Works well with my bishop pair

I'll make this move:

1. Both kings are exposed
2. I have two bishops and a knight vs White's single bishop
3. There's material equality in pawns
4. My rook is well placed on g8

Let me check what legal moves I have available.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

After analyzing the legal moves and the position, I notice that my bishop on h4 has a strong diagonal and could potentially create threats against White's king on e5. I can enhance this pressure by moving my other bishop to g5, which would create a powerful battery aimed at White's king.

The move Bf5-g4 looks particularly strong as it:
1. Maintains control of important diagonals
2. Creates threats against the white king
3. Works in conjunction with my other pieces
4. Maintains flexibility for future moves

Therefore, I will make this move.

Let me analyze the position. I'm playing as Black and I see several interesting pieces: my rook and king on the back rank, my knight on e4, and two bishops on g4 and h4. Let me check what legal moves I have available.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

After analyzing the position and the available legal moves, I notice I have several strong pieces with good mobility. One particularly strong move would be to use my bishop on h4 to attack along the diagonal. 

I'll play:

make_move h4f6

This move accomplishes several things:
1. Places the bishop on a strong central square
2. Controls important central squares
3. Creates pressure on white's position
4. Maintains flexibility for future moves

Let me check what legal moves I have available.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

After analyzing the available moves and the position, I notice I have several strong options. Given that I have a material advantage, I should focus on maintaining control while looking for opportunities to improve my position.

The bishop on d4 has several good diagonals, and moving it to e3 looks particularly strong as it:
1. Controls important central squares
2. Maintains pressure on white's position
3. Can't be easily challenged by white pieces
4. Keeps coordination with my other pieces

Therefore, I'll make this move:

After analyzing the position and the available legal moves, I notice that my bishop on e5 (which was labeled as e3 in the legal moves list) has some strong diagonal control. One particularly strong move would be to place pressure on the white king while maintaining control of important squares.

I'll play:

make_move e3g1

This bishop move to g1 creates a strong diagonal threat against the white king on f2, while also maintaining control over important central squares. This puts White under immediate pressure and limits their king's mobility.

2. My knight on e4 is well-positioned and has many options
3. My bishop on g1 is actively placed and controls important diagonals

Given that my king is somewhat exposed on the g-file, and there's a white pawn on g7 that could be dangerous, I think it's prudent to improve my king's position. Moving to g7 would be risky due to the white pawn there, but moving to f8 looks safe and maintains control of important squares.

Looking at the available moves, I need to make a decision that maintains my position and possibly improves it. I notice that my king on h8 is somewhat exposed, and White's queen on b8 could be threatening. 

A good defensive move would be to protect the king by moving it to g7, which also helps to activate it. This keeps the king safe while maintaining control of the important f8 rook.

Looking at the position and available moves, I notice I have my king on g7 and need to be careful about white's queen on h7. I should prioritize king safety and maintain control of key squares. 

The rook on f8 is well placed, protecting the f7 pawn and controlling the f-file. The knight on e4 is in a strong central position, and the bishop on g1 is also active.

After analyzing the position, I think it's best to improve my king's safety by moving it to g8, getting it away from the edge of the board while maintaining protection of important pawns.

Let me analyze the position and the available moves:

1. I have my king on g8 with a rook protecting it on f8
2. White has their king on d4 and a queen on h7
3. I have a knight on e4 that could make several moves
4. I have a bishop on g1 that could also make several moves

Looking at the position, I notice that my knight on e4 is in a strong position and could make some threatening moves. One particularly good move would be e4f2, which would attack both the white king and queen simultaneously with a fork.

Given that I have a knight on f2 that's well-positioned and could create threats, I'll use it. The move f2h1 looks particularly strong as it attacks White's queen while moving to a safe square.

Looking at the position and available moves, I notice I'm playing as Black and I need to be careful about my king's safety. I have my king on g8 and a rook on f8. The white queen and bishop are threatening from the first rank.

The most pressing concern is protecting against potential threats. Moving my king to h8 (g8h8) looks like a solid defensive move that maintains control and keeps my king safe. This also keeps my rook protected and maintains flexibility for future moves.

Let me check what legal moves I have available.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Let me analyze the available moves:

1. I need to be careful about my king's safety, as White's queen on g1 and bishop on e2 are potentially threatening.
2. My knight on h1 can move to either g3 or f2, which could create some tactical opportunities.
3. I have several pawn moves available.
4. My rook on f8 has multiple options along the back rank.

Looking at the position more carefully:
- Moving my knight to f2 would be strong as it attacks White's queen and bishop simultaneously.
- This fork would force White to move one of these pieces, gaining material advantage.

Therefore, I'll make the knight fork:

Let me analyze the available moves. I need to be careful as White's queen on d1 and bishop on e5 are creating pressure. 

Key considerations:
1. My king's safety is paramount
2. My knight on f6 is protecting important squares
3. I have control of the f-file with my rook

Looking at the position, I notice that my king could be safer with more pawn protection. Moving h7 to h6 would create a safer position for my king while maintaining flexibility.

One of the most important moves I see is to protect my king and maintain control of the back rank. Moving my king to g8 looks like a solid choice as it:
1. Maintains king safety
2. Keeps coordination between my rook and king
3. Doesn't weaken my position

I'll make this move:

1. I'm playing as Black and my king is on g8
2. White's queen is threatening on d4
3. I have a rook on f8 and my king is somewhat exposed
4. White's king is on c3

Looking at my options, I need to prioritize king safety and try to improve my position. Among the legal moves:

1. Moving the king to h8 (g8h8) would be safer, getting out of potential discovered attacks
2. Moving the rook could be dangerous as it's helping to protect the king
3. The knight on f2 has several options but needs to be careful about pinning

After evaluation, I think the safest and most solid move is to move the king to h8, which maintains protection and improves king safety.

Looking at the available moves, I need to be careful as White's queen on d7 is threatening my position. My king's safety is paramount, and I notice I have several defensive options.

The knight on f2 has some good moves available, and moving it could create counter-threats. Among the possible knight moves, I think moving it to d3 could be strong as it attacks White's queen while being protected.

I'll make this move:

make_move f2d3

Looking at the position and available moves, I need to be careful as White has a queen on d4 and a bishop on d1. My king is currently on h8, and I should prioritize its safety.

Among the available moves, moving my king to g8 seems like a good defensive move as it:
1. Keeps my king protected
2. Maintains control of the back rank
3. Moves away from the h-file which could become dangerous

Therefore, I'll make this move:

Let me analyze the position. I'm playing as Black, and I see my king is on f8, with a rook next to it on f6. White's queen is on d7, which could be threatening. I should check what legal moves I have available.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Let me analyze the available moves carefully:

1. My king on f8 has several moves along the back rank (e8-a8)
2. My knight on d3 has multiple options
3. I have pawn moves with a7, h6, and f7
4. The position looks somewhat dangerous with White's queen on d7

The most critical aspect is ensuring my king's safety. White's queen on d7 is threatening, but not directly attacking my king. However, I need to be careful about potential discovered attacks.

Looking at the position, one strong move would be to protect the f7 pawn and create a safer position for my king by playing:

make_move f7f6

This move:
1. Protects the f7 pawn
2. Creates a safe square on f7 for my king if needed
3. Maintains control of important central squares
4. Doesn't allow any immediate tactical shots from White

- Controls important central squares
- Creates pressure towards White's position
- Maintains a safe distance from White's queen

Looking at the position and the legal moves, I notice several important factors:
1. White's queen on f5 is threatening my position
2. My king is somewhat exposed on h8
3. I have a strong knight on e4 that could be used for attack or defense

Given that White's queen is threatening my position, I should prioritize safety while maintaining control. One good move would be to bring my king to a slightly safer square while maintaining rook protection.

I'll make the move:

make_move h8g8

This keeps my king protected, maintains the rook's defense, and allows me to continue controlling important central squares with my knight.

Looking at the position and available moves, I notice I'm playing as Black and have my king on g8 with a rook on f8. The position seems critical with White's queen on c3 and bishop on d4.

One of my main concerns is protecting my king and maintaining control of key squares. The knight on e4 is in a strong position and could be useful for defense or counterplay.

After analyzing the available moves, I think it's best to improve my king's safety by moving it to h8, getting it away from the f-file where White's queen could potentially create threats.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Looking at the position and available moves, I notice that my knight on e4 is attacking White's queen on e5. However, I need to be careful as the queen is protected by White's bishop on d3. 

The most critical aspect of the position is the safety of my king and the potential threats. I see that my king has several moves available along the back rank and down the g-file, but I need to choose carefully to maintain a good defensive position.

Given that my knight is well-placed on e4, putting pressure on White's queen and controlling important central squares, I should focus on improving my king's position while maintaining the pressure.

I think the safest and most constructive move is to improve my king's position by moving it to f8, which maintains control over the important e8 square and stays protected by the rook.

I think one of the safest and most positionally sound moves would be to protect my king by moving it to h8, which also maintains control of important squares.

Among the available moves, I notice that my knight on e5 (shown as e4 in the move list) has several good options. Moving my knight to f2 would be particularly strong as it:
1. Attacks White's king on b2
2. Is protected by my rook on f8
3. Creates a very dangerous threat

Therefore, I will play:

Let me analyze the available moves:

1. My king can move to g8 or h7
2. My rook on f8 can move to g8, e8, d8, or c8 (though c8 would capture White's queen)
3. My knight on f2 has several options: g4, e4, h3, d3, h1, or d1
4. My pawn on a7 can move to b6, a6, or a5
5. My pawn on h6 can move to h5

Looking at the position, I notice that capturing White's queen with my rook (f8c8) would be a very strong move as it would give me a significant material advantage. There doesn't appear to be any immediate threats to my pieces, and the queen isn't protected.

I'll make this capture:

Looking at the position, I have a rook on c8, a king on h8, and a knight on f2, among other pieces. One of the strongest moves appears to be moving my rook to control more of the board while maintaining protection of my king.

I'll move my rook to e8, which controls more central squares and maintains flexibility.

Given that my king is somewhat exposed, I should prioritize king safety. Moving the rook to g8 would help protect the king and maintain control of the g-file. This seems like a solid positional move.

Looking at the position, I need to be careful with my king's safety. I notice I have a knight on f2 that could make some interesting moves. Let me analyze the key aspects:

1. My king is on h8 and can move to g8 or h7
2. I have a knight on f2 with several options
3. I have pawns on a7 and h6
4. White has a bishop on a4 and pawns on b2 and f2

The knight on f2 is currently well-positioned, threatening some good squares. However, I should prioritize king safety. Moving to g8 would be a good defensive move as it gets my king away from the edge of the board.

Looking at the position and available moves, I notice I'm playing as Black and my king is on g8. White has a bishop on e5 and their king is on b2. I have a knight on f2 that's quite active and could be used for attack.

Let me analyze the key aspects:
1. My king is somewhat exposed but not in immediate danger
2. My knight on f2 is in a strong position and has multiple good squares
3. I have pawns on a7 and h6 that could advance

Among the available moves, I think the knight move f2d3 looks particularly strong as it:
1. Maintains control of central squares
2. Puts pressure on White's position
3. Keeps the knight protected from White's bishop

1. It develops a piece
2. It controls important central squares (d4 and e5)

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Looking at the position and available moves, I notice that White has pushed pawns to e4 and b4, and developed their light-squared bishop to b2. As Black, I should focus on controlling the center and developing my pieces.

One of the most natural moves here would be to push e7-e5, which:
1. Controls important central squares
2. Challenges White's pawn on e4
3. Opens lines for my queen and king's bishop
4. Follows classical chess principles of controlling the center in the opening

Therefore, I will make this move:

You are a professional chess player and you play as black. Now is your turn to make a move. Before making a move you can pick one of the following actions:
- 'get_current_board' to get the schema and current status of the board
- 'get_legal_moves' to get a UCI formatted list of available moves
- 'make_move <UCI formatted move>' when you are ready to complete your turn (e.g., 'make_move e2e4')

Looking at the available moves and the position, I notice that:
1. My king's side is somewhat exposed with missing knights
2. White has developed their bishops aggressively
3. I have several good development options

I think it's important to improve my king's safety and continue development. One good move would be to castle kingside, which will protect my king and connect my rooks.

Let me analyze the position. I can see that White has developed their light-squared bishop to b2 and pushed pawns to b4, e4, and g3. As Black, I have developed both knights to c6 and f6, and advanced my e-pawn to e5. I should check what legal moves I have available.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Looking at the available moves and the position, I want to continue with active development while maintaining control of the center. The most logical moves appear to be either developing the dark-squared bishop (f8e7) or advancing d7-d6/d7-d5 to support my central pawn.

Given that White has some pressure on the e5 pawn with their bishop on b2, I think it's best to support this pawn and develop simultaneously. I'll develop my dark-squared bishop to e7, which will protect the e5 pawn and allow for future castling.

One of my priorities should be to castle and get my king to safety. Since I have the opportunity to castle kingside, I'll take it.

2. White has some central control with e4
3. I should focus on development and king safety

One of the most principled moves would be to castle kingside, which will protect my king and connect my rooks. This is particularly important given the semi-open f-file.

2. I need to maintain control of important central squares
3. My king's safety needs to be considered

One of the strongest moves available is to play 'f6e4', attacking White's pawn on e5 while developing my knight to a strong central square. This move also helps control important central squares and puts pressure on White's position.

Looking at the position and available moves, I notice I have several knights in active positions and my king's safety needs to be considered. Let me analyze some key options:

1. The knight on e4 is well-placed and has multiple attacking options
2. The knight on c6 could develop to better squares
3. I need to ensure my king's safety

After evaluation, I think I should improve my knight's position on e4 by moving it to c3, where it attacks white's queenside and puts pressure on d1. This maintains an active piece while potentially creating threats.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Let me analyze the available moves. I notice that:
1. I'm in a relatively early game position
2. My king's position is somewhat exposed with the f8 square empty
3. I have several knight moves available from both c3 and c6
4. Development and control of the center should be priorities

Given these considerations, I think one of the best moves would be to develop my knight to e4 (c3e4), which would:
- Attack the center
- Put pressure on White's position
- Maintain good knight mobility
- Create potential threats

After analyzing the available moves and the position, I notice several key points:
1. I have two knights in active positions (e4 and c6)
2. The e4 knight is particularly well-placed and has many options
3. My king's position could use some attention

One of the strongest moves available appears to be moving the e4 knight to f2, which would fork White's king and rook. This is a tactical opportunity that shouldn't be missed.

Among the legal moves, I think castling kingside (g8h8) is a strong choice because:
- It brings my king to safety
- It connects my rooks
- It's a developing move that improves my position

Looking at the position and available moves, I notice I have several good options. I should focus on developing my pieces and improving my position. The knight on f2 seems to be in a strong outpost position, and I have some good development moves available.

I think one of the best moves here would be to develop my rook on h8 to g8, which helps protect my king and prepares for potential kingside play.

Among the legal moves, I think castling kingside with 'g8h8' is the best move as it:
1. Brings my king to safety
2. Connects my rooks
3. Follows basic chess principles of development and king safety

2. I have a knight on f2 that's deep in White's territory and could be active
3. I have several pawn moves available

Among the possible moves, I think the knight on f2 is in a strong position and could create threats. Looking at the knight's options, moving to e4 looks particularly strong as it:
1. Controls central squares
2. Threatens White's d2 pawn
3. Maintains an active position for the knight

Therefore, I will move my knight from f2 to e4.

Let me analyze the position and the available moves:

1. I notice my king is in the center (e8) and I haven't castled yet.
2. White has developed their pieces and has some activity.
3. I have two knights well positioned, especially the one on e4 which has many good squares.
4. Kingside castling is available (g8h8) and would be a good way to secure my king.

Given these observations, I think the most important priority is to secure my king's safety through castling. This is a fundamental principle in chess - king safety first, especially in the middlegame.

Looking at the legal moves and the position, I notice several important factors:
1. White's knight on e5 is threatening my position
2. My knight on f2 is attacking White's rook on g4
3. I need to be careful about my king's safety

Among the available moves, I think it's important to maintain control over the center and protect against White's threats. The knight on f2 is in a strong position, but I should also consider developing my other pieces.

After analyzing the options, I'll make a developing move while maintaining control:

make_move d8e7

This move:
1. Develops the queen to a safer square
2. Protects the e7 square
3. Maintains flexibility for future moves
4. Keeps an eye on the center

I need to carefully evaluate my options here. The position is quite complex, but I notice several key aspects:

1. My king's safety is a concern with White's queen on f5
2. I have control of some important central squares with my knight on c6 and queen on c5
3. White has some attacking pieces aimed at my kingside

Looking at the legal moves, I notice that my queen on c5 has several good options. One strong move would be to protect the kingside while maintaining control of important squares by moving the queen to e7, which would:
- Protect the kingside
- Maintain control of central squares
- Keep flexibility for future moves
- Help defend against White's attack

3. It forces White to react, giving me initiative

Let me analyze the position. I see that my queen is on h4, and there seems to be some interesting tactical opportunities. Let me check what legal moves I have available.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Looking at the position and the available moves, I notice several important factors:
1. My queen on g5 has many potential moves and is currently quite active
2. There's a white queen on a4 that could be threatening
3. I have a knight on f2 that's deep in white's territory

After analyzing the position, I think one of the strongest moves would be to attack the white king with my queen while maintaining control of important squares. The move g5e5 looks particularly strong as it:
1. Attacks the white king indirectly
2. Controls important central squares
3. Maintains the queen's mobility
4. Keeps pressure on white's position

Let me evaluate the position and the available moves:

1. I notice my queen on e5 is quite active and can control many squares
2. White's queen on a4 is also quite active and could be threatening
3. My king's position seems somewhat exposed
4. I have a knight on f2 that's deep in White's territory

Looking at the available moves, I want to:
1. Maintain control of key squares
2. Keep my queen active while ensuring its safety
3. Potentially create threats against White's position

After analysis, I think one of the strongest moves would be to move my queen to d4, which:
- Maintains central control
- Attacks White's pawn on d3
- Creates pressure towards White's king
- Stays protected by my knight on f2

The pawn on g7 has been captured and replaced by a white pawn, which could be dangerous. I should consider moves that improve my position while maintaining control.

After analyzing the position, I think one of the strongest moves would be to move my queen to f4, maintaining central control while putting pressure on white's position and protecting against potential threats along the f-file.

3. I need to be mindful of not weakening my king's position

Looking at the moves available, I think the best move is to move my queen to g3, maintaining control of important squares while getting out of the attack from White's queen. This move also maintains pressure on White's position and keeps my queen active.

Let me analyze the position and the available moves:

1. My king is on e8 and appears to be relatively safe
2. I notice my queen on g3 has many options and is quite active
3. White's queen is on d4, which is quite central
4. I have a knight on f2 that's threatening some tactical possibilities

Looking at the position, I see that my queen on g3 is well-placed and putting pressure on White's position. One particularly strong move I see is to increase the pressure with the queen while maintaining control of important squares.

I'll play:

make_move g3e3

This move:
1. Maintains control of the third rank
2. Puts additional pressure on White's e-pawn
3. Keeps the queen active and flexible
4. Maintains tactical possibilities against White's king
5. Stays safe from any immediate threats

2. White's queen is on d4, creating pressure
3. My queen on e3 has many possible moves and is actively placed
4. I have a knight on f2 that's deep in White's territory

Looking at the critical aspects:
- I need to ensure my king's safety
- My queen on e3 is well-placed and threatening
- I should maintain control of key squares

After analysis, I believe the best move is to improve my king's safety while maintaining control. I'll move my rook to protect the king:

make_move g8f8

This move:
1. Protects the king
2. Maintains rook activity
3. Keeps control of the f-file
4. Doesn't weaken my position

Looking at the position and available moves, I notice several important factors:
1. My queen on e4 is currently under attack by White's pawn on c2
2. I have a knight on f2 that's actively placed and threatening some squares
3. My king's position needs to be considered for safety

Given that my queen is under attack, I should either move it to a safe square or make a more threatening move that White must respond to. Looking at the queen moves, e5h5 looks particularly strong as it maintains pressure while moving to a safer square and threatens White's kingside.

3. I have a knight on f2 that's deep in white's territory and has several options
4. White's queen is on c3, which I need to be mindful of

Given the position, I think castling kingside would be a good move as it:
1. Brings my king to safety
2. Connects my rooks
3. Develops my kingside rook to a more active position

I'll make this move:

2. I have a rook on g8 that can move to h8, f8, or g7
3. I have a knight on f2 with several options
4. I have several pawn moves available

The position looks somewhat dangerous with White's queen on c3 and bishop on h4. I need to ensure my king's safety and improve my position.

Looking at the position, I notice that my knight on f2 is quite active and is currently pinning White's f-pawn. However, it might be vulnerable there. One of the strongest moves appears to be moving it to h3, which maintains control over important squares and keeps pressure on White's position.

I'll make this move:

Let me analyze the position. I see that White's queen is on c6, which is quite aggressive, and there's a white pawn on g7 threatening to promote. I should check what legal moves I have available.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Let me analyze the available moves:

1. The white pawn on g7 is a major threat that needs to be addressed
2. My king is in the center and could be vulnerable
3. The white queen on c6 is threatening several squares

Looking at the legal moves, I can capture the white pawn on g7 with my rook (g8g7), which would eliminate the immediate promotion threat and maintain control of the g-file. This seems like the most urgent move to make.

I can see that I have three legal moves available:
1. e8f8 - Moving the king from e8 to f8
2. e8d8 - Moving the king from e8 to d8
3. d7e6 - Moving a pawn from d7 to e6

Given that my king is under attack from the white queen on e5, I must move my king to safety. Between f8 and d8, moving to d8 seems safer as it puts more distance between my king and the white queen, and it's also protected by my bishop on c8.

Looking at the position and available moves, I notice that my king is in the center and I have a rook on g7 that could be better placed. One of my priorities should be to improve my king's safety and position my pieces more actively.

Among the available moves, I think moving the rook from g7 to g8 would be a good choice. This helps protect the back rank and maintains control of the g-file while keeping the rook active.

Looking at the position and the available moves, I notice that:
1. My king is on d8 and seems relatively safe
2. White has a strong presence on the d-file with the rook on d4
3. I have several pawn moves available

One of the key principles in chess is to control the center and develop pieces. Given that White has a rook on the d-file, I should try to contest that control. Additionally, I should aim to develop my pieces and improve my position.

Among the available moves, d7d5 looks particularly appealing because:
- It controls central squares
- It challenges White's control of the d-file
- It opens up lines for my bishop and queen

Therefore, I will make this move.

One of the most principled moves would be to develop my bishop to a more active square. Looking at the diagonals, c8-f5 looks particularly strong as it controls important central squares and puts pressure on white's position.

2. My king is on d8 and seems relatively safe
3. White has a queen on h6 that could be threatening

Looking at the legal moves, I see several good options. The bishop on f5 has many possible moves, but I want to maintain its strong position controlling important diagonals. Moving my rooks to connect them would be a good strategic choice.

I'll play:

make_move h8g8

This move connects my rooks, improving my position and maintaining control of the back rank. It's a solid positional move that enhances my piece coordination.

Looking at the position and available moves, I notice several key points:
1. I have a bishop on f5 with several good diagonal options
2. My king is on d8 and seems relatively safe
3. I have rooks on a8 and g8 that could be better positioned

One strong move would be to develop my bishop to c8, which creates a powerful diagonal control and threatens White's position. This move also helps protect my kingside.

2. Maintains central control
3. Keeps my king protected

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Let me analyze the position and the available moves:

1. I notice White's queen is on h1, which could be dangerous for my king
2. My king is in the center file (e8) and could benefit from castling
3. I have several pawn moves available, but need to be careful about weakening my king's position

Given the position, I think the most important priority is to improve my king's safety. Among the available moves, kingside castling (e8g8) isn't available, but I can castle queenside with e8c8. However, that move isn't listed in the legal moves, suggesting there might be pieces in the way or other restrictions.

The most solid move appears to be:

make_move e8f8

This moves my king towards the kingside where my pawn structure is more intact, and it's a step towards potentially securing the king's safety. It also maintains flexibility for future moves while avoiding any immediate tactical threats.

Looking at the position and the available moves, I notice that my king is on f8 and I have several tactical opportunities. One of the most important aspects is ensuring my king's safety while maintaining control of key squares.

The move f8e8 looks particularly good as it:
1. Moves my king to a safer square
2. Clears the f8 square for potential rook movement
3. Maintains control of the e-file
4. Doesn't weaken my pawn structure

I'll make this move.

1. Places my rook on an open file

Let me check what legal moves I have available.

Let me evaluate the key moves:

1. The bishop on f4 is attacking along the diagonal and is quite active
2. My king is safe but I should be mindful of any potential threats
3. I have control of the d-file with my rook on d8

One strong move that stands out is moving the bishop from f4 to c8, which would:
- Protect the important c7 pawn
- Move to a safer square
- Maintain control over the important diagonal

I'll make this move:

make_move f4c8

Player_Black (to Proxy):

I apologize for my error. I misread the position. Looking at the board again, the bishop is actually on f5, not f4. Let me correct my move.

The same strategic idea applies, moving the bishop back to c8 to protect the c7 pawn:

Let me analyze the position and the available moves:

1. I have a bishop on g4 that's quite active and could be used for attack
2. My king is relatively safe on e8
3. I have rooks on d8 and g8
4. White has a queen on b2 and a bishop on c3 that could be threatening

Looking at the legal moves, I notice that my bishop on g4 has several good diagonal moves available. One particularly strong move would be g4c8, which pins White's queen to their king. This would create a very strong tactical threat.

Looking at the position and available moves, I notice that:
1. I have a rook on g8 that could be better positioned
2. My king is on e8 with some potential threats to consider
3. I have several pawn moves available

Given that White has a queen and bishop aimed towards my kingside, I should prioritize king safety and good rook placement. The move g8h8 looks solid as it:
1. Maintains rook protection of the 8th rank
2. Slightly improves the rook's position by moving it to the open h-file
3. Keeps defending against potential threats to my king

1. My king is in the back rank and seems relatively safe.
2. I have control of the d-file with my rook on d8.
3. The white queen on b2 and bishop on d1 could be threatening pieces.
4. I notice I have a pawn on e4 that could advance.

Given these observations, I think one of the strongest moves would be to advance my e4 pawn to e3. This:
- Creates a passed pawn
- Increases control of the center
- Threatens to advance further and potentially queen
- Restricts white's pieces

Looking at the legal moves and the position, I need to address the immediate threat from White's queen on h8. I have several options:

1. I can capture the queen with my rook: g8h8
2. I can move my king: e8f8 or e8d7
3. I can interpose with my rook: g8f8

The best move here is to capture the queen with my rook, as it eliminates the immediate threat and gains significant material.

4. Looking at the legal moves, I have several options with my rooks and pawns

Given that:
- My king's position seems relatively safe
- I have control of the d-file with my rook
- The d-file appears to be an important central file

I think the best move would be to maintain control of the d-file while also threatening to penetrate White's position. The move d8d4 looks particularly strong as it:
- Maintains control of the d-file
- Attacks the d3 square
- Could potentially threaten White's king position
- Is safe from immediate capture

One of the strongest moves appears to be moving my rook to d5, which would attack the white king directly and force it to move. This creates an immediate tactical threat.

I'll make this move:

Given that my rook on h8 is currently somewhat passive, and there's an opportunity to control more of the 8th rank, I'll move the rook to g8, which maintains protection of the h7 pawn while gaining more central control.

2. e8d8 - Moving king to the left
3. e8e7 - Moving king down

Given that I have a rook on g8 protecting my king from the right side, and moving down would expose my king to potential threats, I think the safest move is to go left.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Looking at the legal moves and the position, I notice several key points:
1. My rook on g8 has multiple options
2. My king on d8 can move to e8 or e7
3. I have several pawn moves available

Given that White's bishop on e5 is threatening my position, and my king's safety is paramount, I should be careful with my move. Moving the king to e8 would be dangerous due to the bishop's control of that diagonal.

I think the best move here is to protect my king and maintain control of the g-file with my rook by moving it to g7, which also protects the h7 pawn.

Given that there's a white bishop on e8 that could potentially threaten my king, and considering the white knight on c3 that controls important squares, I'll move my king to c8 to get away from the immediate threat and maintain better control of the position.

Looking at the position and the available moves, I notice I have a rook on g7 with several possible moves along the g-file, and I also have pawn moves available. Given that my king is on c8, I should be careful about my next move.

The position seems to be in a late middlegame/endgame stage, and I notice White has a bishop on e5 that could be threatening. I should try to maintain control of key squares and protect my king.

One strong move would be to move my rook to g2, which would put pressure on White's second rank and potentially create threats against White's king on e5. This would be an active move that maintains flexibility while increasing my attacking chances.

I'll make this move:

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Looking at the available legal moves, I need to make a strategic decision. Here's my analysis:

1. My king has one possible move (c8b7), but moving into the b-file might be risky with White's knight nearby.
2. My rook on g7 has multiple options along the g-file.
3. I have three pawn moves available (c7b6, h7h6, and f7f5/f6).

Given that White's king is quite advanced (on f6), and considering my position, I think the best move is to keep control of the g-file with my rook while maintaining pressure on White's king. Moving the rook to g6 would control important squares and put pressure on White's position.

Looking at the position, I notice several key points:
1. My king is on c8
2. I have a rook on g6 that seems to have good control of the g-file
3. White has a bishop on e5 and a knight on d4 that could be threatening

Among my legal moves, I want to maintain control of the g-file with my rook while also ensuring my king's safety. Moving the rook to g4 looks strong as it maintains control of the g-file and puts pressure on White's position.

2. I have a rook on g4 which is quite active

Looking at the legal moves, I notice I can attack White's knight on d4 with my rook. This seems like a strong move as it puts pressure on a key piece and maintains control of the g-file.

I'll make this move:

1. Controls the 7th rank
2. Restricts the White king's movement
3. Protects my pawn on f7

Looking at the position and the available moves, I notice I have a rook on e7 that has a lot of mobility. Given that the white king is on g7, I can use my rook to control important squares and potentially set up a checkmate. 

The most active and threatening move appears to be moving my rook to e2, which will control the second rank and put pressure on white's position while maintaining protection of my pawn on f7.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Looking at the legal moves and analyzing the position:

1. My king is currently safe but somewhat restricted
2. I have a rook on e1 with many possible moves
3. White's king is on g7, which could be vulnerable to checks
4. I have a pawn on f7 that could advance

The most promising move appears to be to use my rook to give a check and potentially create a mating threat. Among the rook moves, moving to e7 would deliver check and control important squares.

Among my legal moves, I notice that my rook has several options along the e-file and can also move horizontally to protect my king. Given that White's bishop on h8 is a threat, and my king needs protection, I think the best move is to keep the rook defending the king while maintaining control of the e-file.

I'll move my rook to e6, which maintains pressure and keeps my king safe.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Looking at the legal moves and the position, I notice there's an error in my initial assessment - my rook is actually on e6, not e5. 

Let me analyze the key aspects:
1. My king on c8 can move to d7 or capture the pawn on c7
2. My rook on e6 has multiple options, including moving along the e-file or the 6th rank
3. I have a pawn on f7 that can move to f6

The most critical factors are:
- White's bishop on h8 is controlling the diagonal
- White's king on f4 is relatively exposed
- White's pawns create a structure I need to consider

Given the position, I think the strongest move is to use my rook to control more of the board and put pressure on White's position. I'll move my rook to e4, which attacks White's king's position and controls important squares.

Among the available moves, I think moving the rook to e5 (e4e5) is the strongest move because:
1. It captures White's bishop on e5
2. It maintains control of the e-file
3. It puts additional pressure on White's position
4. It's a safe capture as the square is only defended by the pawn on d5

Therefore, I'll make this move:

Looking at the position, I'm playing as Black and I see that:
1. My king is on c8
2. I have pawns on f7
3. White has pawns on a7, c7, d4 and their king is on e4

Among my legal moves:
- I can move my king to d7 or c7
- I can advance my f7 pawn either one square (f6) or two squares (f5)

Given that White's king is quite active in the center, I should try to keep my king safe while maintaining control of key squares. Moving my king to d7 seems like the best option as it:
1. Keeps the king protected
2. Maintains control over important central squares
3. Stays connected with my pawn

Player_Black (to Proxy):

I need to analyze this position carefully. I'm playing as Black with my king on d7, and White's king is on f5. There are several pawns on the board, and I need to make the best move to maintain my position.

Looking at the legal moves:
1. Moving my king: d7e8, d7c8, d7e7, d7c7, d7d6, d7c6
2. Moving my pawn: f7f6

I notice that White's king is quite active and I should be careful not to allow it to get too close to my pawns. I should also try to keep my king active and protect my pawns.

The move f7f6 would weaken my pawn structure and might create weaknesses that White's king could exploit. Among the king moves, I should choose one that maintains control of key squares and protects my pawns.

Moving to e7 (d7e7) looks like the best choice because:
1. It maintains centralization of my king
2. It protects my f7 pawn
3. It keeps flexibility for future moves
4. It doesn't retreat to the back rank unnecessarily

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Looking at the position, I'm playing as Black and my king is on e7. White has a knight on c8 and their king on f6. There's also a white pawn on d4 and a7, and a black pawn on f7.

Among my legal moves, I can move my king to:
- f8 (diagonal up-right)
- e8 (straight up)
- d8 (diagonal up-left)
- d7 (straight left)

Given that White's knight on c8 is controlling d6 and e7, and White's king on f6 controls e6 and e7, I should choose a safe square that gives me the best position.

Moving to f8 would be risky as it could allow White's king to advance. Moving to d7 doesn't improve my position much. Moving to d8 or e8 seems safer, and e8 gives me more central control.

I'll choose:

Looking at the position and my available moves, I need to be careful as White's king is quite active and there's a white knight that could be threatening. 

I notice that my king is currently on e8 and I have a pawn on f7. Moving the pawn forward with f7f6 would weaken my king's protection, so I should avoid that.

Among the king moves available (e8f8, e8d8, e8e7), I should choose one that keeps my king safe and maintains control of important squares. Moving to e7 would bring my king closer to White's king, which could be dangerous.

Between moving kingside (e8f8) or queenside (e8d8), I prefer moving queenside as it takes me away from White's king and knight while maintaining protection of my pawn.

The safest move appears to be:

make_move d8c8

This keeps my king protected while maintaining control over the f7 pawn and gives me the most flexibility for future moves.

- c8d7: Moving diagonally down-right
- c8c7: Moving down

Given that White's king is on f6 and could potentially advance towards my king, I should try to keep my king active and closer to the center while maintaining control of my f7 pawn. The move c8d7 accomplishes this by:
1. Moving towards the center
2. Maintaining control of the f7 pawn
3. Giving me more flexibility for future moves

You are a professional chess player and you play as black. Now is your turn to make a move. Before making a move you can pick one of the following actions:
- 'get_current_board' to get the schema and current status of the board
- 'get_legal_moves' to get a UCI formatted list of available moves
- 'make_move <UCI formatted move>' when you are ready to complete your turn (e.g., 'make_move e2e4')

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Let me start by checking the current state of the board.

Let me analyze the position. I'm playing as Black, and I see my king is on d7 with a pawn on f7, while White has their king on g7 and pieces including a knight on b2 and pawns on a6 and d4.

Let me check what legal moves I have available.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

I need to make a careful decision here. Let me analyze my options:

1. My king has several moves available (d7 to e8/d8/c8/e7/c7/d6)
2. My pawn can move forward (f7 to f6 or f5)

The position is quite critical. White's king is on g7 and their knight on b2 could be dangerous. I need to keep my king safe while maintaining control.

Moving my king to e8 seems like a good choice because:
1. It moves away from White's king
2. It maintains control of the f7 pawn
3. It gives me more flexibility for future moves

I'll make this move:

make_move d7e8

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Looking at the position, I'm playing as Black and I have a king on e8 and a pawn on f7. White has a king on h8, a knight on b2, and pawns on a3 and d4.

I need to be careful with my king's safety. Moving my king to f8 would be risky as it would move closer to the white king. Moving to d8 seems safer as it maintains distance from the white king while staying connected to my pawn.

I'll make the move:

make_move e8d8
