Looking at the position, White has opened with 1.d4. As Black, I have several good options. I'll play the Knight to f6, which is one of the most flexible and popular responses. This move develops a piece, controls central squares, and keeps many options open for different defensive systems (King's Indian, Queen's Indian, Nimzo-Indian, etc.).

Looking at the position, White has played d4 and h4 (an unusual early h-pawn advance). I have my knight on f6. 

I'll play g6 to prepare a King's Indian or Grünfeld setup with a fianchettoed bishop on g7. This is a flexible system that will give me good control over the center and potentially allow me to exploit White's weakened kingside from the early h4 move.

The most natural continuation here is to complete my kingside fianchetto by developing my dark-squared bishop to g7, which will provide good control over the long diagonal and prepare for castling.

Looking at the position, I can see that both sides haven't castled yet. Black has a typical King's Indian/Modern Defense formation with the fianchettoed bishop on g7 and knight on f6. White's queen is developed early to d2.

Given the position, the most natural and safe move is to castle kingside and get my king to safety. This is a standard principle in the opening - castle early and get the king safe before initiating any tactical operations.

Looking at the position, I see that White has a strong pawn center with d4 and has advanced the h-pawn to h4. My kingside is well-defended with the fianchettoed bishop on g7, but my queenside pieces are still undeveloped.

I notice that White's knight on c3 is the only piece defending the e4 square. This presents an excellent opportunity to place my knight on a strong central outpost.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Looking at the position, White has played 1.b3 (Larsen's Opening or Nimzo-Larsen Attack). This is a relatively uncommon but playable opening where White aims to fianchetto the bishop on b2.

As Black, I should respond with principled chess - controlling the center and developing my pieces. Among the available moves, I'll play:

make_move e7e5

This move:
1. Controls the center with a pawn
2. Opens lines for my bishop and queen
3. Prepares to develop my pieces naturally
4. Is one of the most common and sound responses to 1.b3

Looking at the position, I see that Black has already developed the knight to f6 and played ...e5. White has played b3 and h3, likely preparing to fianchetto the light-squared bishop.

For Black's development, I should continue bringing out pieces and prepare to castle. The most natural move here is to develop the queenside knight to support the e5 pawn and continue piece development.

Looking at the position, I see that White's bishop on e5 is attacking my knight on f6. This is a significant threat I need to address. 

My best option is to capture the bishop with my c6 knight, which will eliminate the threat and give me the advantage of the bishop pair.

I can see the current position. Black has a knight on f2 which is very close to White's king on e1. This looks like a tactical position. Let me check what legal moves are available.

You are a professional chess player and you play as black. Now is your turn to make a move. Before making a move you can pick one of the following actions:
- 'get_current_board' to get the schema and current status of the board
- 'get_legal_moves' to get a UCI formatted list of available moves
- 'make_move <UCI formatted move>' when you are ready to complete your turn (e.g., 'make_move e2e4')

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Looking at the position, I see my knight on g2 is very actively placed. White has doubled rooks on the h-file (h3 and h6), which could be a potential threat. However, I can take advantage of this by playing an aggressive move.

The most forcing move appears to be moving my knight to attack the White rook on h6.

Excellent position! I can see that my knight on g2 has two powerful check options against the exposed White king on e2. 

Looking at the position, I'll play:

make_move g2e1

This delivers check to the White king and forces it to move to a less comfortable square. The knight will be well-placed on e1 to continue creating threats.

Looking at this position, I have a fantastic knight on e1 deep in White's territory. I can see that both e1f3 and e1d3 give check to the White king on e2. 

Let me analyze which check is more forcing:
- After Nf3+, the king has several escape squares
- After Nd3+, the knight controls e1, e3, and f1, severely limiting the king's options

The move Nd3+ appears to be the most forcing continuation, as it controls more critical squares around the White king.

Looking at this dangerous position with White's rooks dominating the 7th rank, I need to eliminate one of these threats immediately. My king on h8 is in serious danger of a back rank mate.

I can see the current position. This is an interesting endgame position where I (Black) have a knight on g1, very deep in White's territory. The White king is on f2, and White has a rook on a8 and some pawns.

Let me check what legal moves are available:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Looking at this endgame position, I have a powerful knight on g1 deep in White's territory, and my rook on g7 can deliver a strong check. 

I see two particularly strong moves that give check:
1. g7g2+ (rook check)
2. g1e2+ (knight check)

The rook check g7g2+ looks very powerful as it would place my rook on the second rank, which is extremely strong in the endgame. This would severely restrict the White king's movement and create serious threats.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Looking at this position, I have a massive material advantage with a queen, two bishops, and a knight against White's rook and knight. Most importantly, I have a knight on g1 that can deliver check to White's exposed king on g2.

I see two immediate checking moves with the knight: g1h3+ and g1f3+. Both are strong, but g1f3+ appears more forcing as it places the knight on a central square where it controls more key squares and coordinates better with my other pieces for a potential mating attack.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Looking at this position, I have a significant material advantage. White has two dangerous passed pawns on a6 and b6 that are quite advanced. I should eliminate one of these threats immediately.

I'll capture the b6 pawn with my c7 pawn, which removes one of White's most dangerous assets while maintaining my material advantage.

Looking at this endgame position, I have a decisive material advantage with a bishop and 5 pawns against White's lone pawn. The key is to convert this advantage efficiently.

I'll activate my bishop by attacking White's only pawn, which will force the white king to defend it and become more passive.

I can see the position. Black has a king on g7, a bishop on d4, and pawns on a6, b4, d5, f7, and h7, while White only has a king on d1. This is a winning endgame position for Black. Let me check the available legal moves.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

I can see I have a significant material advantage with a bishop and several pawns against a lone king. The most forcing move here is to advance my passed b-pawn, which is already far advanced and the White king on d1 is too far away to stop it.

This is a challenging endgame position where White has a significant material advantage with the queen. However, Black has some chances with the passed pawns and active bishop.

I'll make a solid move to improve my position:

make_move h7h6

This move:
1. Prepares to advance the h-pawn further
2. Gives my king more breathing room
3. Maintains flexibility in the position

Looking at this position, I have a huge material advantage with my queen and bishop against the lone white king. The white king on g4 is very exposed, and I should look for a forcing sequence.

Let me analyze the key candidate moves:

The move **f1h3+** looks particularly strong because:
- It gives check from the side
- If the king moves to f4, then Qf3# would be checkmate (the queen would control all the king's escape squares)
- If the king moves to g5, I can continue with checks like Qg3+ or Qh5+

This appears to be the most forcing continuation.

Looking at this endgame position, I have a significant material advantage with a bishop and multiple pawns. The most forcing continuation is to advance my passed h-pawn, which is already quite advanced and the White king cannot stop it.

You are a professional chess player and you play as black. Now is your turn to make a move. Before making a move you can pick one of the following actions:
- 'get_current_board' to get the schema and current status of the board
- 'get_legal_moves' to get a UCI formatted list of available moves
- 'make_move <UCI formatted move>' when you are ready to complete your turn (e.g., 'make_move e2e4')

I'll help you play as black. Let me first check the current board position to understand the game state.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

I can see the position. I'm playing black and have a king on g7, a bishop on d4, and pawns on a6, d5, f7, and h4. White only has a king on h3. This is a winning endgame position for black with a significant material advantage.

Let me check the available legal moves:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Looking at this endgame position, I have a decisive material advantage with a bishop and four pawns against a lone white king. The white king on h3 cannot stop all my passed pawns.

The most straightforward winning plan is to push my f7 pawn to create another passed pawn. This will give me multiple threats that the white king cannot handle.

Looking at the position, I see White has played d4 and developed the knight to the unusual square a3. I've played e5.

Since I can't capture the d4 pawn (it's not in the legal moves), I should focus on development. The most natural move here is to develop my knight to its best square.

Looking at the position, I can see White has played an unusual opening with b4 and Na3. I have good central control with my e5 pawn and my knight developed to f6.

I'll continue with natural development by bringing out my bishop, preparing to castle kingside.

I can see the current position. Black has:
- King on g8 (castled kingside)
- Bishop on b4 and another on c8
- Knight on c6
- Pawn advanced to e5
- Rooks on a8 and f8
- Queen on d8

White's king is still on e1 (uncastled), which could be a target. Let me check what legal moves are available.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Looking at the position, I see that White's king is still uncastled on e1, which presents an opportunity for Black to create pressure in the center. I have several interesting options:

1. **c6d4** - Placing my knight on a strong central square
2. **b4c3** - Capturing to damage White's pawn structure
3. **d7d5** - Opening up the center while White's king is still there

The most attractive move appears to be **Nd4**, which:
- Places the knight on an excellent central outpost
- Puts pressure on White's position
- Threatens various tactical ideas
- Takes advantage of White's uncastled king

Looking at the position, I can see that Black has active pieces with a knight on d4 and bishop on b4. The white king is still on e1, which presents an opportunity.

I notice that the knight on d4 can deliver check with Ne2+. This would force the white king to move and permanently lose castling rights, which would be a significant strategic advantage.

Looking at the position, I can see my knight on g3 is excellently placed. I notice the white king is on d1, which is quite exposed. 

The most powerful move here is **g3f1** - this will check the white king on d1, and the king will be forced to move. This is a very strong tactical blow that will likely win material or create a winning position.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Looking at the position, I can see that Black has developed the bishop to b4 and knight to b5, while White's king is still in the center on d1. This presents an interesting opportunity.

Given that White's king hasn't castled yet, I want to maintain pressure while also ensuring my own king's safety. The move that catches my eye is:

make_move d8h4

This aggressive queen move:
1. Attacks the pawn on h3
2. Puts pressure on the f2 square
3. Creates potential threats along the h4-e1 diagonal
4. Takes advantage of White's uncastled king position
5. Can potentially support an attack with the bishop on b4

This active move fits well with Black's already developed pieces (Bb4 and Nb5) and maintains the initiative.

Looking at the position, White has played 1.Nh3, which is quite an unusual opening move that places the knight on the rim where it has limited influence on the center. As Black, I should take advantage of this by seizing central space.

I'll play the classical central pawn move:

- Develops a piece
- Controls the center
- Prepares for kingside castling
- Follows opening principles

Looking at the position, I notice that White has placed their bishop on a6, which appears to be undefended. Among the legal moves, I can see b7xa6 is available, which would capture this bishop with my b7 pawn.

From the available moves, I'll play a strong developing move that also creates some tactical pressure:

make_move f8b4

This move develops my bishop to an active square while pinning White's knight on c3 to their king. This is a common tactical motif that forces White to deal with the pin, giving me a slight initiative in the position.

I can see the current position. Black has developed both knights to c6 and f6, with a bishop on b4 pinning White's knight on c3. White has pawns on e4 and a3, with a knight on c3. Let me check what legal moves are available.

- Two knights developed on c6 and f6
- A bishop actively placed on c3
- A central pawn on e5 facing White's e4
- My king still in the center

Looking at the position, I see that my king is still in the center while I have pieces actively developed. My bishop on c3 is particularly well-placed, and I have both knights developed. 

Given that king safety is a priority and I have the right to castle, I'll castle kingside to get my king to safety and connect my rooks.

I notice that g4e3+ would be a check, and the knight would be defended by my bishop on c3. This move centralizes my knight while forcing White's king to move, maintaining the initiative.

Looking at the position, I see that White's king on c3 is very exposed, and I have two knights that can deliver check. The knight on e1 can move to c2, which would fork the king on c3 and the rook on a1!

I can see the board position. This appears to be an interesting middle/endgame position where:
- White's king is exposed on b3
- Black has a knight on a2 (likely from a promotion or tactical sequence)
- Material seems roughly balanced but the position looks tactical

Let me check what legal moves are available for Black.

Among the available moves, I see that Qf6+ (d8f6) gives check to the exposed white king. This is a powerful move that:
1. Forces White's king to move
2. Brings the queen into an active attacking position
3. Could potentially lead to further tactical opportunities

Looking at the position, I notice that the white king on b3 is in a very exposed position. My queen on c6 is perfectly placed to deliver a decisive attack.

I can see a forced checkmate sequence starting with Qb5+. After the white king is forced to a2 (the only legal move), I can play Qc4+ which will lead to checkmate in the next few moves.

Looking at the position, I can see that White has a rook on a7 which is quite active. My material advantage includes an extra bishop and three more pawns, so I should look to activate my pieces and create threats.

The most forcing move appears to be challenging the White rook with my own rook. This will force White to retreat and give me control of the 7th rank.

2. Attacks the white knight on g1
3. Creates an immediate threat that White must address

White will be forced to deal with the promotion threat, giving Black a winning advantage.

Looking at the position, I can see I have a material advantage with my bishop. My pawn on b3 is also very advanced and could become dangerous. 

I'll develop my bishop to a more active square where it can control the long diagonal and support my advanced pawn.

- c7c5 would attack White's d4 pawn and create dynamic play
- h6h5 would advance the passed h-pawn
- The bishop is well-placed on the long diagonal

Looking at this position, I see that Black has a very dangerous passed pawn on c2, just one square away from promoting! The white king on c1 is currently blocking its advance.

The key here is to force the white king away from c1 so the pawn can promote. I'll move the bishop to create threats and limit the white king's options.

I see the position clearly. I have a queen and bishop versus White's exposed king and two pawns - a winning advantage. White's king on c3 is vulnerable, and I should look for forcing moves to deliver checkmate.

The most forcing move appears to be a Queen check that limits White's options.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Looking at this endgame position, I need to improve my king activity while maintaining control with my bishop. My bishop on b5 is well-placed, but my king on g7 is somewhat passive.

The most principled move here is to activate my king by bringing it closer to the center and supporting my pawns.

Looking at this endgame position, I can see that my h-pawn on h3 is just one move away from promoting. With the white king on a2 being too far away to stop it, pushing the pawn to promotion is clearly the best move.

I can see this is an endgame position where I (Black) have a significant material advantage with a queen, bishop, and two pawns against White's lone pawn. My queen is actively placed on h1, the white king is on c2, and my king is on f6.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Looking at this endgame position, I have a huge material advantage with my queen and bishop against White's lone pawn. The white king on c2 is quite exposed, and I should look for a forcing sequence to checkmate.

I see an immediate winning sequence: if I play Qd1+, the white king has limited options. If the king moves to c3 (which seems natural), then Qd3 would be checkmate! The bishop on b5 controls the c4 square, and the queen on d3 would control all other escape squares.

I can see this is an endgame position. Black has a king on f6, a bishop on b5, and pawns on d5 and f7, while White has only a king on d1 and a pawn on d4. Black has a significant material advantage.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Looking at this endgame position, Black has a winning material advantage with an extra bishop. The key to converting this advantage is to advance the f7 pawn toward promotion.

The best plan is to use the king to support the f-pawn's advance. Moving the king to g7 prepares to push the f-pawn forward while the bishop controls key squares from b5.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Looking at the position, I see that I have a very advanced pawn on f3 that can move to f2, just one square away from promotion. The white king on d1 is too far away to stop it. This is clearly the winning move.

- My king on g7
- A bishop on d3
- A pawn on d5
- Most importantly, a pawn on f2 ready to promote

Given that pawn promotion is the most forcing and powerful move available, I'll promote to a queen for maximum attacking power.

Looking at this king and pawn endgame, I need to keep my king active and maintain the tension in the center. My d5 pawn is blocked by White's d4 pawn, and the White king on b1 is far from the action.

The best move is to centralize my king and maintain control over the critical squares.

In this type of pawn endgame, king activity and positioning are crucial. I need to keep my king active while protecting my pawn and looking for opportunities to make progress.

I'll play Ke6, which keeps my king centralized and flexible while maintaining protection of my pawn. This move also keeps options open for advancing to f5 or e5 if needed.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Looking at the position, White has played 1.a3 - an unusual opening move that doesn't immediately fight for the center. As Black, I should take advantage of this by claiming central space.

I'll play the most principled response:

Let me check the available legal moves for Black's second move.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Looking at the position, White has played the unusual 1.a3, which doesn't contribute to development or central control. Black has responded well with 1...e5, claiming the center.

For my second move, I'll continue with principled development. The most natural continuation is to develop the knight to f6, where it controls important central squares and prepares to castle kingside.

Looking at the position, White has played very passively with a3 and c3, not contesting the center effectively. Black has already played ...e5 and ...Nf6, which is good development.

Given White's passive setup, I'll take advantage by striking in the center with an aggressive pawn thrust:

I should prioritize piece development and king safety. The most natural move here is to develop my bishop and prepare to castle.

The most natural and principled move here is to castle kingside, which will:
- Put my king in safety
- Connect my rooks
- Complete my basic development

The light-squared bishop on c8 is still undeveloped, which is a priority. I'll develop it to e6, where it supports my d5 pawn and helps control the center.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Looking at the position, I see White has an aggressive knight on g5 attacking my bishop on e6. My king is still in the center, which is a priority to address.

I have several good options here:
- Castling kingside (g8h8) to get my king to safety
- Playing h7h6 to kick the knight away
- Playing f6e4 to centralize my knight

I think the most principled move is to castle and secure my king position first.

Looking at this position, I can see that I have strong central pawns on d5 and e5, but my king is still in the center on f8. White also hasn't castled yet and has an advanced h-pawn on h4.

I notice the e4 square is available for my knight, which would give it an excellent central position. This seems like the most principled move, improving my piece activity while maintaining central control.

- Black has pawns on a7, b7, c7, d5, e5, g7, h7
- Black pieces: Rooks on a8 and g8, Queen on d8, Bishop on e7, Knights on b8 and f2

Looking at the position, I notice my knight on f2 is very actively placed and can deliver a devastating blow!

I can see that my knight can capture the white rook on h1. This would win a whole rook, which is a significant material advantage worth about 5 pawns.

Looking at the position, I can see that my knight on g3 is in a powerful position. I notice that White's king is on e1 and the queen is on d2. This presents an excellent tactical opportunity.

Let me check if I'm seeing this correctly - my knight on g3 can move to e2, which would give check to the White king on e1 while simultaneously attacking the White queen on d2. This is a classic knight fork!

Looking at the position, I can see that:
- My king is still on f8 and hasn't castled yet
- White has advanced pawns on the queenside (a5, b4, c5) 
- I have a central pawn on e5
- White has a knight on e2 and bishops on e3 and f1

I think the most prudent move is to castle kingside to get my king to safety and connect my rooks.

You are a professional chess player and you play as black. Now is your turn to make a move. Before making a move you can pick one of the following actions:

- 'get_legal_moves' to get a UCI formatted list of available moves
- 'make_move <UCI formatted move>' when you are ready to complete your turn (e.g., 'make_move e2e4')

Looking at this position, I can see my knight on e2 is very actively placed. White's king is still on e1 and hasn't castled, which makes it vulnerable.

The most forcing move appears to be moving my knight to g3, which would fork the bishop on f2 and create serious threats near the white king. This tactical blow would put significant pressure on White's position.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Looking at this position, I can see that black has some interesting tactical opportunities. I have a knight on g1 (which is quite unusual and deep in white's territory) and an advanced pawn on d4. The white king is still on e1 and appears uncastled.

The most forcing continuation appears to be pushing my passed pawn forward, which will create immediate threats and put pressure on white's position.

Looking at the position, I see that I have a very well-placed knight on c2 that can deliver checks to the White king on d2. 

I notice that the move c2e1 would give check to the White king and simultaneously attack the White rook on b2. This is a fork that will win material.

Looking at this position, I can see that White has an advanced pawn on c7 that's very dangerous, but I have a knight deep in White's territory on e1. Most importantly, I notice that my e6 pawn can capture White's bishop on d5.

This is a clear opportunity to win material - a bishop is worth about 3 pawns, making this the strongest move available.

You are a professional chess player and you play as black. Now is your turn to make a move. Before making a move you can pick one of the following actions:
- 'get_current_board' to get the schema and current status of the board
- 'get_legal_moves' to get a UCI formatted list of available moves
- 'make_move <UCI formatted move>' when you are ready to complete your turn (e.g., 'make_move e2e4')

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

I'll help you play as black. Let me first check the current board position to understand the game state.

I can see the current position. Black has a significant material advantage with a queen on c1, which is in a very active position. Let me check what legal moves are available.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Looking at this position, I have a huge material advantage with my queen on c1 in a very active position. The white king on e2 is quite exposed, and I can deliver immediate checks.

I see several checking moves available, but c1e1+ looks particularly strong as it will force the white king into an even more vulnerable position. After the king moves, I'll have follow-up checks that could lead to checkmate.
