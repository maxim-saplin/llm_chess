Player_Black (to Proxy):

I can see White has played Nf3, which is a solid opening move. As Black, I have many good options. I'll play a classical response that develops a piece and fights for the center.

make_move g8f6

This develops my knight to f6, which:
- Develops a piece toward the center
- Controls important central squares (e4, d5)
- Prepares for further development
- Is a principled response to White's knight development

- Black has one knight developed to f6
- White is missing the knight that would normally be on b1 (now on c3) and the knight from g1 (now on h3)

Let me check what legal moves are available to me as Black.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Looking at the position and available moves, I can see this is an early opening position. White has played some unusual knight development with Nc3 and Nh3. 

As Black, I should focus on sound opening principles:
1. Control the center
2. Develop pieces toward the center
3. Prepare for castling

Given the options, I'll develop my queenside knight to a strong central square, which also puts pressure on White's advanced knight on c3.

Looking at the position, I can see that White has played some unusual early moves with knights to a4 and h3, which are not optimal squares. This gives me a good opportunity to develop actively and take advantage of White's awkward piece placement.

I'll play a strong central move that develops my pieces and controls key squares.

This move:
1. Controls the center with my pawn
2. Opens up my dark-squared bishop on c8

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Looking at this position, I can see that White has developed a knight to b6, which is quite active. I need to assess the position carefully.

Key observations:
- White has a knight on b6 that's well-placed
- My king is still on e8 (uncastled)
- I have knights on c6 and f6
- White has a knight on h3 as well

I should consider moves that:
1. Improve my piece coordination
2. Address White's active knight on b6
3. Prepare for king safety

The knight on c6 can move to several squares. Moving it to e7 would be solid, supporting the center and preparing potential kingside castling. However, I notice that c6-e5 looks very attractive as it centralizes the knight and puts pressure on White's position.

Let me play:

Looking at the position, I notice that White's king is still in the center and hasn't castled. I should look for tactical opportunities while also considering my own king safety.

I see that my knight on e5 can move to several strong squares. Let me consider the move Ne5-d3, which would fork the king and potentially create threats against White's position.

Let me analyze this position. I can see that:

1. White has a knight on b6 that's quite active
2. My bishop on d7 has good mobility
3. My knight on f6 is well-placed
4. The position looks like it's in the middle game

I notice that White's knight on b6 is somewhat exposed. I can attack it with my bishop from d7. Let me play Bc6, which would:
- Attack the knight on b6
- Put pressure on White's position
- Develop my bishop to a more active square

This move:
1. Develops my bishop to a more active square
2. Puts pressure on White's position
3. Prepares to potentially challenge White's knight on b6

I see that my bishop on d7 has good mobility, and I can develop it actively. The move Bc6 would be excellent as it:
1. Develops the bishop to an active square
2. Controls important central squares
3. Puts pressure on White's position
4. Prepares for potential tactics

Looking at this position, I can see that White has a knight on d4 that's quite centrally placed and potentially strong. I also notice that White has advanced pawns and seems to have some development advantage.

Let me analyze the key features:
- White has a knight on d4 (centralized)
- White has a knight on h3 
- My bishop on c6 is well-placed
- My knight on f6 is active
- White's king appears to still be in the center

I think the most principled move here is to challenge White's central knight. I'll play:

make_move c6d7

This move:
1. Attacks the centralized knight on d4
2. Improves my bishop's position
3. Puts pressure on White's center
4. Maintains good piece coordination

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Looking at this position, I can see that White has advanced pawns on f4 and g4, suggesting an aggressive kingside attack. As Black, I need to be careful about my king safety while looking for counterplay.

Let me analyze the key features:
- White has pawns on f4 and g4, indicating a kingside pawn storm
- My king is still on e8 (uncastled)
- I have a bishop on d7 and knight on f6
- White's king appears to be on e1 (also uncastled)

Given the tactical nature of this position, I should look for active moves. The knight on f6 is well-placed but could be under pressure from the advancing pawns. 

I think **f6e4** is a strong move here - it centralizes my knight to an excellent outpost on e4, where it attacks multiple squares and puts pressure on White's position. From e4, the knight would be very active and could support counterplay.

Looking at this position, I can see that White has advanced pawns on f4 and g4, and I have a knight actively placed on e4. This is a good central outpost for my knight.

Let me analyze some key candidate moves:

1. The knight on e4 has several strong options - it could go to f6 (attacking the g4 pawn), d6 (centralizing), or f2 (forking king and rook)
2. My bishop on d7 could develop to c6 or retreat to c8
3. I could push pawns to gain space

The move Nf2+ looks very attractive as it gives check and forks the king on e2 and the rook on h1, winning material.

Looking at this position, I can see that White has developed some pieces and has pawns on f4 and g4, suggesting an aggressive kingside setup. I have a knight on f2 which is well-placed in White's territory.

Let me analyze the key features:
- My knight on f2 is actively placed and can create threats
- White's king appears to still be in the center
- I should look for active moves that improve my position or create threats

The knight on f2 has several interesting options. Let me consider f2e4, which would centralize the knight and potentially support future tactics, or f2d3 which attacks White's bishop.

After analyzing the position, I think f2e4 is a strong move as it:
1. Centralizes my knight
2. Controls important central squares
3. Keeps pressure on White's position

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Looking at the position, I can see that White has developed their pieces actively with bishops on d2 and e4, and there's tactical tension in the center. I notice that White's king is still in the center on e1, which presents some opportunities.

Let me analyze a few key candidate moves:

1. The knight on e4 is well-placed and can move to several strong squares
2. I should consider developing my remaining pieces
3. White's king position suggests I might look for tactical opportunities

I think the strongest move here is to attack White's advanced pawn structure and create immediate threats:

make_move e4f2

This knight fork attacks both the White king on e1 and the rook on h1, forcing White into a difficult position where they'll likely have to give up material.

Looking at this position, I can see that White has developed some pieces and has a pawn structure in the center. As Black, I need to focus on piece development and controlling key squares.

I notice that my knight on f2 is very actively placed, deep in White's territory. Let me consider the most effective move for this knight.

The knight on f2 can go to several squares, but I'm particularly interested in f2e4, which would centralize the knight on an excellent outpost square, attacking key central squares and potentially supporting future tactical ideas.

This move forks the White king and rook, forcing White into a difficult position where they'll likely have to give up material or accept a very uncomfortable position.

- I have a knight on d2 (which seems to be well-placed) and a bishop on f8
- White has advanced pawns in the center
- My king is still on e8, suggesting I haven't castled yet

Looking at the available moves, I notice I have some interesting tactical possibilities with my knight on d2. The move d2e4 would capture White's bishop on e4, which appears to be a strong central piece.

Let me make this capture:

I notice that my knight on e4 has several good options. Let me look for the most forcing and advantageous move.

The knight on e4 can go to several squares, but **e4d2** stands out as particularly strong because:
- It's a fork that attacks both the white king on e1 and the rook on f1
- This forces White into a difficult position where they must deal with the check first
- I should win material (the rook) after White moves the king

- My knight on d2 is well-placed and can jump to several strong squares
- White has bishops on c2 and e2, and rooks that aren't fully coordinated yet

I think the strongest move here is to activate my knight with a fork. The knight can move to e4, which would attack both the bishop on c2 and potentially create other tactical threats.

Looking at this position, I can see that:

1. White has developed pieces but the king is still in the center
2. I have a knight actively placed on e4
3. White's king on e1 looks vulnerable
4. My pieces need better coordination

Let me look for the most forcing moves. I notice that my knight on e4 is well-placed and can create threats. The move that stands out is **e4d2+**, which would be a knight fork checking the white king and likely attacking another piece.

Let me verify this is the best option by examining what it accomplishes:
- Nd2+ gives check to the white king on e1
- Forces the white king to move
- Creates tactical complications

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Looking at this position, I can see that White has developed pieces actively with a rook on f3, bishop on e3, and queen on d1. My knight is well-placed on d2, and I need to find a good move that improves my position.

Let me analyze the key candidate moves:

1. **d2e4** - This centralizes my knight on an excellent square, attacking White's bishop on e3 and controlling key central squares
2. **d8f6** - Brings my queen into the game, potentially eyeing White's king
3. **e6e5** - Advances my central pawn to gain space
4. **d7c6** - Develops my bishop but seems less forcing

The knight move to e4 looks very strong because:
- It attacks the bishop on e3, forcing White to make a decision
- It centralizes my knight on an ideal outpost
- It increases pressure on White's position
- The knight would be well-supported and difficult to dislodge

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Looking at this position, I can see that White has developed some pieces and has a pawn structure in the center. As Black, I need to continue my development and challenge White's central control.

I notice that White has pawns on d4, e4, f4, g4 creating a strong pawn center, and has developed the bishop to e2 and has rooks that appear active. 

Let me make a developing move that also puts pressure on White's position:

make_move d8f6

This move develops my queen to an active square where it:
1. Attacks the f4 pawn
2. Controls important central squares
3. Prepares to potentially castle queenside
4. Puts immediate pressure on White's pawn structure

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Looking at the position, I can see that White has just played aggressively in the center and my king is still in the center on e8. This is a critical moment where I need to prioritize king safety.

I notice that I can castle queenside (e8c8 is in my legal moves), which would move my king to safety on c8 and bring my rook into the game on d8. This appears to be the most urgent priority given that my king is exposed in the center.

Let me analyze some key candidate moves:

1. **f6f4** - This brings my queen closer to White's king and puts pressure on the center
2. **d7e8** - This would improve my bishop's position 
3. **f6e5** - Centralizes the queen further
4. **d5e4** - Advances my pawn and gains space

The move **f6f4** looks very promising as it:
- Brings my queen to an active square
- Puts pressure on White's position
- Controls important central squares
- Potentially threatens tactics against the exposed white king

Given that White's king hasn't castled and is still in the center, I should look for tactical opportunities. My queen on f4 is perfectly placed to create threats.

I notice that my queen can move to e3, which would give check to the White king on e1 and also attack the queen on d3. This would be a powerful double attack (fork).

Looking at my options, my queen on e3 is in an excellent central position with many possibilities. I notice that I can play Qe3-e2+, which would be check and force a queen trade, but let me look for something more forcing.

I see that Qe3-c1+ looks very strong - it's check and attacks along the back rank where White's king looks vulnerable.

I can see this is a complex middlegame position. Let me analyze the key features:

- My king is on c8, somewhat exposed
- I have rooks on d8 and h8
- I have bishops on f8 and d7
- White has a centralized queen on e2 and appears to have some pressure

Looking at the available moves, I need to prioritize king safety and piece coordination. The move **c8b8** looks very appealing as it:

1. Moves my king to a safer square away from the center
2. Gets the king off the c-file where there might be potential pressure
3. Prepares to potentially connect my rooks or improve my position

Let me analyze this position. I can see that White has a very active queen on e2 and appears to have some tactical threats. I notice that White's king is still in the center on e1, which could be a potential target.

Looking at the position more carefully, I see that White's queen on e2 is quite centralized and potentially dangerous. However, I also notice that my bishop on d7 has some good squares available.

Let me play a developing move that also puts pressure on White's position:

make_move d7c6

This move:
1. Develops my bishop to a more active square
2. Controls important central squares
3. Prepares to potentially castle queenside
4. Keeps my pieces coordinated

Let me analyze this position. I can see that White has a queen on e2 and appears to be in a middlegame position. I have rooks on d8 and h8, bishops on f8 and c6, and several pawn moves available.

Looking at the position, I notice that White's king is on e1 and hasn't castled yet. My bishop on c6 is well-placed, and I should look for tactical opportunities.

Let me examine the move Bxe8+ (which would be c6e8 in UCI notation) - this would be a check, forcing the white king to move and potentially winning material since the rook on f2 would be undefended.

Wait, let me reconsider the board. I see White has a queen on e2 and a rook on f2. The move c6e8 doesn't appear to give check based on the current position.

Let me look for a strong developing move. The move Rd7 (d8d7) would centralize my rook and potentially prepare for doubling on the d-file or supporting the bishop.

Looking at the position, I can see that White has their king on e1 and appears to be in the middle game. I have my king on b8, rooks on h8 and d7, bishops on f8 and c6, and several pawns.

Let me analyze the key features:
- White's king appears to be somewhat exposed on e1
- I have active pieces, particularly my rook on d7
- My bishop on c6 is well-placed
- I should look for tactical opportunities

From the available moves, I notice that my rook on d7 can move to d1, which would be a very strong move as it would attack the White king directly. However, I don't see d7d1 in the legal moves list, which suggests there might be pieces blocking that path.

Looking at the promising moves available:
- d7d8 or d7d6 with the rook
- Moving the bishop from f8 to develop it better
- Pawn advances

I think the most principled move here is to improve my rook's position. Moving the rook to d6 keeps it active and maintains pressure.

Looking at this position, I can see that White has a very active queen on a6 and my king on b8 appears to be in a precarious position. Let me analyze the key features:

1. White's queen on a6 is putting pressure on my position
2. My king on b8 seems somewhat exposed
3. I have a rook on h8 and d6, and bishops on f8 and c6
4. White's king appears to be on e1

I need to prioritize king safety. The move **h8g8** would move my rook from h8 to g8, but more importantly, I should consider getting my king to safety.

Looking at the available moves, **b8c8** would move my king from b8 to c8, which appears to be a safer square and gets the king away from the exposed b8 square.

However, let me also consider **c6d7** which develops my bishop to a more central square, or **d6d7** which advances my rook.

Given the exposed position of my king, I think the priority should be king safety.

Looking at this position, I can see that White has a very active queen on a6 that's putting pressure on my position. My king on c8 is somewhat exposed, and I need to improve my piece coordination.

Let me analyze the key features:
- White's queen on a6 is very active
- My king on c8 needs better safety
- I have a rook on h8 that could be more active
- My bishop on c6 is well-placed but could potentially retreat if needed

I think the best move here is to improve my rook's activity and potentially prepare to challenge White's dominant pieces.

This move:
1. Moves my rook to a more central file

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Let me analyze this position. I can see that White has a very active Queen on b6, which is putting pressure on my position. I have my King on c8, and there's a White Rook on f3 that could become dangerous.

Looking at the available moves, I need to consider:

1. King safety - my King on c8 looks somewhat exposed
2. The White Queen on b6 is very active and threatening
3. I have a Rook on d6 and Bishop on c6 that could be useful

Let me look for the most forcing and safe move. The Queen on b6 is attacking my a7 pawn and potentially creating threats. I should consider moving my King to safety or creating counterplay.

Looking at my options:
- King moves: g8h8, c8d8, c8b8, c8d7
- Rook moves: d6d8, d6d7  
- Bishop moves: c6e8, c6d7, c6b5, c6a4
- Pawn moves: various pawn advances

I think moving my King to d7 would centralize it and get it away from the back rank, while also supporting my pieces. However, c6d7 with the Bishop might be better as it would attack the Queen and force it to move.

Looking at this position, I can see that White has a very active queen on b6 that's putting pressure on my position. Let me analyze the key features:

1. White's queen on b6 is attacking multiple targets
2. My king on c8 looks somewhat exposed
3. I have rooks on d6 and g8, and bishops on d7 and f8
4. White has a rook on f6 that's quite active

I need to find a move that either:
- Improves my king safety
- Challenges White's active pieces
- Creates counterplay

Looking at my options, I think moving my bishop from d7 to e8 would be a good defensive move, getting out of potential tactics and protecting my king. However, I also notice that my rook on d6 could potentially create some activity.

Let me make a move that improves my position:

make_move d7e8

This move:
1. Gets my bishop to a safer square
2. Provides additional protection for my king
3. Clears the d7 square for potential future piece coordination
4. Maintains flexibility in my position

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Looking at this position, I can see that White has a very active queen on b6 that's putting pressure on my position. The queen is attacking multiple targets and controlling key squares.

I need to find a way to deal with this threat. Let me analyze the key candidate moves:

1. **c7c6** - This would attack the White queen and force it to move, while also potentially opening up some space for my pieces.

2. **d6d7** - This would retreat my rook but might not address the immediate pressure.

3. **c8d7** - This develops my king toward safety but doesn't deal with the queen.

4. **e8d7** - Similar to the above, moving the bishop.

The most forcing move appears to be **c7c6**, which attacks the White queen on b6 and forces it to relocate. This gives me tempo and helps me fight for the initiative.

Looking at this position, I can see that White has a very active queen on b5 and a rook on f6 that's putting pressure on my position. My king on c8 looks somewhat exposed, and I need to be careful about tactics.

Let me analyze the key features:
- White's queen on b5 is very centralized and dangerous
- White has a rook on f6 that's quite active
- My king on c8 needs safety
- I have rooks on g8 and d6 that could potentially be more active

Looking at my legal moves, I notice that my rook on d6 can move to d7 or d8, which would help defend along the back rank and potentially prepare to challenge White's pieces.

The move d6d7 looks particularly appealing as it:
1. Moves my rook to a more defensive position
2. Helps protect the 7th rank
3. Keeps my rook active while improving my king safety

1. **c8b8** - Moves my king to safety on the back rank
2. **d7d8** - Activates my rook to the back rank, potentially doubling rooks
3. **f8e7** or other bishop moves - Develops my light-squared bishop
4. **c6c5** - Advances my central pawn to challenge White's position

I think the most pressing need is to get my king to safety and activate my pieces. Moving the rook to d8 would be very strong as it:
- Activates my rook on an open file
- Prepares to potentially double rooks on the d-file
- Supports my position centrally

Looking at this position, I can see that White has a rook on d5 that's quite active, and White's queen on b5 is also well-placed. My king on e8 is still in the center, which could be dangerous.

Let me analyze the key candidate moves:

1. **c8b8** or **c8c7** - Moving my rook to safety and potentially preparing to castle queenside
2. **e8d7** - Moving my king toward safety
3. **f8e7** or **f8d6** - Developing my bishop
4. **c6c5** - Advancing my pawn to challenge White's center

Given that my king is still exposed in the center and White has active pieces, I think getting my king to safety should be the priority. Moving the rook from c8 first would prepare for potential queenside castling.

Looking at this position, I can see that White has a very active queen on b5 and a rook on f6 that's putting pressure on my position. My king on e8 is still in the center, which is concerning.

Let me analyze the key features:
- White's queen on b5 is very centralized and dangerous
- White's rook on f6 is attacking along the 6th rank
- My king is still uncastled and vulnerable on e8
- I need to improve my king safety

From the available moves, I should prioritize getting my king to safety. The move **g8h8** would move my king toward the corner and away from the center, improving its safety.

Looking at this position, I can see that White has a very active queen on c5 and a rook on f6 that's putting pressure on my position. My king on e8 looks somewhat exposed.

Let me analyze the key features:
- White's queen on c5 is very centralized and dangerous
- White's rook on f6 is attacking along the 6th rank
- My king on e8 needs safety
- I have rooks on d8 and h8, and bishops on f8 and e8

The most urgent priority appears to be king safety. I should consider castling queenside (moving my king to c8) or getting my king to a safer square.

Looking at my options, **d8c8** would move my rook from d8 to c8, but **b8c8** would move my rook from b8 to c8. Wait, let me reconsider the board - I think I may have misread it.

Actually, looking more carefully, **d8c8** appears to be moving my rook to give my king an escape route, and **e8d7** would move my king to d7.

Given the pressure from White's pieces, I think the most prudent move is to improve my king safety:

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Looking at the board position, I can see that White has a rook on f6 that's quite active, and there's a White queen on c5. Let me analyze the key features:

1. My king is on b8, somewhat exposed
2. White has a rook on f6 and queen on c5 creating some pressure
3. I have bishops on f8 and d7 that could be useful
4. My rook on h8 could potentially move to safety

I notice that White's rook on f6 is quite aggressive. I should look for moves that either:
- Improve my king safety
- Challenge White's active pieces
- Develop my position

Looking at my options, moving my bishop from d7 seems promising. The move Bf5 (d7f5) would:
- Develop the bishop to a more active square
- Potentially challenge White's central control
- Keep pressure on White's position

Looking at this position, I can see that White has a rook on g5 that's quite active, and my king on b8 is somewhat exposed. I need to improve my position while being mindful of tactics.

Let me analyze the key features:
- My bishop on f5 is well-placed and active
- White's rook on g5 is putting pressure on my kingside
- My rook on d8 could potentially become more active
- My king needs better safety

I think moving my rook from d8 to e8 would be a good choice because:
1. It gets off the d-file where it might face pressure
2. It prepares to potentially support the e-file or swing to the kingside
3. It gives my king a bit more breathing room

Let me analyze the key threats and opportunities:

1. White's Rook on g6 is attacking my h7 and f7 pawns
2. White's Queen on c5 is very centralized and dangerous
3. My King position looks vulnerable
4. I need to find a way to improve my piece coordination

Looking at my options, I think moving my Rook from d8 to e8 would be a good defensive move, as it:
- Moves the Rook to a more active square
- Prepares potential King safety by clearing the d8 square
- Maintains flexibility for future moves

b8c8,b8a8,f8d6

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

I can see this is a complex middlegame position. Looking at the board, I notice:

1. My king is on b8 and can move to c8 or a8
2. My bishop on f8 can move to d6

The White queen on d6 is very actively placed and poses threats. My king appears to be somewhat exposed on the back rank.

Let me analyze the options:
- **b8c8**: Moves the king toward the center, but this could be dangerous with the White queen nearby
- **b8a8**: Moves the king to the corner, which might be safer
- **f8d6**: This would capture the White queen with my bishop - this looks like the best option by far!

The queen is a very valuable piece (worth about 9 points), and capturing it with my bishop would be an excellent trade.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Looking at this position, I can see that White has a rook on f6 that's quite active, and my king on e8 looks somewhat exposed. Let me analyze the key features:

1. White has rooks on b2 and f6, with the f6 rook being particularly aggressive
2. My king is still on e8 and needs safety
3. I have rooks on e8 and h8 that could potentially coordinate
4. My bishop on d6 is well-placed

The most pressing concern is king safety. I should consider castling kingside to get my king to safety and connect my rooks. Looking at the legal moves, I can see h8g8 and e8g8 which would be part of castling kingside.

4. White has rooks on f6 and b2, and bishops on f4 and g2
5. White's king is on c2

I notice that White's king position on c2 looks vulnerable, and I have some tactical possibilities. Let me look for the most forcing move.

The move that stands out is using my bishop on d6. I can play Bc5, which would be a strong centralization move that puts pressure on White's position and potentially creates threats.

Looking at this position, I can see that White has a rook on f6 that's quite active, and my king on g8 looks somewhat exposed. Let me analyze the key features:

1. My king is on g8 with limited mobility
2. White has a rook on f6 that could be threatening
3. I have a bishop on d6 that's well-placed
4. My rooks are doubled on the g and h files

I notice that my bishop on d6 can capture something on f8 (d6f8 is in my legal moves), but that would be moving backwards toward my king. 

More promising looks like advancing my c-pawn or using my bishop more actively. The move d6e7 would centralize my bishop and potentially prepare some counterplay.

However, I think the most principled move here is to improve my king safety first. Let me move my king to a safer square.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Looking at this position, I can see that White has a rook on e6 that's quite active, and my king on b8 seems somewhat exposed. Let me analyze the key features:

- My king is on b8 with limited mobility
- White has a rook on e6 and another on b2
- I have rooks on f8 and h8, and a bishop on e7
- White's king is on d3

I notice that White's rook on e6 is quite centralized and potentially threatening. I should look for ways to challenge it or improve my piece coordination.

The move that stands out to me is **e7d6**, which would:
1. Challenge White's centralized rook on e6
2. Improve my bishop's position
3. Potentially force the rook to make a decision

This move puts pressure on White's active rook and improves my piece coordination.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Looking at this position, I can see that Black is in a complex middlegame. Let me analyze the key features:

- White has a rook on e6 that's quite active
- Black has rooks on b8 and f8, with the king on b8 looking somewhat exposed
- There's a black bishop on d6 that has several good squares
- Black has pawns on a7, h7, c5, d5, and f6

I notice that White's rook on e6 is quite aggressive, and I should look for ways to either challenge it or create counterplay. The bishop on d6 has some interesting options.

Let me play **d6e7**, advancing my bishop to a more active square where it:
1. Attacks the white rook on e6, forcing it to move
2. Controls important central squares
3. Potentially prepares to coordinate with my rooks

Looking at this position, I can see that White has a rook on e5 that's quite active, and my king on b8 seems somewhat exposed. Let me analyze the key features:

- My king is on b8 with limited mobility
- White has a rook on e5 and another on b2
- I have rooks on f8 and h8, and a bishop on e7
- White's king is on d3

I notice that White's rook on e5 is quite centralized and potentially dangerous. I should look for ways to either challenge it or improve my piece coordination.

One strong option I see is **f6e5** - capturing White's active rook with my pawn. This would eliminate a dangerous piece and give me material advantage.

Let me also consider **e7d6** to develop my bishop more actively, or **f8e8** to potentially double rooks on the e-file.

However, capturing the rook seems like the most concrete and beneficial move.

Let me play:

4. White has a rook on e6 which looks quite active
5. White's king is on d3

Looking at the legal moves, I notice several interesting options:

- Rook moves with f8 (many squares available)
- King moves with b8
- Bishop moves with d6
- Pawn advances

The white rook on e6 is very actively placed and could be creating threats. I should look for ways to either challenge it or improve my piece coordination.

I think **f8f3+** would be an excellent move - it gives check to the white king on d3, forcing it to move and gaining tempo while activating my rook to an aggressive square.

- My king is on b8 and appears to be in a somewhat precarious position
- I have a rook on h8 and another on f3
- White has a rook on e6 and bishops that could be creating threats
- My bishop is on d6

Let me analyze the key threats and opportunities:

1. My rook on f3 is very active on the third rank
2. White's king appears to be on d3, which could be vulnerable
3. I need to be careful about my king safety on b8

The most forcing move appears to be using my active rook on f3. I can give check with the rook, which will force White's king to move and maintain the initiative.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

I see there was an error with my move notation. Let me look at the board more carefully and check the legal moves again.

Looking at the position in FEN notation: 1k5r/pP4pp/3bR1P1/2ppp1N1/1P1P4/3KBr2/6BP/R7 b - - 5 58

I can see that my rook is on f3 and White's king is on d3. From the legal moves list, I see that f3f2 and f3f1 are available, which would move my rook along the f-file.

However, I notice that the most forcing continuation would be to give check. Looking at the legal moves, I don't see a direct check with the rook to d3, which suggests there might be a piece blocking or the king isn't actually on d3.

Let me try a strong move that maintains pressure:

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Looking at this position, I can see that White has a rook on e6 and f6, which are creating some pressure. My king is on b8 and I have rooks on h8 and f2. The white king appears to be on d3.

I notice that my rook on f2 has excellent mobility and can create threats. Let me analyze the key candidate moves:

1. **f2f1** - This move puts my rook on the back rank, which could be very strong
2. **f2a2** or **f2b2** - Attacking along the second rank
3. **f2f3+** - This would be check, forcing the white king to move

Let me play the most forcing move:

make_move f2f3

This gives check to the white king on d3, forcing White to respond to the immediate threat and potentially improving my position.

Looking at this position, I can see that White has a rook on e6 that's quite active, and there's a white knight on g6. My rook on f3 is well-placed on the third rank, and I have some tactical opportunities.

Let me analyze the key candidate moves:

1. **f3f1+** - This gives check to the white king on d3, forcing it to move
2. **f3e3+** - Another check, attacking the king directly
3. **f3h3** - Attacks the knight on g6 horizontally
4. **d6f8** - Moves my bishop to safety and potentially prepares counterplay

The most forcing move appears to be giving check. Between f3f1+ and f3e3+, f3e3+ looks more direct as it attacks the king on the same rank.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Looking at this position, I can see that White has a rook on e6 that's quite active, and there's a white knight on g6. My king is on b8 and I have a rook on h8, a bishop on d6, and several pawns.

Let me analyze the key features:
- White's rook on e6 is very active and controlling important squares
- My bishop on d6 is well-placed
- I have some pawn breaks available with my c5 and e5 pawns

I notice that I can capture the white rook on e6 with my bishop. This would be an excellent trade since rooks are generally more valuable than bishops, and that rook is very actively placed.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

I see the issue now. Looking at the legal moves, I notice that capturing the rook on e6 with my bishop isn't available, which means there must be something blocking that capture or the rook isn't actually on e6 as I initially thought.

Looking at the available moves, I can see several good options:

1. `d6e7` - Moving my bishop to a more active square
2. `e5d4` or `c5d4` - Pawn breaks to open up the position
3. `h7g6` - Capturing what appears to be the white knight on g6

The capture `h7g6` looks very appealing as it would win material by taking the knight.

- I have pawns on a7, c5, e4, and g6

Looking at the position, I notice that White has their king on e2, which appears somewhat exposed. My bishop on e3 is well-placed and can potentially create threats.

Let me examine the move e4f3, which would advance my pawn and potentially create threats against the White king while also supporting my bishop.

Looking at this position, I can see:

- My king is on b8 and appears to be in a somewhat exposed position
- I have a rook on h8 with many movement options
- There's a white rook on c6 and another on g2
- I have pawns on a7, g7, c5, and f3
- White has a knight on g5

The most interesting move I see is **f3f2**, advancing my passed pawn on the f-file. This pawn is quite advanced (on the 3rd rank) and pushing it to f2 creates immediate threats:

1. It attacks the white rook on g2
2. It's only one square away from promoting to a queen
3. It forces White to deal with this immediate tactical threat

This appears to be a forcing move that puts pressure on White's position.

- White has a king on e3, rook on c6, knight on g5, and pawns on b4, d4, and h7
- My f2 pawn is very advanced and can promote

The f2 pawn promotion is clearly the most critical move. I need to decide what piece to promote to. In most endgame situations, promoting to a queen gives the most power and winning chances.

Looking at the position, I can see:

- I have pawns on a7, c5, and g6
- White has a rook on c6, a rook on f1, a knight on g5, a king on e3, and pawns on b4, d4, and h7

This appears to be an endgame position. Let me analyze the key features:

1. White's rook on c6 is actively placed
2. White's knight on g5 is well-positioned
3. My rook on h8 has good mobility along the back rank and h-file
4. The pawn structure suggests this is a complex endgame

Looking at my options, I want to activate my pieces and create counterplay. The move c5-c4 looks interesting as it advances my passed pawn and puts pressure on White's position.

Looking at this position, I can see that Black has a very powerful move available - promoting the pawn on c2. Let me analyze the key features:

1. I have a pawn on c2 that can promote to any piece
2. White's king is on f4, somewhat exposed
3. I have a rook on h8 and another pawn on g7 and a7

The pawn promotion on c2 is clearly the strongest move here. I should promote to a queen since it's the most powerful piece and will give me a significant material advantage.

Looking at this position, I can see:

- My king is on b8
- I have a rook on h8
- I have a queen on c1
- White has rooks on f6 and f1, a knight on g5, king on f3, and several pawns

This appears to be an endgame position where I have a material advantage (queen + rook vs rooks + knight). My queen on c1 is very actively placed.

Let me look for the most forcing move. I notice that my queen can potentially create threats against White's exposed king on f3.

make_move c1f4

This move puts my queen on a central square where it:
1. Attacks the White king on f3, forcing it to move
2. Controls key central squares
3. Maintains pressure on White's position
4. Keeps my queen active and well-centralized

Looking at this position, I can see:

- My black king is on b8
- I have a rook on h8 
- White has rooks on f6 and f1, a knight on g5, king on f4, and several pawns

This appears to be an endgame position. Let me analyze the key features:

1. White's king is actively placed on f4
2. White has a rook on f6 that's quite active
3. My king on b8 seems somewhat passive
4. My rook on h8 has many squares available

I should look for active moves. The white king on f4 looks exposed, and I notice that my rook has good mobility. Let me consider a move that creates threats or improves my position.

The move Rh4+ looks very promising - it gives check to the white king on f4, forcing it to move and potentially disrupting White's coordination.

I notice that my rook can move to e4, which would give check to the white king on e3. This forces White to respond to the check and could lead to tactical opportunities.

Looking at this position, I can see:

- My king is on b8 and appears to be in a somewhat precarious position
- I have a rook on e4 that's quite active in the center
- White has rooks on f6 and f1, and a knight on g5
- White's king is on f2

The most striking feature is that my rook on e4 has many options, including some very aggressive moves. Let me analyze the key candidates:

1. **e4e1+** - This gives check to the white king on f2, forcing it to move
2. **e4e2+** - Another check option
3. **b8c7** or **b8b7** - King moves to improve safety
4. **e4h4** - Attacks along the 4th rank

The check with e4e1+ looks very strong as it forces White's king to move and maintains pressure. This seems like the most forcing and advantageous continuation.

- My king is on b8 in a somewhat precarious position
- I have a rook on e4 that's quite active in the center
- White has rooks on f6 and f1, and a knight on g5
- White's king is on g3

The white rook on f6 and knight on g5 are creating some threats. My rook on e4 is well-placed and has many options.

Let me analyze the key candidate moves:

1. **e4e1** - This would put my rook on the back rank, potentially creating threats against White's king
2. **e4h4** - This attacks along the 4th rank and could create threats against White's king on g3
3. **b8c7** - Moving my king to safety
4. **e4e8** - Moving to the back rank but less active than e1

I think **e4e1** is the strongest move here. It puts maximum pressure on White by placing my rook on the first rank, where it can potentially create back-rank threats and force White's king into a more defensive position.

My rook on e1 is in an excellent position, controlling the first rank. I notice that White's rook on f1 is the only piece defending against back rank threats. 

Let me play a move that maintains maximum pressure:

make_move e1a1

This move puts my rook on the a-file, maintaining control of the first rank while potentially creating threats against White's position and keeping maximum activity for my rook.

Looking at this position, I can see:

- My king is on b8
- I have a rook on a1 with many movement options
- I have pawns on a7 and g6
- White has their king on g3, a rook on f3, another rook on g1, and a knight on g5
- There are white pawns on b4, d4, and h3

This appears to be an endgame position. Let me analyze the key candidate moves:

1. **a1g1+** - This would give check to the white king, forcing it to move
2. **a1a2** - Activating the rook along the second rank
3. **b8c7** - Centralizing the king

The check with a1g1+ looks very promising as it forces White's king to move and could disrupt their coordination. In endgames, active piece play and creating threats is often crucial.

- I have pawns on a7 and g6
- I have a rook on g1
- White has their king on h4, a rook on f3, a knight on g5, and pawns on b4, d4, and h3

The white knight on g5 is quite active and could be threatening. My rook on g1 has excellent mobility along the first rank. 

Let me make a move that improves my position by activating my rook and potentially creating threats:

make_move g1e1

This centralizes my rook and gives it good scope along the e-file while keeping my options open for future moves.

Looking at this endgame position, I can see:

- White King on h4
- White Rook on f2  
- White Knight on e5
- White pawns on a7, b4, d4, h2

- Black King on b8
- Black Rook on e1
- Black pawns on d5, g6

This appears to be a complex endgame. My rook on e1 is very active on the first rank, and I need to look for ways to create threats or improve my position.

Let me analyze the key candidate moves:

1. **e1e2** - Attacking the white rook, forcing it to move
2. **e1e4** - Attacking the white pawn on d4
3. **b8b7** - King move, possibly preparing to support the a7 pawn or improve king activity
4. **g6g5** - Pawn advance, potentially creating counterplay

The move **e1e2** looks very strong as it attacks the white rook and forces White to make a decision. This keeps my rook active and maintains pressure.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Looking at this position, I can see several key elements:

1. There's a white knight on e6 that's quite active
2. My rook on e5 is well-placed
3. The white king on g5 is somewhat exposed
4. There are pawns that could advance

Let me analyze the most promising moves:

- `e5e6` would capture the white knight, which is a significant material gain
- `g6f5` would capture the white rook, but that would likely be met with the king recapture
- `e5f5` would capture the white rook directly

Wait, let me look more carefully at the position. The white rook is on f5 and my rook can capture it with `e5f5`. However, I should also consider if capturing the knight with `e5e6` might be better strategically.

Capturing the rook seems like the strongest move since rooks are generally more valuable than knights in most endgames.

Looking at this position, I can see:

- My king is on b8
- I have a rook on h5 
- I have pawns on a7 and g6
- White has their king on g4
- White has pawns on b7, b4, and d4
- White has a knight on e6

This appears to be an endgame position. The white king is quite active on g4, and I need to be careful about my rook placement and king safety.

Let me analyze the key candidate moves:

1. **h5h4+** - This would give check to the white king on g4, forcing it to move
2. **h5e5** - Centralizing the rook and potentially preparing to support my pawns
3. **h5g5+** - Another check option
4. **King moves** like b8b7 to improve king activity

The check with h5h4+ looks very appealing as it forces the white king to move and gives me tempo. This could help me improve my position while putting pressure on White.

I can see this is an endgame position. Let me analyze what's on the board:

**Black pieces (my pieces):**
- King on b8
- Pawns on a7, g6, d5

**White pieces:**
- King on h4
- Knight on e6
- Pawns on b7, b4, d4, h3

This appears to be a complex endgame. Let me check what legal moves are available to me.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Looking at my legal moves, I need to carefully consider this endgame position:

Available moves:
- b8b7 (King takes the white pawn on b7)
- a7a6 (advance a-pawn)
- g6g5 (advance g-pawn) 
- a7a5 (advance a-pawn two squares)

Let me analyze the position:
- White has a dangerous knight on e6 and pawns that could become threats
- My king is somewhat trapped on the back rank
- I have two passed pawns (a7 and g6) that could be valuable

The move **b8b7** looks very attractive because:
1. It captures White's advanced b7 pawn, eliminating a dangerous passed pawn
2. It activates my king, getting it into the game
3. It opens up escape squares for my king

This seems like the most forcing and beneficial move in this position.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Looking at this endgame position, I need to carefully evaluate my options. Let me analyze the key factors:

1. Material is roughly equal (Knight + 3 pawns vs 3 pawns)
2. White has an active knight on e6 that's well-placed
3. My king is somewhat passive on b7
4. I have a potential passed pawn on the a-file
5. White's king is active on g4

My main candidate moves are:
- **a7a5**: Advancing my passed pawn to create threats
- **g6g5**: Attacking White's king and potentially creating counterplay
- **b7c6**: Activating my king toward the center

The knight on e6 is very strong - it controls many key squares and supports White's pawns. I need to create active play.

I think **a7a5** is the strongest move here. It:
- Creates a dangerous passed pawn
- Forces White to deal with the a-pawn threat
- Gives me practical winning chances in the endgame
- The pawn will be hard for the knight to stop if it advances further

I can see this is an endgame position with:
- Black king on b7
- White king on h4
- White knight on e6
- Black pawns on a5 and g6
- White pawns on b4, d4, and h3

This appears to be a critical endgame position. The white knight on e6 is well-placed, and I need to be careful about my king placement and pawn advances.

Looking at my options, I need to consider:
1. King moves to improve my king's position
2. Pawn advances to create counterplay

The white king on h4 seems to be supporting the h3 pawn and potentially targeting my g6 pawn. My a5 pawn could be important for creating counterplay on the queenside.

I think advancing my a-pawn to create immediate threats is the most forcing move:

Looking at this endgame position, I can see:

- Black King on b7
- White King on h4  
- White Knight on g7
- Black pawn on g6
- White pawns on b4, d4, h3
- Black pawn on a4

This appears to be a complex endgame where I need to be very careful. The white knight on g7 is controlling key squares, and I have a passed pawn on a4 that could be valuable.

Let me analyze the key candidate moves:

1. **a4a3** - Advancing my passed pawn closer to promotion
2. **g6g5** - Advancing my other pawn and potentially creating counterplay
3. King moves to improve my king position

The passed a-pawn is my main asset here. Advancing it with a4a3 puts immediate pressure on White and forces them to deal with the threat of promotion. This seems like the most forcing and principled move in this position.

- Black: King on b7, Pawns on d5, g6, a3

This appears to be a critical endgame where I need to carefully evaluate my options. The black pawn on a3 is very advanced and could become dangerous, while the g6 pawn might also have potential.

Let me analyze the key candidate moves:

1. **a3a2** - Advancing the passed pawn closer to promotion
2. **g6g5** - Advancing the other pawn to create counterplay
3. King moves to support pawns or improve position

The a3 pawn is only two squares away from promotion, which makes it extremely dangerous. Advancing it with a3a2 puts immediate pressure on White and forces them to deal with the promotion threat.

I can see my king has several options. Let me analyze this position more carefully:

- I have a dangerous passed pawn on a2 that's very close to promoting
- White has a knight on d6 and pawns on b4, d4, h3
- My king is on b7 and needs to either support my passed pawn or deal with White's threats

The key question is whether I can support my a2 pawn's advance to promotion, or if I need to deal with White's pieces first.

Looking at the position, my a2 pawn is only one square away from promotion, which is extremely valuable. I should try to support its advance.

make_move b7a6

This move brings my king closer to support the a2 pawn while maintaining flexibility. From a6, my king can potentially support the pawn's promotion on the next move if the path is clear.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Looking at this endgame position, I can see:

- Black king on a6
- Black queen on a1  
- Black pawn on d5
- Black pawn on g6
- White king on g3
- White knight on f7
- White pawns on b4, d4, and h3

This appears to be a queen and pawns vs knight and pawns endgame where Black has good winning chances due to the powerful queen.

I notice that the white king looks somewhat exposed on g3. Let me play a move that puts pressure on White's position by centralizing my queen and creating threats.

make_move a1d1

This move:
1. Centralizes the queen on an important file
2. Puts pressure on White's d4 pawn
3. Keeps the white king under observation
4. Maintains flexibility for future tactical opportunities

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Looking at this endgame position, I can see:
- My black king is on a6
- My black queen is on d1  
- My black pawn is on g6
- White has a king on g3, knight on d6, and pawns on b4, d5, and h3

This appears to be a winning endgame for Black with the queen versus knight and pawns. I need to look for the most forcing move.

The white king looks somewhat exposed on g3. Let me play a move that creates immediate threats:

make_move d1g4

This move puts my queen on g4, giving check to the white king on g3 and forcing it to move to a less favorable square, while also controlling key central squares.

Looking at this endgame position, I can see:

- Black King on a6
- Black Queen on g4  
- Black Knight on d6
- Black pawns on d5 and g6
- White King on h3
- White pawns on b4, d4, and h2

This appears to be a winning endgame for Black with the material advantage. I need to look for the most forcing move to convert this advantage.

The White king on h3 looks vulnerable, and my queen on g4 is well-placed. Let me check if I can deliver checkmate or create immediate threats.

Looking at the position, I can see that g4g3+ would be check, forcing the White king to move and potentially leading to mate. Let me verify this is the strongest continuation.

- White Knight on d6  
- Black pawn on g6
- Black pawn on d5
- White pawn on b4
- White pawn on d4
- White King on g3
- White pawn on h3

This appears to be a complex endgame. Let me check what legal moves are available to me as Black.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

I can see I have three legal moves with my king:
- a6a7 (king to a7)
- a6b6 (king to b6) 
- g6g5 (pawn to g5)

Let me analyze this position carefully:

Looking at the position, I have a king on a6, pawns on d5 and g6. White has a king on g3, knight on d6, and pawns on b4, d4, and h3.

The key considerations:
1. My d5 pawn is blocked by White's d4 pawn
2. My king needs to stay active and support my pawns
3. The White knight on d6 is very well-placed, controlling key squares
4. I need to be careful not to allow White's king and pawns to advance too quickly on the kingside

The move g6g5 looks interesting as it:
- Advances my passed pawn
- Creates counterplay on the kingside
- Forces White to deal with my pawn advance
- Potentially creates a race situation

- a6b6 (king to b6) 
- g5g4 (pawn advance)

Let me analyze this position:

The white knight on d6 is very well-placed and controlling key squares. My king is somewhat restricted on the a-file. The pawn endgame aspect is critical here.

Looking at the pawn structure:
- My g5 pawn can advance to create threats
- White has a passed d-pawn that's currently blocked by my d5 pawn
- The white king is relatively far from the action

I think the most active move is to push my g-pawn to create counterplay and potentially distract White from their central pawn majority.

Looking at my two legal moves:
1. `a6a7` - moves my king up the a-file
2. `a6b6` - moves my king toward the center

In this endgame, I need to coordinate my pieces effectively. The black pawn on g3 is quite advanced and could become dangerous. Moving my king to b6 would centralize it better and potentially support my knight and pawns in creating threats against the white king.

I can see this is the starting position of a chess game, with White having made one move - advancing the h-pawn from h2 to h3. This is an unusual opening move that doesn't contribute much to White's development or center control.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Looking at the position, White has played an unusual h3 move which doesn't contribute to development or center control. As Black, I should respond with a principled opening move that controls the center and aids development.

I'll play e7e5, advancing my king's pawn two squares to control the center squares d4 and f4, and opening lines for my bishop and queen.

- White has played c2-c4 (English Opening) and h2-h3
- Black has responded with e7-e5

Let me check what legal moves are available to me as Black.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Now I can see all my legal moves. This is a typical English Opening position where White has played 1.c4 e5 2.h3. 

As Black, I want to develop my pieces actively and fight for central control. The most principled moves here are:

1. **Nf6** - Develops the knight to its best square, attacks e4, and supports central control
2. **Nc6** - Develops the queenside knight and supports the e5 pawn
3. **Bc5** or **Bb4** - Develops the bishop actively

I'll go with the most natural developing move:

make_move g8f6

This develops my knight to its optimal square, puts pressure on the center, and follows classical opening principles of rapid piece development.

Looking at the position, I can see that White has played an early a2-a4 and c2-c4, and my knight is well-placed on f6. I notice that White's king is still in the center and hasn't castled yet.

I want to develop my pieces actively and put pressure on White's position. The knight on f6 has several good options, and I think developing it to a strong central square would be excellent.

make_move f6e4

This move:
1. Centralizes my knight on an excellent outpost
2. Attacks White's bishop on g3 (if there is one) or puts pressure on the center
3. Supports potential tactics and keeps White's king under pressure
4. Follows good opening principles by developing toward the center

- There's a Black knight on e4 (which appears to be well-placed in the center)
- White has made some pawn moves and developed pieces
- Black's kingside knight (originally on g8) is missing from the back rank

Let me check what legal moves are available to me.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Now I can see all my legal moves. Let me analyze the position more carefully:

The knight on e4 is very well-placed in the center and has many good options. I can see several interesting possibilities:

1. **Nf6+** (e4f6) - This would be a knight fork, giving check to the White king and likely attacking another piece
2. **Nd6** (e4d6) - Centralizing further and potentially attacking pieces
3. **Nf2** (e4f2) - A very aggressive move, forking the king and potentially the rook
4. **Ng3** (e4g3) - Attacking pieces on the kingside

Let me go with the most forcing move - the knight fork with check:

I'll develop my knight from b8 to c6, which:
- Develops a piece toward the center
- Supports central control
- Prepares for further development

Looking at the position, I notice that White's early queen development to e3 could be a target. I should focus on developing my pieces with tempo and putting pressure on White's position.

Let me play a developing move that also attacks White's advanced queen:

make_move c6d4

This knight move:
1. Develops my knight to a strong central square
2. Attacks White's queen on e3, forcing it to move
3. Gains tempo in my development

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Looking at the position, I can see that White has developed their queen to f6 quite early, which is generally not ideal as it can become a target. I have two knights well-placed on f6 and d4, and my king is still in the center.

Let me analyze some key candidate moves:

1. **d4e6+** - This knight move gives check and forces the white king to move
2. **d4f5** - Attacks the white queen on f6
3. **e8e7** - Castles kingside to improve king safety
4. **d4e2+** - Another check, forking king and potentially other pieces

The most forcing move appears to be **d4e6+** as it gives check and puts immediate pressure on White's position. This forces White's king to move and disrupts their coordination.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Looking at this position, I can see that White has developed their pieces actively with knights on b1 and g1, bishops on c1 and f1, and rooks on a3 and h1. My pieces are still mostly on their starting squares except for my knights on f6 and g5.

I need to focus on development and central control. Let me analyze some key candidate moves:

1. **e5e4** - This advances my central pawn, gaining space and potentially cramping White's position
2. **d7d6** or **d7d5** - Developing my dark-squared bishop and controlling the center
3. **f8e7** or **f8d6** - Developing my light-squared bishop

The move e5e4 looks particularly strong as it:
- Advances in the center with tempo
- Restricts White's pieces
- Opens up potential tactical possibilities with my well-placed knights

I can see this is an interesting middlegame position. Let me analyze the key features:

- White has advanced a pawn to c3 and has both bishops and knights still on the board
- I have two knights actively placed on f6 and g5
- White's king is still in the center on e1
- I have a pawn advanced to e4

Looking at the tactical possibilities, I notice that my knight on g5 can move to e6, which would be a strong central outpost. However, I also see that my knight on f6 can potentially create threats.

Let me play a move that increases pressure and improves my position:

make_move g5e6

This move:
1. Places my knight on an excellent central outpost
2. Attacks the light-squared bishop on f1 (if it were there) and controls key central squares
3. Supports potential future advances
4. Keeps pressure on White's position

1. Advances my passed pawn closer to promotion
2. Puts pressure on White's position
3. Potentially creates tactical threats

- Black has both knights actively placed on e6 and f6
- White has advanced pawns on a5 and c5, creating some space advantage
- Black has a pawn on e3 that has advanced deep into White's position

The black pawn on e3 is very advanced and could become dangerous. Let me look for the most forcing moves.

I notice that my knight on f6 can move to several squares, and my knight on e6 has good options too. The pawn on e3 advancing to d2 would be very strong, attacking the knight on b1 and getting closer to promotion.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

I can see this is an interesting position where I have a pawn on d2 that can promote! This is a very significant tactical opportunity. Let me analyze the key features:

1. I have a pawn on d2 that can promote to any piece (queen, rook, bishop, or knight) by moving to either c1 or d1
2. I have two knights on f6 and e6 that are well-placed
3. White's king appears to be on f2

The pawn promotion is clearly the most forcing move available. I need to decide between promoting to a queen (most powerful) or potentially a knight (for tactical reasons like checks or forks).

Looking at the position, promoting to a queen on d1 would be very strong as it would:
- Give me a powerful piece
- Potentially threaten the White king
- Control key central squares

You are a professional chess player and you play as black. Now is your turn to make a move. Before making a move you can pick one of the following actions:
- 'get_current_board' to get the schema and current status of the board
- 'get_legal_moves' to get a UCI formatted list of available moves
- 'make_move <UCI formatted move>' when you are ready to complete your turn (e.g., 'make_move e2e4')

I can see the current position. Let me analyze what's happening:

- White has played an early c2-c6, which is quite unusual
- I have two knights developed to e4 and f4, which are very active central squares
- White's king appears to be on f2, which suggests it may have moved early or there's been some tactical sequence
- My king is still on e8 and hasn't castled yet

Let me check what legal moves are available to me:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

I can see I have many options available. Looking at the position more carefully, I notice:

1. My queen is very actively placed on d1, deep in White's territory
2. I have two knights on strong central squares (e6 and f6 based on the legal moves)
3. White's king position looks vulnerable on f2

Given that my queen is on d1 and can give check, let me look for the most forcing move. I can see that Qd1-e2+ is available, which would be check since the White king is on f2.

This check would force the White king to move and maintain the initiative.

- I have two knights on e6 and f6 that are well-placed
- White's king appears to be somewhat exposed on e2
- I have several active piece moves available

Looking at the position, I notice that my knight on e6 can move to d4, which would be a strong central outpost, forking the king on e2 and potentially creating threats. This knight move would also attack multiple squares and improve my position significantly.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

I can see this is an interesting middlegame position. Let me analyze the key features:

- White has a rook on a3 that looks somewhat out of play
- White's king is on e3, which seems quite active but potentially exposed
- I have knights on f6 and d4, with the d4 knight being very well-placed in the center
- My king is still on e8 and needs to find safety

The knight on d4 is excellently placed and I should look for ways to maximize its impact. Let me consider the knight moves:

- d4e6 attacks the bishop on f8 (wait, that's my own bishop)
- d4c6 attacks the b8 square and puts pressure on White's position
- d4f5 is aggressive, attacking the g7 square
- d4e2+ would be a fork, giving check to the king on e3 and attacking other pieces

The move d4e2+ looks very strong as it gives check and creates tactical opportunities.

- White's king is on e3, which seems quite exposed in the center
- I have both knights still in play (on f6 and e2)

The white king on e3 looks very vulnerable. I notice I have a knight on e2 that can potentially create threats. Let me look for the most forcing move.

My knight on e2 can move to several squares, but Nd4+ looks particularly strong as it would be a check, forcing the white king to move and potentially winning material or gaining a strong positional advantage.

Looking at this position, I can see that White has made some aggressive moves with pieces like the queen on a8 and rook on a3. My king is still on e8 and hasn't castled yet. I need to prioritize king safety.

I notice that I can castle kingside (h8g8 is in my legal moves list), which would move my king to safety and activate my rook. This is typically a high priority in the opening/early middlegame.

Looking at this position, I can see that White has developed their pieces aggressively with a bishop on e5 and rooks that appear to be well-placed. I need to assess the most pressing concerns.

I notice that White has a bishop on e5 which is quite active, and my king is still in the center. Let me look for a move that addresses development and king safety.

The knight on f6 is well-placed but could potentially move to create threats or improve my position. The knight on e2 also has several options.

Given the position, I think developing my bishop and getting my king to safety should be priorities. The move f8e7 would develop my bishop while preparing to castle kingside.

Looking at this position, I can see that White has a very active queen on d4 and my king looks somewhat exposed. Let me analyze the key features:

1. White's queen on d4 is centralized and powerful
2. My king on e8 is still in the center 
3. I have a knight on f6 and another on e2 that's quite active
4. White's king on e3 is also somewhat exposed

The knight on e2 is in a very strong position, forking potential targets. Let me look for the most forcing moves.

I notice that my knight on e2 can move to several squares. The move Ne2-d4+ would be a knight fork, giving check to the White king on e3 and attacking the queen simultaneously! This would be devastating for White.

- Gives check to the White king on f4
- Forks the king and potentially other pieces

Looking at this position, I can see that White's king on g5 is in a very exposed position. I have a powerful knight on f6 that can deliver checkmate!

Let me analyze the key tactical shot: if I play Nh5+, this gives check to the White king on g5. Let me verify this is checkmate by checking where the king can move:

- Kf4: Blocked by my knight on e2
- Kf5: Blocked by my pawn on f7  
- Kg4: Blocked by my knight on e2
- Kg6: Blocked by my pawn on g7
- Kh4: Blocked by my pawn on h7
- Kh5: Occupied by my knight
- Kh6: Blocked by my pawn on g7
- Kf6: Occupied by my knight

The king has no escape squares, and the checking knight on h5 cannot be captured by any White piece.

The move **Qf6-f4+** looks very promising as it gives check to the White King on g4, forcing it to move and potentially disrupting White's coordination.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Let me analyze this position. I can see:

1. My king is on e8 and appears to be in a somewhat exposed position
2. I have a queen on f4 which is very actively placed
3. White has a queen on d5 and rook on e6, creating some pressure
4. I have a bishop on g5 and another on c8
5. My knight is on e2, which is deep in White's territory

Looking at the position, I notice that my knight on e2 is very well placed and can create threats. Let me look for the most forcing moves.

I see that my knight on e2 can move to d4, which would be a powerful central outpost, or to g3 which could create threats against the white king.

However, I also notice that my queen on f4 is very active and can potentially create immediate threats.

Let me make a strong move with my knight:

make_move e2d4

This centralizes my knight on an excellent square, attacks multiple pieces, and increases pressure on White's position.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Looking at this position, I can see that White has a very active queen on d5 and my king on e8 looks somewhat exposed. Let me analyze the key features:

1. White's queen on d5 is centralized and powerful
2. My king is still on e8 and hasn't castled
3. I have a queen on f4 that's quite active
4. White's king on h5 looks somewhat exposed too

I notice that my queen on f4 has several attacking possibilities. Let me look for the most forcing move.

I can see that my queen can give check with Qf4-h4+, which would force the White king to move and give me tempo. This looks like a strong tactical shot.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

I can see this is an early position where White has played 1.a3 (the a-pawn has moved from a2 to a3). This is an unusual and relatively weak opening move that doesn't contribute to central control or piece development.

Let me check my legal moves to see my options:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Perfect! I have all the standard opening moves available. Since White played the passive 1.a3, I should respond with a strong, principled move that controls the center and develops my pieces.

I'll play the classical central pawn move:

make_move e7e5

This move:
- Controls the central squares d4 and f4
- Opens lines for my bishop on f8 and potentially my queen
- Follows sound opening principles by fighting for the center
- Takes advantage of White's time-wasting first move

Now I can see my available moves. Looking at the position, White has developed a knight to c3 early, and I have my pawn on e5. This looks like it could transpose into several opening systems.

I'll develop my knight to f6, which is a classical and strong developing move. This knight will control important central squares and support my e5 pawn.

1. White has played an unusual Na3, which is not a typical opening move
2. I have a pawn on e5 and a knight on f6
3. My pieces are still mostly on their starting squares

In this position, I should focus on sound development. The most natural and strong moves would be:
- Developing my queenside knight with Nc6
- Developing my light-squared bishop
- Or advancing in the center

Nc6 (b8c6) is a very natural developing move that:
- Develops a piece toward the center
- Supports my e5 pawn
- Prepares further development
- Follows opening principles

- Most pieces are still on their starting squares

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Now I can see my available moves. Looking at the position, I'm in what appears to be an English Opening or similar system where White has played c4. 

Key considerations:
- My knights are well-placed on c6 and f6
- I have a central pawn on e5
- White's knight on a2 is poorly placed
- I should continue developing and fighting for the center

I think the best move here is to develop my light-squared bishop and put pressure on White's center. The move Bb4+ would be strong, pinning the knight and creating immediate pressure.

Looking at my legal moves, I can see c6b4 which corresponds to Nc6-b4, but I want the bishop move Bf8-b4.

Let me play:

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Looking at this position, I can see that White has played an early c2-c4 and has a bishop on b4. This appears to be an early middle game position where I need to continue my development and improve my piece coordination.

Let me analyze the key features:
- My king is still in the center on e8
- I have knights on c6 and f6 that are well-placed
- My bishop on b4 is actively placed, pinning something or putting pressure on White's position
- I should consider castling for king safety

The move **e8g8** (castling kingside) stands out as a strong option to improve my king safety. However, let me also consider some active piece moves like developing my pieces further or maintaining pressure.

After analyzing the position, I think castling kingside is the most prudent move to secure my king's safety while connecting my rooks.

- I'm playing as Black (pieces on top rows)
- White has advanced some pawns and developed pieces
- I notice White has a bishop on b4, and my king appears to be on g8
- There are some tactical elements to consider

Let me check what legal moves are available to me.

Now I can see my available moves. Let me analyze the position more carefully:

Looking at the board, I notice:
1. White has a bishop on b4 which could be putting pressure on my position
2. I have knights on c6 and f6 that are well-placed
3. My rooks and queen are still on the back rank
4. I have a pawn on e5

I see some interesting tactical possibilities. The knight on f6 can move to several squares, and I notice that Ne4 (f6e4) would centralize my knight very well, attacking from the center and potentially creating threats.

However, let me also consider Ne7 (c6e7) or other developing moves. But f6e4 looks particularly strong as it:
- Centralizes the knight
- Controls important central squares
- Potentially supports future tactical ideas

Looking at this position, I can see some excellent tactical opportunities. My knight on e4 is very well-placed in the center, and I have several strong moves available.

Let me analyze the key options:

1. **e4f2+** - This would be a knight fork, giving check to the white king on e1 and potentially winning material
2. **e4d2** - Attacks multiple pieces and centralizes further
3. **e4c3** - Controls key central squares
4. **b4d2** - My bishop can also attack

The knight fork with check looks very promising. Let me execute this tactical shot:

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Let me analyze this position. I can see that:

1. White has developed pieces actively with knights on g2 and g1, bishops on c1 and f1, and rooks on b1 and h1
2. My king is still on g8 and hasn't castled
3. I have knights on c6 and f2 (the f2 knight is in an advanced, aggressive position)
4. I have a bishop on b4 that's actively placed
5. My queen is on d8 and my rooks are on a8 and f8

The knight on f2 is in a very strong position, forking the king and rook potentially. Let me look for the most forcing moves.

The knight on f2 can move to several squares. Let me consider f2e4, which would centralize the knight and maintain pressure, or f2d3 which attacks the queen, or f2d1 which could be very disruptive.

Actually, f2d1 looks very interesting as it would be a discovered attack and put the knight in a very disruptive position.

Looking at this position, I can see that White has developed some pieces but their king is still in the center on e1. I have a powerful knight on d1 that's deep in White's position, and I should look for tactical opportunities.

- White's king is uncastled on e1
- I have a knight on d1 in an excellent outpost
- I have a bishop on b4 that's well-placed
- White has some development but seems behind in king safety

The move that stands out to me is **d1f2+** - this gives check and forks the king and rook on h1! This is a classic knight fork that will win material.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Looking at this position, I can see several interesting tactical possibilities. Let me analyze the key features:

1. I have a very advanced knight on d1, deep in White's territory
2. I have another knight on c6 that can support tactics
3. My bishop on b4 is well-placed
4. White's king is still on e1, suggesting castling rights may be compromised

The knight on d1 is in an excellent position to create threats. Let me look at the most forcing moves:

- `d1e3` would attack multiple squares and potentially fork pieces
- `d1f2` would be very aggressive, attacking the king area
- `d1c3` maintains central control
- I could also consider `c6d4` to bring my other knight into the attack

Given the advanced position of my knight and White's uncastled king, I think the most forcing continuation is to play the knight to f2, creating maximum pressure on White's position.

I can see the current position. Let me analyze what's happening:

- I'm playing as Black and can see that pieces have been developed
- White has a king on e1, and I notice some tactical possibilities
- There's a black bishop on b4 and a black knight on f2
- The white king appears to be in a vulnerable position

Let me check what legal moves are available to me.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Looking at this position, I can see some very strong tactical opportunities. The white king on e1 is in a precarious position, and I have a knight on f2 that can deliver checks.

Let me examine the key candidate moves:
- f2d1+ would be check, forcing the king to move
- f2h1 attacks the rook 
- f2d3 centralizes the knight
- Various queen moves with the queen on d8

The most forcing move appears to be f2d1, which gives check and forces White's hand. This will likely win material or create a strong tactical sequence.

Looking at this position, I can see some very strong tactical opportunities. I have a knight on d1 that's deep in White's position, and my bishop on b4 is also well-placed. Let me analyze the key candidate moves:

1. **Nd1-e3** - This attacks the king and potentially forks other pieces
2. **Nd1-f2** - This could be a strong fork as well
3. **Bd4-d2** - This attacks along the diagonal and puts pressure on White's position

The knight on d1 is in an incredibly strong position. Let me look at Ne3 - this move would give check to the White king on e1 and potentially create a royal fork.

Looking at this position, I can see:

1. White has developed pieces actively with knights on b4 and g1, and has advanced pawns
2. My king is still on g8 and hasn't castled yet
3. I have knights on c6 and e3 - the knight on e3 is particularly well-placed in White's territory
4. White's king is on e1 and also hasn't castled

The knight on e3 is in an excellent outpost position. Let me look for the most forcing moves. I notice I can give check with my queen from d8.

make_move d8h4

This move puts the White king in check, forcing White to respond to the threat while my queen takes up an aggressive position attacking the kingside.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Looking at this position, I can see that White has just played aggressively with pieces like the knight on b4 and bishop on f1. I have a powerful queen on h4 and knights on c6 and e3 that are well-placed.

Let me analyze the key tactical opportunities:

1. My queen on h4 is in an attacking position
2. My knight on e3 is very well-placed in White's territory
3. My knight on c6 can jump to various squares

I notice that my knight on e3 can move to d1, which would be a powerful fork, attacking both the king on e1 and potentially other pieces. Let me check this move:

make_move e3d1

This knight move to d1 creates a fork, attacking the White king and likely forcing a significant material gain or positional advantage.

Looking at this position, I can see some very promising tactical opportunities. My queen on h4 and knight on d1 are both in excellent attacking positions against White's exposed king on e1.

Let me examine the most forcing moves:

1. The knight on d1 can move to several squares, including e3, c3, f2, and b2
2. My queen on h4 has many options and is eyeing the White king
3. The knight move Nf2+ looks particularly interesting as it would be check

Let me play the most forcing move:

make_move d1f2

This gives check to the White king and creates immediate tactical threats, forcing White to respond to the check while my knight occupies a strong outpost deep in White's position.

Looking at this position, I can see that White has just played a knight to d4, and I have my queen on h4 in an aggressive position. Let me analyze the key features:

1. My queen on h4 is very actively placed
2. White's king is still on e1 (hasn't castled)
3. I have knights on c6 and f2, with the f2 knight in a very advanced position
4. White has some development but the king looks vulnerable

The knight on f2 is in an excellent outpost, and my queen on h4 is eyeing several important squares. I notice that I can create immediate threats against White's exposed king.

Let me play a move that increases the pressure:

make_move h4e1

This move gives check to the White king, forcing it to move and maintaining my initiative with the queen actively attacking.

Looking at the position more carefully, I can see that my knight on f2 is in an excellent attacking position, and I have several strong tactical options.

The knight on f2 can deliver check with f2d1, which would be a powerful move forcing the White king to respond. This would maintain pressure and keep the initiative.

make_move f2d1

This move gives check to the White king on e1, forcing it to move and maintaining my active piece coordination with the knight and queen working together.

I can see the current position. Let me analyze what's happening:

- I'm playing as Black and can see that White's king is on e1
- I have a queen on h4 which appears to be in an aggressive position
- There's a black knight on c6 and another on d1
- White has some pieces developed but the king looks vulnerable

Let me check what legal moves are available to me.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Now I can see my available moves. Looking at the position, I notice that White's king is on e1 and appears to be in a vulnerable position. I have a queen on h4 and a knight on d1, which suggests there might be tactical opportunities.

Let me examine the most forcing moves:

1. The knight on d1 can move to several squares, including e3, c3, f2, and b2
2. My queen on h4 has many options
3. I should look for checks or tactical shots

The knight on d1 moving to f2 (d1f2) would give check to the White king on e1, and this looks very promising as it would be a fork, potentially attacking both the king and other pieces.

Looking at this position, I can see that White has developed pieces aggressively with knights on a4 and g1, and I have my queen actively placed on h4 and knights on c6 and f2. 

Let me analyze some key tactical possibilities:

1. My queen on h4 is well-placed and can create threats
2. My knight on f2 is in an advanced position near White's king
3. My knight on c6 has several good squares available

I notice that my knight on f2 can move to e4, which would be a strong central square, attacking multiple pieces and controlling key squares. This move would also potentially threaten a fork or other tactical motifs.

Looking at this position, I can see that White has developed pieces but there are some tactical opportunities. I notice that White's king is still in the center on e1, and I have active pieces - particularly my queen on h4 and knights on c6 and e4.

Let me analyze the key candidate moves:

1. The White king hasn't castled and is somewhat exposed
2. My queen on h4 is well-placed and attacking
3. My knights are actively placed and can create threats

I see a strong tactical shot: **Nf2+** (knight from e4 to f2 with check). This move:
- Gives check to the White king
- Forks the king and rook on h1
- Forces White into a difficult position where they'll likely lose material

Looking at this position, I can see that White has just played a knight to d4, and I have my queen on h4 in an aggressive position. Let me analyze the key features:

1. My queen on h4 is very actively placed
2. White's king is still on e1 (uncastled)
3. I have knights on c6 and f2, with the f2 knight being particularly well-placed
4. White has bishops on c1 and f1

I notice that my knight on f2 can deliver a powerful discovered check. If I move the knight from f2, my queen on h4 will give check to the White king on e1 along the diagonal.

The most forcing move appears to be moving my knight from f2 to e4, which would:
1. Give a discovered check (queen on h4 checks the king on e1)
2. Attack White's knight on d4
3. Centralize my knight powerfully

I notice that my queen on h4 can give check, and I have a knight on e4 that can support tactical operations. The move that stands out is using my knight from e4 to attack the white king's position.

make_move e4f2

This knight move to f2 gives check to the white king on e1, forcing White to respond to the immediate threat while also attacking the rook on h1. This creates immediate tactical pressure and maintains my active piece coordination.

Looking at this position, I can see that White has a king on e1 and I have a powerful queen on h4 that's very active. Let me analyze the key features:

1. White's king appears to be still in the center (e1)
2. My queen on h4 is in an aggressive position
3. I have knights on c6 and e4 that are well-placed
4. White has a knight on b6 that seems out of play

Given that White's king appears to be in the center and vulnerable, I should look for forcing moves. My queen on h4 has several attacking options, and I notice that I can give check.

Let me play a forcing move that puts immediate pressure on White's king:

make_move h4d8

This move attacks along the back rank and should create immediate threats against the exposed white king.

Looking at the position, I can see:

- White has a king on e1, rooks on a1 and h1, bishops on c1 and f1, and a knight on g1
- Black has a king on g8, queen on d8, rook on f8, bishop on c8, knights on c6 and e4, and several pawns

This appears to be in the middle game. I notice that:
1. My knight on e4 is well-placed in the center
2. My queen on d8 has good mobility
3. White's king appears to still be in the center

Let me look for the most forcing moves. I see that my knight on e4 can move to several strong squares. The move e4f2 looks particularly interesting as it would be a fork, attacking both the king on e1 and potentially other pieces.

Let me check this tactical shot:

Looking at this position, I can see that White has a knight on d4 that's quite centrally placed and potentially dangerous. I also notice that my knight on f2 is very well-placed, deep in White's territory and creating threats.

Let me analyze some key candidate moves:

1. **f2e4** - This centralizes my knight and attacks White's bishop on e2, while also eyeing some key squares
2. **f2d3** - This attacks the bishop and maintains pressure
3. **f2g4** - This keeps the knight active but might be less forcing
4. **c6e7** or **c6d4** - Developing my other knight

The knight on f2 is excellently placed, and I should use it to create immediate threats. The move f2e4 looks very strong as it:
- Centralizes the knight
- Attacks the white bishop on e2
- Controls key central squares
- Maintains pressure on White's position

Looking at this position, I can see that White has their king on e1 and appears to be in a somewhat exposed position. I have two knights actively placed on c6 and e4, which gives me good tactical opportunities.

Let me analyze the key features:
- My queen on d8 is well-placed
- I have active knights on c6 and e4
- White's king appears to still be in the center
- I have a pawn on e5 that's advanced

The knight on e4 is particularly well-placed and can create threats. Let me look for the most forcing move.

The move Nxf2+ looks very attractive - it's a knight fork that gives check to the White king on e1 while also attacking the rook on h1. This would be a powerful tactical blow.

1. **f2e4** - This centralizes my knight and attacks the bishop on c2
2. **f2d3** - This attacks the bishop on c2 and controls important central squares
3. **f2d1** - This could be interesting to disrupt White's back rank
4. **d8e7** or **d8f6** - Developing my queen to a more active square

The knight on f2 is clearly my most active piece right now. Moving it to e4 would centralize it beautifully, attack the bishop, and maintain pressure on White's position.

Let me examine this more carefully - from e4, my knight can go to d2, which would indeed give check to the king on e1. This would be a strong tactical move.

Looking at this position, I can see that White has some tactical threats, particularly with the rook on a3 and the bishop on e2. I need to be careful about my king safety while looking for counterplay.

I notice that my queen on d8 has many options, and there's a knight on d2 that could be creating threats. Let me analyze the key candidate moves:

1. The knight on d2 is well-placed and could jump to strong squares
2. My queen has good mobility
3. I should consider king safety with moves like g8h8

After analyzing the position, I think the most principled move is to improve my king safety while maintaining tactical options.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Looking at this position, I can see that White has some tactical threats, particularly with the knight on f6 and bishops creating pressure. Let me analyze the key features:

1. My king on h8 looks somewhat exposed
2. White has a knight on f6 which is quite strong
3. I have a queen on d8 and rook on f8 that could potentially coordinate
4. There's a knight on d2 that could be creating threats

I notice that White's king on e1 appears to be uncastled and potentially vulnerable. My queen has many options, and I should look for the most forcing moves.

The move **d8d1+** looks very promising - this would be a check that forces White's king to move, and it's a powerful centralization of my queen that also attacks along the back rank.

Let me verify this is in my legal moves list... I see d8d3, d8d4, d8d5, d8d6, d8d7 but I don't see d8d1. Let me reconsider.

Looking more carefully at the position and my available moves, **d8h4** stands out as a strong aggressive move, putting pressure on White's kingside and potentially creating mating threats.

Looking at this position, I can see that White's king is on e1 and appears to be in a somewhat exposed position. I notice I have a powerful queen on h4 and several pieces that could potentially create threats.

Let me analyze the key features:
- My queen on h4 is very active
- White's king on e1 looks vulnerable
- I have knights on c6 and d2 that could contribute to an attack
- My rook on f8 could potentially join an attack

The knight on d2 is particularly well-placed and can move to several strong squares. Let me look for the most forcing move.

I see that my knight on d2 can move to f3, which would give check to the White king on e1. This looks like a strong, forcing move that will put immediate pressure on White.

Looking at this position, I can see several interesting tactical possibilities. Let me analyze the key features:

1. My queen on h4 is very actively placed
2. White's king on f2 looks somewhat exposed
3. I have a knight on f3 that's well-placed
4. My rook on f8 and bishop on c8 can potentially create threats

I notice that my queen on h4 has several strong options. Let me look for the most forcing move.

The move h4g3+ looks very promising - it would be a check that forces the white king to move, and it attacks the g3 square next to the exposed king. This could lead to a strong attack.

Looking at this position, I can see that White has developed pieces but the position is still in the middlegame phase. I notice a few key features:

1. My king is on h8 and appears somewhat exposed
2. I have a rook on f8 that could be more active
3. I have knights on c6 and f3, with the f3 knight being particularly well-placed
4. White's king is on f1, which seems somewhat unsafe

Let me look for the most forcing and effective move. The knight on f3 is in an excellent position and can create threats. I notice that from f3, my knight can go to several strong squares.

The move that stands out to me is **f3e1+**, which would be a knight fork, giving check to the White king on f1 and potentially winning material.

Looking at the board position, I can see:

- My king is on h8
- I have a rook on f8
- I have a bishop on c8
- I have a knight on c6
- I have another knight on e1 (which seems to be deep in White's territory)
- White's king appears to be on f1

This looks like an endgame position. My knight on e1 is very well placed, and I should look for tactical opportunities.

Let me analyze the key candidate moves:

1. The knight on e1 has several good squares: f3, d3, g2, c2
2. My rook on f8 can move along the back rank
3. My other pieces have various options

The knight on e1 is in a fantastic position. Moving it to f3 would give check to the White king on f1, which could be very strong. Let me make this move:

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Looking at the position, I can see that Black has:
- King on h8
- Rook on f8
- Bishop on c8
- Knights on c6 and f3
- Pawns on a7, b7, c7, f7, g7, h7

White has:
- King on f1
- Rook on a2 and g1
- Bishops on e2 and c1
- Knight on b6 and h6
- Pawns on a5, c4, d3, f4, b3, h3

I notice that my knight on f3 is very well-placed and can create threats. Let me look for the most forcing move. The knight on f3 can go to several squares, and I see that f3e1 would be a fork, attacking both the king on f1 and potentially other pieces.

Looking at the position, I can see that White has their king on f1 and appears to be in a somewhat exposed position. I have a knight on e1 that's very well-placed deep in White's territory, and I should look for tactical opportunities.

Let me analyze the key features:
- My knight on e1 is excellently placed
- White's king on f1 looks vulnerable
- I have a rook on f8 and bishop on c8 that could potentially create threats

The knight move e1f3 looks very interesting as it would give check to the White king on f1, forcing the king to move and potentially creating further tactical opportunities.

2. I have a rook on f8, bishop on c8, and knights on c6 and e1
3. White has bishops on f2 and c1, rooks on a3 and g3, and the king on f1
4. White has advanced pawns that could be creating threats

Looking at the available moves, I notice I have several interesting tactical options. Let me examine the knight on e1, which is in an advanced position and could create threats.

The move e1f3+ looks very promising as it would give check to the white king on f1, forcing it to move and potentially disrupting White's coordination.

The knight on f3 can give check with Ng1+ or Ne1+, but I see an even better option - my knight can capture something or create threats.

Actually, looking more carefully, I see that Ne1+ would be a fork, checking the white king on f1 and potentially attacking other pieces.

Looking at this position, I can see that White has a rook on g3 that appears to be quite active. I notice I have a knight on c6 that can make some strong moves, and my rook on f8 has some mobility along the back rank.

Let me analyze the key features:
- My king on h8 looks somewhat exposed
- White's rook on g3 is actively placed
- I have a knight on c6 with good central squares available
- My bishop on c8 can develop

I think centralizing my knight would be a good strategic move. The knight can go to e5 or d4, both strong central squares. Let me play:

make_move c6e5

This move:
1. Centralizes my knight on a strong outpost
2. Attacks White's bishop on c4 (if there is one - I see a pawn on c4)
3. Controls important central squares
4. Improves my piece coordination

Looking at this position, I can see that White has a rook on e4 that appears to be quite active. I also notice that my king on h8 is somewhat exposed. Let me analyze the key features:

1. White has rooks on a2 and e4, with the e4 rook being particularly active
2. My king is on h8 and could use better safety
3. I have knights on e5 and e1 that are well-placed
4. My rook on f8 has some mobility along the back rank

Given the position, I think moving my king to safety should be a priority. The move Kg8 would improve my king's position and potentially prepare for better coordination.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Looking at this position, I can see that White has a rook on e4 that's quite active, and I need to be careful about my king safety on g8. Let me analyze the key features:

1. My king is on g8 with limited mobility
2. White has a rook on e4 and another on a3
3. I have knights on e5 and e1 that are well-placed
4. My bishop on c8 needs better coordination

I'm considering several candidate moves:

1. **e5d7** - Centralizes the knight and prepares to coordinate better
2. **e5g6** - Attacks the h-file and improves king safety
3. **c8d7** - Develops the bishop to a more active square
4. **e1f3** - Centralizes the other knight

I think the most principled move is to improve my piece coordination. The knight on e5 is well-placed, but moving it to d7 would help coordinate my pieces better and prepare potential counterplay.

Looking at the position, I can see that White has a rook on e4 and my king is on g8. I notice that White's king is on f1 and appears to be in a somewhat exposed position. My knight on e1 is very actively placed and can create threats.

Let me analyze some key candidate moves:

1. **e1f3** - This centralizes my knight and attacks important squares
2. **e1d3** - Also centralizes the knight with good control
3. **e1g2** - Attacks the white king area but might be less effective
4. **f8e8** or **f8d8** - Rook moves that could improve my rook's activity

The knight on e1 is perfectly placed to create maximum disruption. Moving it to f3 would:
- Centralize the knight on an excellent square
- Control key central squares
- Potentially support future tactical ideas
- Keep pressure on White's position

Looking at the position, I can see that White has a knight on f3 that's quite active, and my king on g8 looks somewhat exposed. Let me analyze the key features:

- My king is on g8 with limited mobility
- White has a knight on f3 that can potentially create threats
- I have a knight on f3 (wait, that seems to be White's knight based on the legal moves)
- My rook is on f8

Looking at the legal moves, I notice that my knight (which must be the black knight) can move to various squares. The moves starting with "f3" suggest I have a knight on f3.

Let me make a move that improves my position. I'll move my knight from f3 to e5, which centralizes it and potentially eyes some good squares.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Looking at the position, I can see that:

1. My king is on g8 and appears to be in a somewhat exposed position
2. I have a knight on e5 which is well-centralized
3. White has a knight on d4 and bishops that could be creating threats
4. My rook is on f8

Let me analyze the key candidate moves:

- **e5d7**: Retreats the knight but to a less active square
- **e5g6**: Moves the knight to attack potential targets and stay active
- **e5c6**: Centralizes the knight on a good outpost
- **e5f3**: Advances the knight aggressively, potentially forking or creating threats
- **f8e8** or **f8d8**: Rook moves to potentially better squares

The knight on e5 is my most active piece, so I want to keep it well-placed. The move **e5c6** looks appealing as it maintains the knight on a strong central outpost while potentially eyeing important squares.

However, **e5f3** is very interesting as it advances the knight aggressively and could be creating tactical threats against White's position.

Let me go with the aggressive knight advance:

- I have a knight on f3 which is well-placed in White's territory
- White's king is on g2, and they have rooks on a2 and h3
- White has a bishop on b2 and another on e2

The knight on f3 is in an excellent attacking position. I notice I can give check with the knight, which could be very strong in this position.

make_move f3e1

This move puts the knight on e1, giving check to the White king on g2 and potentially creating tactical opportunities. The knight will be attacking from a strong central square and forcing White's king to move.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Looking at the position, I can see this is an endgame with:
- Black: King on g8, Rook on f8, Bishop on c8, and several pawns
- White: King on g1, Rooks on a2 and f3, Bishop on b2, Knight on d4, and pawns

The white knight on d4 is very centralized and strong. I should look to improve my piece coordination. Let me analyze the key candidate moves:

1. **f8e8** - Centralizes the rook on the e-file
2. **c8d7** - Develops the bishop to a more active square
3. **g8h8** - King safety move, but passive

I think centralizing my rook with **f8e8** is the most principled move. This:
- Places the rook on the central e-file
- Potentially prepares to challenge White's pieces
- Keeps the king relatively safe on g8
- Maintains flexibility for future plans

Let me analyze this position. I can see that:

1. My king is on g8 and can move to various squares
2. My rook is on e8 with many movement options along the e-file
3. My bishop is on c8 
4. My knight is on e1, which is deep in White's territory
5. I have several pawn moves available

The knight on e1 is in a very advanced position. Let me look for the most effective move. The knight can go to f3, d3, g2, or c2. 

Moving to f3 would give check to the White king on g1, which seems like a strong tactical option.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Looking at the position, I can see that White has a knight on d4 (8th rank from my perspective) that's quite centrally placed and potentially dangerous. I also notice that my rook on e8 has good mobility along the e-file and rank.

Let me analyze some key candidate moves:

1. My knight on f3 can move to several squares, including some tactical possibilities
2. My rook on e8 has many options along the e-file
3. I should look for ways to improve my piece coordination

The knight move f3e5 looks particularly interesting as it:
- Centralizes my knight to a strong outpost
- Attacks the white knight on d4 (if I'm reading the position correctly)
- Controls important central squares

Let me make this move:

Looking at the position, I can see that:

1. My king is on g8 and appears to be somewhat exposed
2. I have a rook on e8 and a bishop on c8
3. White has pieces that could potentially create threats

Let me analyze the key candidate moves:

- **e8e5**: This centralizes my rook, putting it on an active square where it can control important central files and ranks
- **c8d7** or **c8e6**: These develop my bishop to more active squares
- King moves like **g8h8** or **g8f8**: These might improve king safety
- Pawn moves: Various pawn advances are available but seem less urgent

The rook move to e5 stands out as it:
- Centralizes my most powerful piece
- Controls the 5th rank
- Potentially supports future tactical operations
- Gets the rook to a more active position

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Looking at the position, I can see that:

1. My king is on g8 and can move to h8 or f8
2. I have a bishop on c8 that can move to several squares (d7, e6, f5)
3. I have several pawn moves available

Let me analyze the position more carefully. I notice that White has a rook on f3 and bishops on e5 and e2. My king looks somewhat exposed on g8.

The most natural developing move would be to develop my bishop from c8. Looking at the options:
- Bc8-d7 keeps the bishop closer to defend
- Bc8-e6 centralizes the bishop
- Bc8-f5 is more aggressive

Given that my king position looks a bit precarious and White has active pieces, I think the solid developing move Bd7 would be best, keeping my pieces coordinated and preparing to potentially castle queenside if needed.

2. I have a bishop on d7 that has good mobility
3. White has bishops on e5 and g4, and a rook on h3, suggesting an attacking setup
4. White also has a rook on a2

This looks like a tactical position where White may be threatening something. Let me analyze the key candidate moves:

- King moves (g8h8, g8f8) for safety
- Bishop moves from d7 to various squares
- Pawn advances

Given White's piece placement with bishops and a rook that could be part of an attack, I should prioritize king safety. Moving the king to h8 gets it to the corner and away from potential tactics along the f8-a3 diagonal and the g-file.

I can see I only have two legal moves with my king: Kg8 or Kg7. Let me analyze the position more carefully:

Looking at the board, I notice that White has a bishop on g7 which is quite active, and my king on h8 is somewhat restricted. The position appears to be a difficult endgame for Black.

Between the two moves:
- Kg8 would move my king toward the center of the back rank
- Kg7 would challenge the White bishop directly

Given that the White bishop on g7 is controlling important squares and my king is currently trapped on h8, I think the more active move is to challenge that bishop.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Now I can see my available moves. Let me analyze the position more carefully:

My pieces:
- King on g7 (can move to h8, g8, f8, h6, f6)
- Bishop on d7 (can move to e8, c8, e6, c6, f5, b5, a4)
- Pawns on a7, b7, c7, f7, h7

This looks like an endgame where I need to be careful about king safety and piece coordination. The white rooks on a2 and h2 suggest they might be trying to create threats on the second rank or against my king.

Let me consider my options:

1. King moves: Moving to h8 or g8 might put my king in a corner, which could be dangerous. f8, h6, or f6 keep more options open.

2. Bishop moves: The bishop on d7 is centrally placed. Moving it to e6 or c6 maintains good central control, while f5 could be active.

3. Pawn moves: Advancing pawns could create counterplay.

Given that this appears to be an endgame with rooks vs bishop, I should try to keep my pieces active and coordinated. I think advancing my bishop to a more active square would be good.

I can see the current position. My black king is on g7, and I have several pawns. White has a king on f1, a rook on h3, a bishop on f3, and several pawns. Let me check what legal moves are available to me.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Looking at this position, I can see that my king on g7 is somewhat exposed and White has active pieces. Let me analyze the key features:

- My king has several escape squares
- White has a rook on h3 and bishop on f3 that could be threatening
- I have pawns that can advance or provide support

Given that my king appears to be in a somewhat precarious position, I should prioritize king safety. Moving the king to a safer square seems prudent.

The move Kg8 would put my king on the back rank where it's typically safer, and it gets away from potential threats while maintaining flexibility.

I can see this is an endgame position where I (Black) have a King and Rook, while White has a King, Rook, and Bishop. My king is on g8 and my rook is on a2. Let me check what legal moves are available to me.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

I notice there's a discrepancy between what I see on the board and the legal moves provided. The moves suggest I have pawns on a7, b7, c7, f7, and h7, but looking at the board display, I see black pawns on a7, b7, c7, f7, and h7 in the 7th rank (2nd rank from Black's perspective).

Let me reassess: I have a king on g8, pawns on a7, b7, c7, f7, h7, and what appears to be a rook on a2.

Given this endgame position with my material disadvantage (King + Rook + pawns vs King + Rook + Bishop + pawns), I should look for active play. The move g8h8 or g8f8 would move my king, but pawn advances might be more productive.

I'll advance the f-pawn to create some activity and potential threats:

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Looking at this endgame position, I need to assess the key features:

1. Material is roughly equal (White has 2 rooks + bishop vs Black's extra pawns)
2. White has an advanced passed pawn on e6 which is very dangerous
3. My king is somewhat trapped on the back rank
4. White's king is actively placed on g3

The most critical threat is White's e6 pawn, which is only two squares away from promoting. I need to either:
- Try to blockade or attack this pawn
- Create counterplay with my own pawns
- Improve my king position

Looking at my options, I think the most active move is to advance my f-pawn to create counterplay and potentially threaten White's king position.

- White rook on a2 and h3

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Looking at this endgame position, I need to assess the key factors:

1. Material: White has two rooks and a bishop vs my king and pawns - White has a significant material advantage
2. King safety: My king on g8 is somewhat restricted
3. Pawn structure: I have a passed pawn on f4 which could be valuable
4. White's pieces are actively placed

Let me analyze the key candidate moves:

- **g8f8** or **g8h8**: Lateral king moves that don't improve my position much
- **g8g7**: Activates my king toward the center and supports potential pawn advances
- **h7h6** or **h7h5**: Pawn moves on the kingside
- **c7c6, c7c5**: Advancing the c-pawn
- **b7b6, b7b5**: Advancing the b-pawn  
- **a7a6**: Advancing the a-pawn

In this difficult position, I think the most principled approach is to activate my king and try to support my pawns. The move **g8g7** centralizes my king and prepares to potentially support pawn advances or create counterplay.

- Several pawns on a7, b7, c7, h7, and f4
- White has a king on h2, rooks on a3 and h3, a bishop on h5, and several pawns

This looks like a complex endgame. Let me check what legal moves are available to me.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Looking at this position, I can see that White has active pieces with rooks on a3 and h3, and a bishop on h5. My king is somewhat restricted on g7, and I have a passed pawn on f4 that could be valuable.

Let me analyze the key candidate moves:

1. **f4f3** - Advancing my passed pawn closer to promotion
2. **g7f6** - Activating my king and potentially supporting the f-pawn
3. **g7h6** - Attacking the bishop on h5
4. Pawn advances on the queenside (a6, b6, c6, etc.)

The f4 pawn is my most advanced and dangerous asset. Pushing it to f3 puts immediate pressure on White and brings it closer to queening. This forces White to deal with the threat.

**White pieces:**

- Rook on h2
- Bishop on f2
- Pawns on a4, c3, d2, e5, h3

**Black pieces:**
- King on g6
- Pawns on a7, b7, c7, h7

This appears to be a difficult endgame for Black, as White has significantly more material. Let me check what legal moves are available to me.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

I notice there's an error in the legal moves list - it shows the king on g7, but the board shows it on g6. Based on the board position showing my king on g6, let me work with the actual position.

Looking at this endgame, I'm significantly behind in material (White has two rooks and a bishop vs my pawns), so I need to try to create counterplay or find the most resilient defense.

The key considerations are:
1. Keep my king active and centralized
2. Try to advance my pawns to create threats
3. Avoid allowing White's pieces to coordinate too easily

Given that my king appears to be on g6 (not g7 as the move list suggests), and considering the position, I think advancing the c-pawn to create some counterplay on the queenside would be a good practical try.

I can see this is an endgame position. Let me analyze what I have:

- Black King on g7
- Black Rook on a4
- Black pawns on a7, b7, c5, h7

White has:
- White King on h3
- White Rook on h4
- White Bishop on f4
- White pawns on a6, b5, c4, d4, h5

This looks like a complex rook and minor piece endgame. Let me check my legal moves to see what options I have.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Looking at this position, I can see that White has advanced pawns and my king is somewhat restricted. Let me analyze the key candidate moves:

1. King moves: g7h8, g7g8, g7f8, g7h6, g7g6, g7f6
2. Pawn moves: c5b4 (capturing something), h7h6, h7h5, b7b6, b7b5, a7a6

The move c5b4 appears to be a capture, which could be significant. However, I notice White has a rook on h4 and my king is on g7, which could be creating some tactical threats.

Looking at h7h6, this move attacks White's advanced h5 pawn and could help create counterplay on the kingside. This seems like a natural and strong move because:

1. It attacks the h5 pawn
2. It opens up escape squares for my king
3. It creates potential pawn breaks on the kingside

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Looking at this position, I need to assess the key factors:

1. Material is roughly equal (rook + 4 pawns vs bishop + 6 pawns)
2. White has a dangerous passed pawn on e6
3. My rook on h3 is actively placed
4. White's king and bishop are somewhat coordinated

Let me consider my main candidate moves:

1. **c5xd4** - Captures a central pawn and creates a passed pawn
2. **c5xb4** - Captures a pawn and opens lines
3. **h6h5** - Attacks White's h4 pawn
4. King moves to improve position

The pawn captures look most promising. Between cxd4 and cxb4, taking on d4 seems stronger because:
- It eliminates White's central pawn mass
- Creates a dangerous passed d-pawn for me
- Opens up the position for my rook

g7h8,g7f8,g7h7,g7f6

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

I can see this is an endgame position where I have a black king on g7 and a black pawn on h6, while White has a king on g2, rook on g3, bishop on f3, and several pawns.

Looking at my legal moves:
- g7h8: King to h8
- g7f8: King to f8  
- g7h7: King to h7
- g7f6: King to f6

This appears to be a difficult endgame position for Black. The white rook and bishop are actively placed, and I need to be careful about king safety. 

Moving to f6 would be walking into potential danger from the white pieces. Moving to h8 or h7 keeps my king near my pawn but might lead to back-rank issues. Moving to f8 gives me more central control while staying relatively safe.

I think the most principled move is to keep my king active while avoiding immediate tactical threats.

- I have pawns on a7, b7, h6, and d4
- White has a rook on g3 and f3, a bishop on f3, king on g2, and several pawns
- This appears to be an endgame position

Let me analyze the key candidate moves:

1. **d4d3** - This advances my passed pawn, which could be very dangerous as it's only two squares from promotion
2. **f8e8** or **f8e7** - King moves to improve position
3. Pawn moves on the queenside or h6h5

The most forcing and potentially winning move appears to be advancing my passed d-pawn. In endgames, passed pawns must be pushed, especially when they're so close to promotion.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

I can see this is an endgame position where I have a king on f8, pawns on a7, b7, h6, and d2, while White has a king on g1, rooks on b2 and h3, a bishop on f3, and pawns on a5, b4, c4, e6, and h4.

The most critical move here is promoting my pawn on d2. Let me analyze the promotion options:

- d2d1q (promote to queen) - This gives me the most powerful piece
- d2d1r (promote to rook) - Strong but less versatile than a queen
- d2d1b (promote to bishop) - Limited by the bishop's diagonal movement
- d2d1n (promote to knight) - Could be useful for tactics but generally weaker

Given that I'm in an endgame where material advantage is crucial, and a queen is the most powerful piece that can help me create threats against White's king and coordinate with my other pieces, I'll promote to a queen.

Looking at this endgame position, I can see:

- Black king on f8
- Black pawns on a7, b7, and h6
- White king on g1
- White rook on h3
- White rook on b2
- White bishop on d1
- White pawns on a5, b4, c4, e6, and h4

This appears to be a difficult endgame for black. The white pawns are quite advanced, particularly the e6 pawn which is very dangerous. I need to be careful about king safety while trying to create counterplay with my pawns.

Let me advance my b-pawn to create some activity on the queenside and potentially distract white from the kingside attack.

I can see this is an endgame position. Let me analyze what's on the board:

**White pieces:**
- King on g1
- Rook on h1
- Rook on b2
- Bishop on d1
- Pawns on a5, b4, c4, e6, h4

**Black pieces:**
- King on f8
- Pawns on a7, b5, h6

This appears to be a difficult endgame for Black, as White has significantly more material. Let me check what legal moves are available to me.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Looking at this position, I'm in a very difficult endgame with limited material. White has a significant advantage with two rooks and a bishop plus pawns, while I only have my king and two pawns.

Let me analyze my options:

1. **King moves**: f8g8, f8e8, f8g7, f8e7 - These are defensive moves to keep my king active
2. **Pawn moves**: 
   - b5xc4 - Captures White's pawn, which is good material-wise
   - a7a6 - Advances my a-pawn
   - h6h5 - Advances my h-pawn, potentially creating counterplay

Given the position, capturing the white pawn on c4 seems like the best practical choice. It eliminates one of White's pawns and gives me some material back, even though the position remains very difficult.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

I can see this is an endgame position where I have a king on f8, a pawn on a7, and a pawn on c2 that's about to promote. White has a king on f2, a rook on e2, a rook on h1, and a bishop on d1, plus some pawns.

The most critical decision is what to promote my c2 pawn to. Let me analyze the options:

1. Promoting to a queen (c2c1q or c2d1q) gives the most powerful piece
2. The c2d1q option captures White's bishop, which is very attractive
3. King moves with f8 don't seem immediately urgent

Capturing the bishop while promoting to a queen eliminates a key White piece and gives me the strongest possible piece. This should significantly improve my position.

Let me analyze the key candidate moves:
1. **d1e1+** - This captures the White rook on e1 with check, which would be a significant material gain
2. **d1e2+** - This gives check and attacks the king directly
3. **d1f3+** - Another checking move that brings the queen closer to the White king

The move **d1e1+** stands out as it wins material (a full rook) while giving check. This would put White in a very difficult position as they'd be down significant material in the endgame.

With my queen so actively placed on e3, I have many tactical possibilities. Let me look for the most forcing move.

I notice that my queen on e3 can deliver checkmate! The white king on g2 would be attacked by my queen moving to g1, and with the white king's escape squares limited, this appears to be mate.

I can see this is an endgame position with very few pieces remaining. Let me analyze what's on the board:

- Black King on f8
- Black pawns on a7 and h5
- White King on g1
- White Rook on h1
- White pawns on a6, e5, b4, and h4

This appears to be a King and Rook vs King and pawns endgame. Let me check what legal moves are available to me.

f8g8,f8e8,f8g7,f8e7,h6h5

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

I notice there's a discrepancy - the board shows a black pawn on h5, but the legal moves include h6h5, suggesting there's actually a black pawn on h6 that I can move to h5.

Looking at this position, I need to be very careful as White has a rook which is a powerful piece in the endgame. My main assets are my two pawns, and I need to try to advance them while keeping my king safe.

The move h6h5 would advance my h-pawn and potentially create threats on the kingside. However, I should also consider king moves to improve my position.

Let me analyze:
- f8g8, f8e8: Lateral king moves along the back rank
- f8g7, f8e7: King moves forward, potentially more active
- h6h5: Pawn advance

Given that this is a rook endgame, I want to keep my king active and advance my pawns when safe. The move f8e7 looks good as it centralizes my king and prepares to support my pawns.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

I see my legal moves. Looking at the position more carefully, I notice I have a pawn on h6 (not h5 as I initially thought). 

Let me analyze the key features of this position:
- My king is on e7
- I have pawns on a7 and h6
- White has a rook on h1, king on f1, and pawns on a6, e6, b4, h4

The critical decision is whether to advance my h-pawn or focus on king activity. The move h6h5 creates a passed pawn and puts pressure on White's h4 pawn, potentially creating counterplay on the kingside while White's rook and king are somewhat uncoordinated.

Alternatively, I could try to improve my king position, but with White's rook controlling key squares and the advanced e6 pawn limiting my king's mobility, creating immediate counterplay with the h-pawn seems most promising.

I can see my king has 6 possible moves. Looking at this position, I need to be very careful as White has a rook and several pawns, while I only have a king and two pawns.

Let me analyze the key factors:
1. White's e6 pawn is very advanced and dangerous
2. My h4 pawn could potentially become dangerous if I can support it
3. I need to avoid getting mated by the rook
4. The move e7e6 would capture White's advanced pawn, which seems very attractive

The e6 pawn is White's most dangerous asset in this position, and capturing it would eliminate a major threat while also improving my king's position.

This appears to be a King and Rook vs King and pawn endgame. My black pawn on h4 is quite advanced and could become dangerous if I can support it properly.

Looking at my options, I need to consider:
1. Supporting my h-pawn's advance
2. Keeping my king active
3. Avoiding getting cut off by the white rook

The move e6f5 looks promising as it:
- Keeps my king active and centralized
- Moves closer to support my h-pawn
- Maintains good king activity for the endgame

I can see this is an endgame position with very few pieces remaining:
- White: King on f3, Rook on e1, and pawns on a6, b4, h4
- Black: King on f5 and pawn on h5

I have two legal moves: f5g6 (king to g6) or f5f6 (king to f6).

Looking at this position, I need to be careful about the White rook on e1 and the advancing pawns. The move f5g6 would put my king closer to the h-file where my pawn is, potentially supporting its advance. The move f5f6 keeps the king more centralized.

Given that I have a passed h-pawn, I should try to support its advance while keeping my king active. Moving to g6 would support the h5 pawn and potentially create threats.

- I have pawns on a7 and h5
- White has pawns on a6, b5, and h5 (wait, that can't be right - there can't be pawns from both sides on h5)

Let me reconsider the position. I see my king has several options. The key in rook endgames is usually to:
1. Keep my king active
2. Support my passed pawns
3. Avoid getting cut off by the rook

Looking at my options:
- g6h7, g6f7, g6h6, g6f6, g6f5

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Looking at this position, I can see it's a critical rook and pawn endgame. My king is actively placed on f5, and I have pawns on a7 and h5. White has a rook on a1, king on f3, and pawns on a6, b4, and h4.

Let me analyze my options:

1. **f5g6** - Moves toward the h-pawn, potentially supporting my h5 pawn's advance
2. **f5f6** - Advances up the f-file, centralizing the king
3. **f5e6** - Moves toward the center/queenside
4. **f5e5** - Moves toward the center, potentially opposing White's king

In rook endgames, king activity is crucial. The move f5f6 looks most promising as it:
- Advances my king actively up the board
- Keeps my king centralized
- Potentially supports future pawn advances
- Maintains good coordination with my pawns

I can see this is an endgame position with very few pieces remaining. Let me analyze what's on the board:

- Black king on f6
- Black pawns on a7 and h5
- White king on f3
- White rook on a4
- White pawns on a6, b4, and h4

This appears to be a rook and pawns endgame. Let me check what legal moves are available to me as Black.

I can see my king has several options. Let me analyze this position:

- White has a rook on a4 and pawns on a6, b4, and h4
- I have pawns on a7 and h5
- My king is currently on f6

This looks like a critical endgame position. The white pawn on a6 is very advanced and threatening to promote, while my a7 pawn is blockaded. On the kingside, there's a pawn race with h-pawns.

Looking at the position, I need to be very careful about king placement. The white king on f3 seems to be supporting the h4 pawn advance, and I need to consider whether to challenge it or deal with other threats.

Let me move my king to g6 to:
1. Support my h5 pawn
2. Potentially challenge White's kingside pawn majority
3. Keep my king active and centralized

Looking at this position, I can see:

- White has a rook on a1 and pawns on a6, b4, h4
- Black (me) has a king on g6 and pawns on a7, h5
- White's a-pawn is quite advanced and could become dangerous

My king moves are: g6h7, g6g7, g6f7, g6h6, g6f6, g6f5

I need to be careful about White's rook activity and the advanced a-pawn. The key considerations are:
1. White's a6 pawn is very advanced and needs attention
2. My h5 pawn is blocked by White's h4 pawn
3. I should try to activate my king while being mindful of rook checks

Looking at the position, I think moving my king toward the center and White's pawns would be most active. The move Kf5 (g6f5) looks promising as it:
- Centralizes my king
- Moves toward White's pawns
- Keeps options open for supporting my own pawns or attacking White's

This appears to be a rook and pawn endgame. Let me check what legal moves are available to me.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Looking at this position, I can see that White has a dangerous passed pawn on a6 that's very close to promoting. My king is currently on f5 and I need to make a decision about whether to try to stop that pawn or improve my king position.

Let me analyze the key factors:
1. White's a-pawn is on a6, just two squares from promotion
2. My a-pawn is still on a7, blocking immediate promotion but also blocking my own pawn
3. White's rook on a1 is supporting the advance
4. I have pawns on a7 and h5, White has pawns on a6, b4, and h4

The critical decision is whether I can stop White's a-pawn. If I move my king toward the queenside (f5e6, f5e5, f5e4), I might be able to help deal with White's pawn advance. However, moving toward the kingside (f5g6, f5f6) could help support my h-pawn.

Given that White's a-pawn is so advanced and dangerous, I think I need to move my king toward the center/queenside to have any chance of creating counterplay or stopping White's threats.

I notice there's a discrepancy between the board display and the legal moves. The legal moves suggest my king is on e5, but the board shows it on e4. I'll trust the legal moves system as it's more likely to be accurate for game mechanics.

Looking at the position and available king moves, I need to consider:
1. The position of the white king on h1
2. My rook on a1 which gives me good attacking chances
3. The pawn structure

Since this appears to be a rook endgame where I have an active rook and the white king looks poorly placed on h1, I should look to improve my king position while maintaining pressure.

The move e5f4 looks promising as it:
- Advances my king toward the center/white's position
- Keeps my king active and centralized
- Maintains coordination with my rook

I can see that my legal moves are all king moves: f4f5, f4e5, f4g4, f4e4, f4f3, f4e3.

Looking at this position, I have a significant material advantage with my rook, but I need to be careful about the pawn endgame aspects. Let me analyze the key considerations:

1. White has advanced pawns on the queenside (a6, b5) that could become dangerous
2. On the kingside, there's a pawn race situation with my h5 pawn vs White's h4 pawn
3. My rook on a1 is well-placed to deal with White's queenside pawns
4. I need to coordinate my king and rook effectively

The most logical plan is to advance my king to support my h-pawn's promotion while keeping an eye on White's queenside threats. Moving the king to f5 advances it up the board and supports the h-pawn's advance.

I can see my king on e5 has several options. Let me analyze the position:

- White has a rook on c4 and pawns on a6, b5, and h4
- My pawns are on a7 and h5
- The white king is far away on h2

In this endgame, I need to be careful about the white rook's activity. The rook is currently on c4, likely supporting the advanced pawns on the queenside. 

Looking at my options:
- e5f6, e5e6, e5d6 move toward the center/kingside
- e5f5, e5d5 move along the 5th rank

I think the best move is to advance my king toward the center and potentially support my pawns or create counterplay. Moving to f6 would centralize my king and potentially prepare to support my h-pawn or create threats.

- Black king on f6
- Black pawns on a7 and h5
- White king on h3
- White rook on b4
- White pawns on a6, b5, and h4

This appears to be a rook and pawn endgame. Let me check what legal moves are available to me.

I can see my king has several options. Let me analyze the position:

- White has a rook on b4 and pawns on a6, b5, h4
- I have pawns on a7 and h5
- My king is currently on f6

Looking at the position, I need to be careful about the white rook's activity and the pawn structure. The white pawn on a6 is attacking my a7 pawn, and there's a passed b5 pawn to consider.

My king should try to:
1. Support my pawns
2. Stop White's passed pawns
3. Avoid getting cut off by the rook

The h-file pawn race looks important - I have h5 vs White's h4. Moving my king toward the kingside to support the h-pawn advance could be key.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Looking at this position, I can see that White has a rook and pawns while I have just pawns. This is a difficult endgame for Black. Let me analyze the key factors:

1. White has an advanced passed pawn on a6, threatening to promote
2. My king is somewhat active on g6
3. I have pawns on a7 and h5 that could potentially create counterplay
4. The white king on h2 is relatively passive

My main strategic goals should be:
- Keep my king active and centralized
- Try to create counterplay with my pawns
- Prevent White from easily coordinating their pieces

Looking at my options:
- g6h7, g6g7: These moves put my king on the back rank, which seems passive
- g6f7, g6f6, g6f5: These moves centralize my king and keep it active
- g6h6: This supports my h5 pawn but might be less active

I think centralizing my king is the best approach. Moving to f6 keeps my king active and maintains flexibility for both supporting my pawns and opposing White's plans.

- Black pawns (♟) on a7 and h5
- White King (♔) on g2
- White Rook (♖) on b2
- White pawns (♙) on a6, b5, and h4

This appears to be a rook and pawn endgame. Let me check what legal moves are available to me as Black.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

I can see my king on f6 has several options. Let me analyze this position:

- White has a rook on b2 and pawns on a6, b5, h4
- I have pawns on a7 and h5
- White's a6 pawn is quite advanced and threatening
- My h5 pawn is blocked by White's h4 pawn

The key strategic considerations:
1. White's a-pawn is very dangerous and close to promoting
2. I need to either create counterplay with my king or try to stop White's pawn advance
3. My king is relatively active in the center

Looking at the position, I think I should move my king toward the queenside to help deal with White's dangerous passed pawn. The move Ke6 or Ke7 would centralize my king and potentially help coordinate with my a7 pawn.

However, Kg6 might also be interesting to support my h-pawn and create some kingside counterplay.

I'll go with Ke6 to centralize my king and prepare to deal with White's queenside threats.

I can see the available king moves. Let me analyze this position:

- White has a rook on e2 which is quite active
- My king is centralized on e6
- White has advanced pawns on the queenside (a6, b5) 
- There's a pawn race situation on the kingside with my h5 pawn vs White's h4 pawn
- My a7 pawn is being attacked by White's advanced a6 pawn

In rook endgames, king activity is crucial. I need to consider:
1. Supporting my passed h-pawn
2. Dealing with White's queenside pressure
3. Keeping my king active

Looking at the position, I think moving my king toward the kingside to support my h-pawn advance could be the right strategy, as it's closer to promoting than dealing with the queenside where White has more advanced pawns.

- f5g4: King moves to g4
- f5f4: King moves to f4

The obvious best move here is to capture the white rook with my king, which will give me a significant material advantage.

1. On the kingside, there's a pawn race with my h5 pawn vs White's h4 pawn
2. On the queenside, White has advanced pawns on a6 and b5, with my a7 pawn under pressure
3. The white king on g3 is closer to the kingside pawns

In this type of endgame, king activity and pawn races are crucial. I need to either:
- Support my h-pawn's advance to promotion
- Try to stop White's queenside pawns
- Create counterplay

Given that the white king is already close to the kingside, I should focus on the h-pawn race. Moving my king toward the h-pawn to support its advance seems most logical.

- King moves like `f5g6` could support my h-pawn's advance
- `f5e4` or `f5e5` would centralize my king

The key insight is that I need to create counterplay. With my king on f5, I should advance it to support my h-pawn while the White king is somewhat out of play on g3.

`f5g6` looks very strong because:
1. It supports my h5 pawn's advance to h4, creating immediate threats
2. It puts pressure on White's kingside
3. It forces White to deal with my advancing h-pawn

I can see this is an endgame position with very few pieces remaining. Let me analyze what's on the board:

- Black king on g6
- Black pawns on a7 and h5
- White king on h3
- White pawns on a6 and b6

This appears to be a king and pawn endgame. Let me check what legal moves are available to me as Black.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Looking at this position, I can see that White has advanced pawns on a6 and b6, and my a7 pawn can capture the b6 pawn. This is a critical decision in this king and pawn endgame.

Let me analyze the key options:

1. **a7xb6** - Capture the white pawn, creating a passed pawn
2. King moves (g6h7, g6g7, g6f7, etc.) - Repositioning my king

In king and pawn endgames, creating a passed pawn is usually very strong, especially when it's far from the opponent's king. The white king on h3 is quite far from the queenside action.

If I play axb6, I'll have a dangerous passed b-pawn that the white king will struggle to catch. Meanwhile, my king can support the pawn's advance or deal with White's h-side pawn.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Looking at this endgame position, I need to analyze the pawn structure and king activity carefully. I have several options:

King moves: g6h7, g6g7, g6f7, g6h6, g6f6, g6f5
Pawn move: b6b5

This appears to be a critical endgame where both sides have passed pawns. White has an advanced pawn on a6, while I have pawns on b6 and h5. 

The key considerations are:
1. White's a6 pawn is very advanced and dangerous
2. My b6 pawn could become a counter-threat if pushed
3. The h-file pawn race is also important
4. King activity and positioning is crucial

I think the most principled move here is to advance my b-pawn to create counter-play against White's advanced a-pawn. This creates immediate threats and forces White to calculate carefully.

Looking at this king and pawn endgame, I need to assess the position carefully:

- White has pawns on a6 and h4
- Black has pawns on b5 and h5
- My king is on g6, White's king is on g1

The key considerations are:
1. The race between the a6 and b5 pawns
2. The h-file pawn situation where I have h5 vs White's h4
3. King activity and support for pawns

White's a-pawn is quite advanced on a6, but my b-pawn can also advance. The critical factor is whether I can create counterplay or stop White's a-pawn.

My king is well-placed on g6, controlling key squares. I should advance my b-pawn to create immediate threats and force White to respond.

Given the position, I want to develop my pieces actively. The most natural and strong move here is to develop my knight to f6, which:
1. Develops a piece toward the center
2. Controls important central squares
3. Prepares to castle kingside
4. Follows classical opening principles

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

I can see this is an interesting position. Black has developed the bishop to e7 and knight to f6, while White appears to have made some early pawn moves. Let me analyze the key features:

- Black's king is still on e8 and can castle kingside (e8g8 is in the legal moves)
- The bishop on e7 is well-placed and has good mobility
- The knight on f6 is actively placed
- Black has a pawn on e5 which controls central squares

Given this position, I think castling kingside would be an excellent move to:
1. Get my king to safety
2. Connect my rooks
3. Complete a key part of my development

Player_Black (to Proxy):

I can see this is an early game position. White has played e2-e4, and I have a castled king on the kingside with my pieces still developing. Looking at the position, I notice:

1. White has advanced the e-pawn to e4
2. My bishop is actively placed on e7
3. My knight on f6 is well-positioned
4. I have several good developing options

I'll play a classical developing move that also puts pressure on White's central pawn:

make_move d7d6

This move:
- Supports my e5 pawn advance later
- Opens a diagonal for my light-squared bishop
- Maintains a solid pawn structure
- Prepares further piece development

Let me develop my pieces actively. I'll bring my knight from b8 to c6, which is a natural developing move that controls central squares and prepares for further piece development.

I can see this is a middle game position where both sides have developed their pieces. Let me analyze the key features:

- White has advanced a pawn to e4 in the center
- I have knights on c6 and f6, which are well-placed
- My bishops are on c8 and e5 (the e5 bishop is actively placed)
- White has a bishop on h3, likely targeting my kingside

Looking at my options, I want to make a move that:
1. Improves my piece activity
2. Challenges White's central control
3. Maintains good coordination

The move d6-d5 stands out as it:
- Challenges White's e4 pawn directly
- Opens up the position for my pieces
- Gains central space
- Allows my c8 bishop better scope

- Black's king is on g8

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Now I can see my available moves. Looking at the position, I notice that White has a bishop on d6 which is quite aggressively placed. I have several interesting options:

1. I could capture the bishop with `e7d6` (my bishop takes the white bishop)
2. I could advance my pawn with `d5d4` to gain space
3. I could develop my knight with moves like `f6e4` or `c6d4`

The white bishop on d6 is a strong piece that's controlling important squares and potentially threatening my position. Capturing it would eliminate a dangerous piece and win material since bishops are generally more valuable than the pawns around that area.

2. My knights on c6 and f6 are well-placed
3. My bishop on d6 is also active
4. I have a pawn majority in the center with pawns on d5 and e5
5. White's king appears to still be in the center on f1

Looking at the position, I notice that White's king hasn't castled yet and is somewhat exposed. I also see that my knight on f6 has some interesting tactical possibilities.

Let me make a move that increases pressure and improves my position:

make_move c6d4

This knight move to d4 is strong because:
- It centralizes my knight on an excellent outpost
- It attacks White's bishop on d3
- It puts pressure on White's position
- It supports my central pawn structure

Looking at this position, I can see that White has played an early e4 and I have my pieces developing nicely. I have knights on f6 and d4, with my dark-squared bishop on d6. The knight on d4 is particularly well-placed in the center.

Let me analyze some key candidate moves:

1. **Nxe2+** - This knight on d4 can capture the pawn on e2 with check, which would be very strong
2. **Nf3+** - Another check with the knight, forking king and potentially winning material
3. **Ne6** - Centralizing the knight further
4. **Castling moves** - Getting my king to safety

Wait, let me look more carefully at the position. I see that my knight on d4 can give check by moving to e2. This would be a powerful tactical shot.

I can see this is an interesting middlegame position. Let me analyze the key features:

- White has advanced a pawn to e4
- I have two knights on f6 and e2 (the e2 knight is in an advanced, active position)
- My bishop is on d6, well-placed in the center
- I have a pawn on d5 that's holding the center

The knight on e2 is particularly well-placed, giving me several tactical opportunities. Let me look for the most forcing move.

The knight on e2 can go to several squares, but Ng3 looks very appealing as it would attack White's rook on h1 and potentially create tactical threats.

- I have two knights on f6 and g3, with the g3 knight being very actively placed
- My bishop is on d6
- White's king appears to be on e1 (not castled)
- I have a pawn chain on d5-e5

The knight on g3 is in an excellent attacking position. Let me look for the most forcing moves. The knight on g3 can give check or attack key pieces.

Looking at the options, I notice that g3e2 would be a knight fork, attacking both the king on e1 and potentially other pieces. This looks like a very strong tactical shot.

2. I have two knights - one on f6 and one on e2 (which appears to be in an advanced position)
3. My bishop is on d6
4. White's king is still on e1, suggesting castling rights may still be available

The knight on e2 is in a very strong position, forking the king and potentially other pieces. Let me look for the most forcing moves.

The knight on e2 can move to several squares. Since White's king is on e1, I should look for moves that create maximum pressure.

1. My knights on f6 and e6 are well-placed
2. My bishop on d6 is actively positioned
3. White's king is still in the center
4. I have pawn breaks available with d5-d4

I think the most principled move here is to advance my central pawn and gain space while putting pressure on White's position.

This move:
- Advances in the center and gains space
- Puts pressure on White's e4 pawn
- Opens up more possibilities for my pieces
- Follows good opening principles of controlling the center

2. Centralizes my knight on an excellent outpost
3. Creates immediate tactical threats

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Looking at this position, I can see that White has developed their pieces actively with bishops on d4 and c3, and I have knights on e6 and e4. Let me analyze the key features:

1. White's king is still in the center on e1
2. I have active knights that can create threats
3. White has a strong pawn center with the pawn on d4
4. My king appears to be relatively safe on g8

I notice that my knight on e4 is very well-placed and can create some tactical opportunities. Let me look for the most forcing move.

The knight on e4 can go to several squares, but Nf2+ looks particularly attractive as it would be a fork, checking the White king on e1 and potentially attacking other pieces.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Looking at the position, I can see this is a complex middlegame position. Let me analyze the key features:

- White has a bishop on d3 and my king looks somewhat exposed
- I have knights on e6 and f2, with the f2 knight in an advanced position
- White's king is on e1, still uncastled
- I have tactical opportunities with my active pieces

The knight on f2 is in a very strong position, forking the king and potentially creating threats. Let me look for the most forcing move.

I notice that my knight on f2 can capture something or create immediate threats. The move f2e4 looks particularly interesting as it centralizes the knight and attacks multiple squares, while f2d3 would capture the white bishop.

Let me play the most forcing move:

make_move f2d3

This captures White's bishop on d3, removing an important piece and maintaining my knight in a strong central position.

Looking at this position, I can see that White has a king on e2 that appears to be in a somewhat exposed position. I have two knights that can create threats - one on e6 and one on d3.

Let me analyze the key tactical opportunities:

1. The knight on d3 is very well-placed and can create immediate threats
2. White's king on e2 looks vulnerable
3. I can potentially create a fork or other tactical motif

The move that stands out to me is **Nd3-f2+**, which would be a knight fork, giving check to the White king on e2 while simultaneously attacking the rook on h1.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Looking at this position, I can see that White has developed aggressively with pieces on d3 (bishop) and f2 (knight), and there's tactical tension in the center. Let me analyze the key features:

1. White's king is on e2, which looks somewhat exposed
2. I have knights on e6 and f2, with the f2 knight being very actively placed
3. My queen on d8 has good mobility
4. There's a pawn tension in the center with my e5 pawn and White's d4 pawn

The knight on f2 is in an excellent outpost position, forking the king and rook. I should look for ways to maximize this tactical advantage.

Let me play a move that increases the pressure:

make_move f2e4

This move:
- Centralizes my knight on an excellent square
- Attacks White's bishop on d3
- Maintains pressure on White's somewhat exposed king position
- Keeps my pieces coordinated and active

Let me analyze the key features:
- White's king is on e3, which seems quite exposed in the center
- My knight on d4 is in an excellent central position
- I have a queen on d8 and rooks that could potentially create threats

Given White's exposed king position on e3, I should look for forcing moves. My knight on d4 is perfectly placed to create threats. Let me play:

make_move d4c2

This knight fork attacks both the White king on e3 and potentially other pieces, forcing White into a difficult position.

Looking at the position, I can see that:

1. My king is on g8 and appears to be in a somewhat exposed position
2. I have a queen on d8 and rooks on a8 and f8
3. White has a knight on b5 that's quite active
4. There's a white bishop on d3 that could be problematic
5. I have a knight on c2 that's in an advanced position

The knight on c2 is in a very strong outpost position and can create threats. Let me look for the most forcing move.

I notice that my knight on c2 can move to several squares. The move Ne1 would be interesting as it attacks the white queen on d3, but I see the queen is actually on d3 and protected.

However, I can play a more forcing move with my knight. Let me play:

make_move c2e3

This move puts my knight on e3, which is a strong central square that forks the king on d3 and potentially creates tactical threats while improving my knight's position.

Looking at the position, I can see:

1. White has a king on d3 that appears somewhat exposed
2. I have a knight on e3 that's well-placed and can create threats
3. My queen on d8 has good mobility
4. White has pieces that could be vulnerable to tactics

Let me analyze some key candidate moves:

- **e3f5**: This knight move attacks the g7 square and centralizes the knight further
- **e3d5**: A strong central outpost for the knight
- **e3c4**: Attacks the white king's position and controls key squares
- **d8d7** or **d8e7**: Bringing the queen into more active play

The knight on e3 is my most active piece. Moving it to c4 would put pressure on White's somewhat exposed king position and control important central squares.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Looking at the position, I can see that White has a knight on d4 that's quite centrally placed and potentially strong. I also notice that White's king appears to be somewhat exposed on d3.

Let me analyze some key candidate moves:

1. **c4d6** - This would be a knight fork, attacking both the queen on d8 and potentially other pieces
2. **c4e3** - Attacks the king directly, forcing it to move
3. **c4d2** - Another attacking move against the king area
4. **e5e4** - A pawn advance that could be strong positionally

The most forcing move appears to be the knight fork. Let me play:

make_move c4d6

This knight move creates a fork, attacking the White queen on d8 and likely forcing White into a difficult position where they'll have to deal with multiple threats.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

I can see this is a complex middlegame position. Let me analyze the key features:

- White's king is on d3, which seems quite active but potentially exposed
- White has rooks on b2 and e3, and a queen on d1
- My king is on g8, and I have rooks on a8 and f8
- My queen is on d8 and I have a knight on d6
- White appears to have some central control

Looking at the available moves, I notice several interesting options:
- Queen moves like Qe8, Qe7, or attacking moves toward White's exposed king
- Knight moves from d6 to various squares
- Pawn advances

Given White's exposed king position on d3, I should look for ways to create threats. The move Qe7 looks promising as it:
1. Centralizes my queen
2. Potentially prepares coordination with my other pieces
3. Keeps pressure on the center

Looking at the tactical possibilities, I notice that White's king on d3 is in a very vulnerable position. My queen on e7 has several attacking options, and my knight on d6 can also contribute to an attack.

Let me look for the most forcing move. The white king on d3 is extremely exposed, and I can give check with my queen.

Looking at the position, I can see that White's king is somewhat exposed on d3, and I have active pieces - my queen on e7 and knight on e4. Let me look for the most forcing move.

I notice that my knight on e4 can move to several squares that would create threats. The move Nf2+ looks very promising as it would be a check, forcing White's king to move and potentially disrupting White's coordination.

Let me examine this: if I play Nf2+, the White king on d3 would be in check from my knight, and the king would be forced to move, likely to c2, c4, or e2. This would be a strong tactical blow.

Looking at this position, I can see that White has a very active position with both rooks on the second rank (c2 and e2) and the queen on d1. My king on g8 looks somewhat exposed, and I need to be careful about tactics.

Let me analyze the key features:
- White's rooks are doubled on the second rank, which is very dangerous
- My queen on e7 is centralized but might be a target
- I have a knight on f2 which is well-placed and attacking White's king position
- My king needs safety

The knight on f2 is in an excellent outpost position. I should look for ways to use it tactically. Let me consider the move Nd3, which would fork the queen on d1 and potentially create threats.

Looking at this position, I can see that White has just played a knight to g5, which appears to be creating some threats. Let me analyze the key features:

1. My king is on g8 and White has a knight on g5 that could be eyeing key squares
2. I have a queen on e7 that's actively placed
3. White's king is on e3, which seems quite exposed in the center
4. I have a knight on d3 that's well-placed

Given White's exposed king position on e3, I should look for tactical opportunities. My knight on d3 is perfectly placed to create threats.

Let me play a move that puts immediate pressure on White's exposed king:

make_move d3c1

This knight move attacks the white king's escape squares and creates immediate tactical threats, forcing White to deal with the pressure on their exposed king position.

Looking at the position, I can see:

- White has a queen on d1 and rooks on c2 and e2
- My king is on g8 and appears to be in a somewhat exposed position
- I have a queen on e7, rooks on a8 and f8, a bishop on c8, and a knight on c1
- White has a knight on g5 which could be threatening

My knight on c1 is in an excellent position deep in White's territory. I notice I can give check with my queen from e7. Let me play:

make_move e7e1

This move puts the White king in check and forces White to respond to the immediate threat, while also potentially setting up tactical opportunities.

Failed to make move: illegal uci: 'e7e1' in r1B2rk1/ppp1qppp/8/4p1N1/P7/1P2KP2/2RPR2P/2nQ4 b - - 0 32

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

I apologize for the illegal move. Let me check my legal moves more carefully and analyze the position again.

Looking at the board and my legal moves list, I can see that e7e1 is not available, which means there must be pieces blocking that path or other constraints.

From my legal moves, I notice I can move my knight on c1 to several squares. Given that this knight is deep in White's position, let me make a strong tactical move:

make_move c1e2

This move captures what appears to be White's rook on e2, which would be a significant material gain.

1. The knight on d4 is very well placed and can create threats
2. My queen on e7 has good scope
3. White's exposed king on e3 suggests tactical opportunities

Looking at the knight moves, **d4e2** stands out as it would be a fork, attacking both the white king on e3 and potentially other pieces. This would be a powerful knight fork.

2. White has a knight on g5 that's actively placed

- Creates counterplay
- Improves my king safety
- Maintains the activity of my pieces

The knight on e2 is in an excellent position and can create threats. Let me consider the move Ne2-d4, which would centralize the knight further and potentially create tactical opportunities.

Looking at this position, I can see that White's king is quite exposed on e4, and I have a knight on d4 that's well-centralized. Let me analyze the key features:

- White's king is on e4, which is very exposed in the center
- My knight on d4 is excellently placed
- White has a knight on g5 
- My queen is actively placed on e7

I notice that my knight on d4 can give a powerful check. Let me play:

make_move d4f3

This move gives check to the White king on e4, forcing it to move and maintaining pressure on White's exposed position. The knight fork also attacks multiple squares and keeps the initiative.

Looking at this position, I can see that White's king is somewhat exposed on e4, and I have a powerful queen on e7. Let me analyze the key features:

1. White's king is centralized but vulnerable on e4
2. My queen on e7 is well-placed and active
3. I have a knight on f3 that's in an excellent outpost
4. White has a rook on c3 and bishop on h3

I notice that my queen can give check and create immediate threats. The move **Qd6+** looks very strong as it:
- Gives check to the White king on e4
- Forces the king to move to a worse square
- Maintains pressure on White's position
- Keeps my pieces coordinated

Looking at this position, I can see:

1. My king is on g8 and appears to be in a somewhat exposed position
2. I have a queen on d6 which is well-centralized
3. I have a knight on f3 which is actively placed
4. White's king is on e4, which is quite advanced and potentially vulnerable
5. White has a queen on a1 and other pieces

Given that White's king is so advanced on e4, I should look for ways to attack it or create threats. My queen on d6 is well-placed, and my knight on f3 has several good options.

Let me make a move that puts pressure on White's exposed king:

make_move f3d4

This knight move to d4 creates multiple threats:
- It attacks the white king on e4
- It centralizes my knight to an excellent outpost
- It gives me more control over key central squares
- It forces White to respond to the check

2. I have a knight on e6 that can be quite active
3. White has a queen on g1 and rook on c2
4. My rooks are on a8 and f8, and my king is on g8

Let me analyze some key candidate moves:

- **e6d4**: This centralizes my knight and attacks White's pieces
- **e6f4**: Also centralizes the knight with good outposts
- **f8d8**: Activates my rook and puts pressure on the d-file
- **a8d8**: Similar rook activation

The knight move to d4 looks very strong as it:
- Centralizes the knight on an excellent square
- Potentially forks or attacks multiple pieces
- Controls key central squares

Looking at this position, I can see:

1. White's king is very actively placed on d5
2. I have a knight on d4 which is well-centralized
3. White has a queen on g1 and rook on c2
4. My rooks are still on their starting squares

The knight on d4 is in an excellent position and I should look for tactical opportunities. Let me examine the knight moves more carefully:

- d4e6+ would be check, forcing the white king to move
- d4c6 attacks the rook on c2
- d4e2 forks the king and queen!

The move d4e2 looks very strong as it's a royal fork - my knight would attack both the white king on d5 and the white queen on g1 simultaneously. This would force White to move the king, and then I can capture the queen.

Looking at this position, I can see that White has a very active king on d5 and a knight on g5. My king appears to be somewhat exposed on g8. Let me analyze the key features:

1. White's king is centralized and active on d5
2. White has a knight on g5 that could be creating threats
3. I have rooks on a8 and f8, and a bishop on c8
4. My knight is on e2, which is quite active

The knight on e2 is in an excellent position and can create immediate threats. Let me look for the most forcing move.

make_move e2d4

This move:
- Centralizes my knight on an excellent square
- Attacks multiple squares and potentially creates threats
- Improves my piece coordination
- The knight will be well-placed to support counterplay

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

I can see this is a complex middlegame position. Let me analyze the key features:

- White's king is on c4, which is quite exposed in the center
- I have a knight on d4 that's very well-placed and active
- White has a rook on c3 and queen on c1
- My king is on g8 with rooks on a8 and f8

The white king's exposed position on c4 suggests I should look for tactical opportunities. My knight on d4 is perfectly placed to create threats.

Looking at the knight moves, I notice that **d4e2** would be a powerful fork, attacking both the white king on c4 and potentially creating other threats. Let me check this move more carefully:

From d4 to e2, my knight would be attacking the white king on c4 (knights move in an L-shape, and from e2 the knight attacks c1, c3, d4, f4, g1, g3 - wait, let me recalculate the knight's attack pattern from e2: it would attack c1, c3, d4, f4, g1, g3. The king is on c4, so this wouldn't be a direct attack on the king.

Let me reconsider. Looking at **d4c2**, this would attack the king on c4 (no, c2 to c4 isn't a knight move either).

Actually, let me look at **d4b3** - from b3, a knight would attack a1, a5, c1, c5, d2, d4. This attacks the queen on c1!

**d4b3** looks like an excellent move as it attacks the white queen on c1, forcing it to move and gaining tempo.

Looking at the available moves, I notice several interesting tactical possibilities. The white king on c4 looks vulnerable, and my knight on b3 is well-placed to create threats.

Let me play a move that puts pressure on the exposed white king:

3. I have rooks on a8 and f8 that need coordination
4. There's a white knight on g5 that could be dangerous

The most logical move appears to be to improve my king safety by castling queenside or moving my king to a safer square. Since I see h8 as an option for my king, this would move my king away from the center and potential threats.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Looking at this position, I can see that White has a very active setup with their king on c2, queen on c1, and rook on e2. My king looks somewhat exposed on h8, and I have a pawn advanced to e4 which could be important.

Let me analyze the key features:
- My king is on h8 and could benefit from better safety
- I have a pawn on e4 that's quite advanced
- White's pieces are centralized and active
- I need to improve my piece coordination

The most logical moves to consider are:
1. Moving my king to safety (f8g8 or h8g8)
2. Advancing my e-pawn further (e4e3 or e4d3)
3. Developing with pawn moves

Given that my king position looks precarious and White has active pieces, I think improving my king safety should be the priority. Moving the king to g8 would be a natural castling-like move to get the king to relative safety.

Looking at this position, I can see that White has a very active setup with their king on c2, queen on c1, rook on e2, bishop on e6, and knight on g5. My king looks somewhat exposed on h8 with limited mobility.

Let me analyze the key features:
- White's pieces are well-coordinated and centralized
- My king position on h8 is somewhat cramped
- I have rooks on a8 and f8 that could potentially become more active
- White's knight on g5 and bishop on e6 are putting pressure on my position

I think the most logical move here is to improve my king safety and give it more breathing room. Moving my king to g8 would centralize it slightly and potentially prepare for better coordination with my rooks.

- White's queen and rook are on the same file/rank, creating potential tactical threats
- My rooks on a8 and f8 are not yet coordinated

I think the best move here is to improve my rook coordination and create counterplay. I'll move my f8 rook to e8, which:
1. Puts pressure on White's rook on e2
2. Improves coordination between my rooks
3. Prepares potential counterplay along the e-file

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

I can see this is an endgame position where I'm in check from the White queen on c1. My king on g8 only has two legal moves: Kh8 or Kf8.

Let me analyze the position:
- White has: King on c2, Queen on c1, Rook on e2, Bishop on f6, Knight on g4, and pawns on a4, e4, h1
- Black has: King on g8, Rooks on a8 and e8, and pawns on a7, b7, c7, g7, h7

The White queen on c1 is giving check along the first rank. Both king moves would get me out of check, but I need to choose the safer square.

Kf8 looks more centralized and keeps more options open, while Kh8 puts my king in the corner which is generally more dangerous in endgames.

- White has a rook on e2 and a queen on c1, creating some pressure
- My king on f8 is somewhat exposed
- White has a bishop on f6 which is quite active
- I have rooks on a8 and e8

The most pressing concern is improving my king safety. The king on f8 is in a vulnerable position, and I should move it to a safer square.

Among the available moves, moving the king to d8 would centralize it and get it away from potential threats along the f-file and the diagonal where White's bishop sits.

Looking at the position, I can see that White has a rook on e2 and a queen on e1, creating some pressure on the e-file. My king is on f8 and appears somewhat exposed. I also notice that White has a bishop on f6 which is quite active.

Let me make a move to improve my king safety by getting it away from the potentially dangerous e-file and the active White pieces.

Let me analyze this position. I can see that:

1. My king is on e7 and appears to be somewhat exposed
2. I have rooks on a8 and d8
3. White has a queen on e1, king on b1, and rook on e2
4. There's a white knight on g5 which could be threatening

Looking at the available moves, I notice several options including rook moves and king moves. The white knight on g5 is in an advanced position and could be creating threats.

I think I should move my king to safety first. Moving the king to f8 would get it to the back rank and away from potential central threats.

2. My king on f8 is in a somewhat precarious position
3. I have rooks on a8 and d8, but they need better coordination
4. White has advanced pawns and pieces creating threats

From the available moves, I need to improve my king safety and piece coordination. The move that stands out is moving my d8 rook to d1, which would:
- Give check to the White king on b1
- Force White to respond to the immediate threat
- Activate my rook on the back rank
- Potentially create counterplay

I can see this is an endgame position where I have a black king on f8, rooks on a8 and d1, a queen on e1, and several pawns. White has a king on b2, a rook on e2, a bishop on e6, and a knight on g5.

Looking at the position, I notice that my queen on e1 and rook on d1 are very actively placed. Let me look for the most forcing move.

I can see that I can give check with my rook on d1. The move Rd2+ would be very strong as it gives check to the white king on b2 and attacks the white rook on e2 simultaneously.

Looking at this position, I can see:

- White has a very active position with the Queen on e1, Rook on d2, Bishop on e5, and Knight on g5
- My King on f8 looks somewhat exposed
- White appears to have tactical threats brewing

Let me analyze the key candidate moves:

1. **f8e8** - Moves the King to e8, but this doesn't look safe with White's pieces so active
2. **f8e7** - King to e7, also looks risky 
3. **a8e8** - Rook from a8 to e8, centralizing the Rook and potentially defending the back rank
4. **a8d8** - Rook to d8, challenging White's Rook on d2
5. **c7c6** or **c7c5** - Pawn breaks to challenge White's Bishop on e5

Given White's aggressive piece placement, I think the most prudent move is to centralize my Rook and improve my King's safety. Moving the Rook to e8 accomplishes both - it gets the Rook to a more active square and provides back rank defense.

Looking at this position, I can see:

- White has a Queen on e1, King on b2, Rook on c2, Bishop on e6, Knight on g5, and pawns on a6, e5, h2
- Black has a King on f8, Rook on e8, and pawns on a7, b7, c7, g7, h7

This appears to be an endgame position where White has a significant material advantage. My rook on e8 is somewhat active, and I need to find the best defensive try.

Looking at my options, I should consider:
1. Moving my rook to create counterplay or defend
2. Moving my king to a safer square
3. Advancing pawns to create some activity

The move e8e7 looks interesting as it keeps my rook active on the 7th rank and potentially creates some defensive coordination. However, let me also consider e8d8 to centralize the rook.

Given the position, I think centralizing my rook is the most practical choice to maintain maximum defensive flexibility.

Looking at this position, I can see that White has a very active setup with their queen on e1, rook on c3, and pieces creating threats. My king on f8 looks somewhat exposed, and I need to improve my position.

Let me analyze the key candidate moves:

1. **d8d1+** - This gives check and forces the White king to move, which could disrupt White's coordination
2. **d8d2** - Attacks along the second rank and puts pressure on White's position
3. **f8e8** - Moves my king to a more central file but might still be exposed
4. **d8e8** - Consolidates my pieces on the back rank

The most forcing move appears to be **d8d1+** as it gives check and forces White to respond to my initiative rather than continuing their own plans.

f8e8,f8e7

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

I can see this is an endgame position where I'm playing as black. Looking at the board, I have:
- Black king on f8
- Black rook on d1
- Black pawns on a7, b7, c7, g7, h7

White has:
- White king on b2
- White queen on f2
- White rook on c3
- White bishop on e6
- White knight on g5
- White pawns on a6, e4, h2

My legal moves are f8e8 and f8e7 - both king moves. Given that White has a queen and multiple pieces creating threats, I need to be very careful with my king safety.

Looking at the position, moving to e8 keeps my king on the back rank, while e7 brings it forward. With White's queen on f2 and other pieces active, I think keeping the king on the back rank might be safer for now.

The black rook on d1 is very actively placed on the first rank. I notice that I can give check with the rook, which is often a good tactical idea in endgames.

Looking at the moves, I can play d1d2+ which would be a check, forcing the white king to move and potentially gaining tempo.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Looking at this endgame position, I can see:

- My king is on e8
- White has a queen on d2, rook on b3, bishop on e6, knight on g5, and pawns on a6, e5, and h2
- White's pieces are actively placed and creating threats

Let me analyze the key candidate moves:

1. **e8f8** - Moves king toward the kingside, but might walk into more danger
2. **e8e7** - Moves king forward, but directly toward White's bishop on e6
3. **c7c6** or **c7c5** - Pawn breaks that could create counterplay
4. **g7g6** - Attacks the knight on g5 and gains space

The knight on g5 is well-placed and attacking, so driving it away seems logical. Also, **g7g6** opens up some breathing room for my king and creates potential escape squares.

Looking at this endgame position, I can see:

- White has: King on c3, Queen on d2, Rook on b3, Bishop on e6, Knight on g5, and pawns on a6, e4, h2
- Black has: King on e8, pawns on a7, b7, c7, g6, h7

This is a difficult endgame for Black with White having significant material advantage. My king on e8 is somewhat exposed, and I need to be careful about White's threats.

Let me analyze the key considerations:
1. The white queen and rook are very active
2. My king needs to find safety
3. I should try to create some counterplay with my pawns if possible

Looking at my options, moving the king to f8 (e8f8) seems like a reasonable choice to:
- Get the king away from the center files where White's major pieces are active
- Potentially prepare to advance my kingside pawns
- Avoid immediate tactical threats

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Looking at this position, I can see that White has a very active position with a Queen on e1, Rook on b3, and other pieces well-coordinated. My King on f8 appears to be in a somewhat precarious position.

Let me analyze the key features:
- My King on f8 is somewhat exposed
- White has a Queen on e1 and Rook on b3 which could be threatening
- I have pawns on b7, c7, g6, and h7
- White has a Bishop on e6 and Knight on g5

Given the tactical nature of this position, I need to prioritize King safety. The move f8e7 would centralize my King but might walk into danger. The move f8g7 looks more natural, getting my King to a safer square on the kingside.

However, let me consider f8e8, which moves my King to the back rank but keeps more options open.

After careful consideration, I think f8g7 is the most prudent choice, as it moves my King away from the center where White's pieces are most active.

Looking at this endgame position, I can see:

- White has: King on b4, Queen on e1, Rook on b3, Bishop on e6, Knight on g5, and pawns on a6, e4, h7
- Black has: King on g7, and pawns on b7, c7, g6, h7

This is a difficult endgame for Black with White having significant material advantage. Let me analyze the key considerations:

1. White's h7 pawn is very advanced and dangerous
2. My king on g7 is somewhat trapped
3. I need to create counterplay or try to improve my king position

Looking at my options:
- King moves: g7h8, g7f8, g7h6, g7f6
- Pawn moves: b7a6, h7h6, c7c6, b7b6, h7h5, c7c5, b7b5

The move h7h6 looks problematic as it advances toward White's pieces. Moving the king to f8 or f6 might give more central activity. However, I notice that b7a6 captures White's advanced pawn, which could be important.

Wait, let me reconsider the position - if White has a pawn on a6, capturing it with b7a6 removes a dangerous passed pawn.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Looking at this endgame position, I can see:

- White has: King on b4, Queen on e1, Bishop on e6, Knight on g5, and pawns on e4 and h1
- Black has: King on g7, Rook on a3, and pawns on a6, c7, and h7

This appears to be a difficult endgame for Black given White's material advantage. Let me analyze the key considerations:

1. My king on g7 is somewhat exposed
2. The white knight on g5 and bishop on e6 are well-placed
3. My rook on a3 is active
4. I need to be careful about potential back-rank threats from the white queen

Looking at my options, I should consider:
- King moves (g7h8, g7f8, g7h6, g7f6) to improve king safety
- Pawn moves (h7h6, h7h5, c7c6, c7c5, a6a5) to create counterplay or improve pawn structure

The move h7h6 looks appealing as it attacks the white knight on g5, forcing it to move and potentially improving my king's position.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Looking at this position, I can see that White has a strong attack with the queen, bishop, and knight. Let me analyze the key threats and my options:

White's pieces are very active:
- The bishop on e6 controls important squares
- The knight on g5 is attacking h7 and putting pressure on my king
- The queen on d1 can quickly join the attack

My legal moves are:
- King moves: g7h8, g7f8, g7f6
- Pawn moves: h6g5 (capturing the knight), c7c6, h6h5, a6a5, c7c5

The most critical decision is whether to capture the knight with h6xg5. This would eliminate a dangerous attacking piece, but I need to consider if this opens up my king position too much.

Looking at g7f6, this seems risky as it walks into the bishop's influence on e6.

I think capturing the knight is the best practical chance, as it removes White's most active attacking piece.

I notice there's a discrepancy - I see a pawn on a7 on the board, but the legal moves show a6a5, suggesting there's actually a pawn on a6. Let me analyze the key legal moves:

- King moves: g7h8, g7h7, g7h6
- Pawn moves: c7c6, c7c5, a6a5, g5g4

Looking at this position, I need to be very careful about the White Queen on f1 and the Bishop on e6. The White King is actively placed on b4, likely trying to support the queenside.

The move a6a5+ looks very appealing as it gives check to the White King on b4, forcing it to move and potentially disrupting White's coordination. This could be a strong tactical shot.

Looking at this position, I need to assess the threats and find the best move. I can see:

1. White has a queen and bishop vs my rook, which is materially disadvantageous
2. My king on g7 has several escape squares
3. I have pawn breaks available with c7-c6, c7-c5, a7-a6, and a5-a4
4. I can also advance my g-pawn with g5-g4

The most pressing concern is improving my king's position and creating counterplay with my pawns. The move c7-c5 looks particularly interesting as it:
- Advances a central pawn
- Potentially creates passed pawn threats
- Gives my pieces more activity

Let me play this active pawn break:

Player_Black (to Proxy):

I see I only have two legal moves with my king: Kg7-h8 or Kg7-h6. This suggests my king might be in check or in a very constrained position.

Looking at the position more carefully, I can see that White's queen on f7 and bishop on e6 are creating serious threats. My king on g7 is indeed in a very tight spot.

Between the two moves:
- Kg7-h8 moves to the back rank corner, which could be dangerous
- Kg7-h6 moves toward the center and gives my king more escape squares

I'll choose the move that gives my king better mobility and avoids the corner trap.

- White pawns on e4 and h2
- Black King on h6
- Black Rook on a3
- Black pawns on a7, a5, c5, g5, h6

This appears to be a complex endgame where I need to be very careful. The white pieces are quite active, especially the queen and bishop working together.

Let me analyze my options:
- King moves (h6h7, h6g7, h6h5) - need to consider king safety
- Pawn advances (a7a6, g5g4, c5c4, a5a4) - creating counterplay

The most forcing move appears to be **g5g4**, advancing my g-pawn to create threats and potentially distract White from any mating attacks. This pawn advance creates counterplay on the kingside and might give me practical chances.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Looking at this endgame position, I can see:

- White King on c3
- White Bishop on e6  
- White Queen on a2
- White pawn on e4 and h1

- Black King on h6
- Black Rook on a3
- Black pawns on a7, a5, c5, g6, g4

This appears to be a complex endgame where I need to be careful about White's threats while trying to advance my pawns or create counterplay with my rook.

Let me analyze the key candidate moves:

1. **g4g3** - Advancing my passed pawn closer to promotion
2. **c5c4** - Advancing another passed pawn
3. **a5a4** - Creating a third passed pawn
4. **King moves** (h6h7, h6g7, h6h5, h6g5) - Improving king position

The most forcing move appears to be **g4g3**, pushing my advanced passed pawn. This creates immediate threats and forces White to respond to the advancing pawn, which is only two squares from promotion.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

I can see this is an endgame position where I have several pieces including a king on h6, and importantly a pawn on g2 that can promote. Let me analyze the key options:

1. **g2g1q** - Promote the pawn to a queen (most powerful piece)
2. **g2g1r** - Promote to a rook  
3. **g2g1b** - Promote to a bishop
4. **g2g1n** - Promote to a knight
5. Various king moves with the king on h6
6. Pawn moves with other pawns

In this endgame position, promoting the pawn on g2 is clearly the strongest move. A queen promotion gives me the most powerful piece and should provide excellent winning chances against White's king and remaining pieces.

- Black King on h6
- Black Queen on g1
- Black pawns on a7, a5, c5, and g6

This appears to be an endgame position. My queen on g1 is very actively placed and can create immediate threats. Let me look for the most forcing move.

I notice that my queen on g1 can give check to the White king on c3. The move g1d1+ would be a powerful check, forcing the White king to move and potentially allowing me to improve my position or create further threats.

Let me analyze the key features:
- White's king is quite active on c3
- My queen on d1 is well-placed and has many options
- I have a rook on a3 that could be useful
- White's queen on b4 is somewhat centralized

I notice that I can give check with my queen, which is often a good way to gain tempo in endgames. Let me look for the most forcing moves:

Looking at this position, I can see that White's king on b2 is in a very exposed position, and I have a powerful queen on d3 that can deliver checkmate.

Let me analyze the key candidate moves:
- d3d2+ would give check, forcing the king to move
- d3b1+ would also give check
- d3c2+ is another checking move

After d3d2+, the White king would be forced to move (likely to a1, a3, b1, or c1), and then I could follow up with a mating attack.

However, I notice an even stronger move: d3c2+ looks like it could be checkmate immediately, as it would attack the king on b2 and control many escape squares.

Let me verify this is the strongest continuation:

Looking at this position, I can see:

- White King on c2
- White Queen on b4 (very active and centralized)
- White Bishop on d7
- White pawns on e4 and h2

- Black King on h6 (somewhat exposed)
- Black Rook on a3 (active on the third rank)
- Black pawns on a7, a5, c5, and g6

The White Queen on b4 is quite powerful and centralized. I need to be careful about my king safety while looking for counterplay.

Let me analyze my options:
- King moves (h6h7, h6g7, h6h5, h6g5) - these could improve king safety
- Pawn advances (c5b4, c5c4, a5b4, a5a4, a7a6, g6g5)

The move **c5c4** looks very promising as it:
1. Advances my passed pawn
2. Gains space in the center
3. Potentially restricts White's pieces
4. Creates threats on the queenside

h6g7,h6g5

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

I can see this is an endgame position where I'm playing as Black. Looking at the board, I have a king on h6 and can move to either g7 or g5. Let me analyze the position:

- My king is on h6
- White has a queen on b4, a king on c2, and a rook on h2
- White also has pawns on e4 and h1
- I have pawns on a7, a4, c4, and g6

This appears to be a difficult endgame for Black given White's material advantage. Let me consider my two options:

1. Kg7 - moves toward the center and away from the white rook
2. Kg5 - moves more aggressively toward White's pawns and centralizes the king

Given that I'm significantly behind in material, I should try to create counterplay and activate my king as much as possible. Moving to g5 centralizes my king better and potentially creates more tactical opportunities.

Looking at this position, I can see:

- My king is on g5 in a somewhat exposed position
- White has a queen on b4 and a king on c2
- I have a rook on a3 and pawns on a5, a7, c4, and g6

Let me analyze the key candidate moves:

1. **c4c3** - This pawn advance puts pressure on White's king and could be very strong, potentially creating threats
2. **a5a4** - Attacks the White queen, forcing it to move
3. King moves to safety (various options)

The move **c4c3** looks particularly attractive because:
- It advances my passed pawn closer to promotion
- It puts direct pressure on White's king on c2
- It could create tactical opportunities

This appears to be the most forcing and promising continuation.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Looking at this endgame position, I can see:

- White has: King on c2, Queen on b4, Bishop on g4, and pawns on e4 and h2
- Black has: King on g5, Rook on a3, and pawns on a7, a5, c3, and g6

This appears to be a complex endgame where Black has some active pieces. My rook on a3 is well-placed, and I have a dangerous passed pawn on c3.

Let me analyze the key candidate moves:
1. King moves (g5h6, g5f6, g5h4, g5g4, g5f4) - These could help support my pawns or avoid checks
2. Pawn moves (a5b4, a7a6, a5a4) - These advance my queenside pawns

The move a5a4 looks very strong as it:
- Attacks White's queen on b4, forcing it to move
- Advances my passed pawn closer to promotion
- Maintains pressure on White's position

Black pieces:

This looks like a difficult endgame for Black, as White has significant material advantage. Let me check what legal moves are available to me.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Looking at this position, I'm in a very difficult endgame with White having a significant material advantage (Queen, Rook, and Bishop vs just pawns). However, I need to try to create the most problems for White.

Let me analyze my options:
- King moves: g5h6, g5f6, g5h5, g5h4, g5f4
- Pawn moves: a7a6, a7a5

The key considerations are:
1. My advanced pawns on a4 and c3 are my main assets
2. I need to keep my king active and try to support these pawns
3. I should avoid getting mated while trying to push for pawn promotion

The move a7a5 looks interesting as it creates a potential passed pawn chain on the a-file, but my king is too far away to support it effectively.

For king moves, I want to stay centralized and active. Moving toward the center with Kf4 or Kf6 keeps more options open than going to the edge with Kh6.

This appears to be an endgame position where my king is very actively placed. Let me analyze the key candidate moves:

2. **g6g5** - Pushes my g-pawn to attack the bishop on f5
3. **f4e5** - Centralizes my king further

The move **g6g5** looks very strong because it attacks the White bishop on f5, forcing it to move and potentially winning tempo. This also advances my passed pawn.

Looking at this position, I can see that my king on f4 is quite active and centralized. Let me analyze the key candidate moves:

1. **f4e5** - This would centralize my king further and potentially support my pawns
2. **f4f3** - This attacks the white king on c2 and gets closer to White's position
3. **f4e3** - This also moves toward the white king
4. **a4a3** - This advances my dangerous passed pawn on the a-file
5. **g5g4** - This advances my kingside pawn

The most critical decision is between advancing my dangerous a-pawn with a4a3 or improving my king position. 

The a-pawn is already quite advanced and could become very dangerous. With the white rook on a2, pushing a4a3 forces White to deal with this immediate threat. If White doesn't respond properly, I could push a3a2 next, creating serious promotion threats.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Looking at this position, I can see this is an endgame with:
- White King on b3
- White Queen on b4  
- White Bishop on f5
- White pawns on e4 and h1
- Black King on f4
- Black Rook on a1
- Black pawns on a7, c3, and g5

This appears to be a critical endgame position. My king on f4 is actively placed, and I have several interesting options. Let me analyze the key candidate moves:

1. **f4e5** - Advances my king toward the center, potentially supporting my pawns
2. **f4e3** - Moves toward White's king and supports my advanced c3 pawn
3. **c3c2** - Pushes my most advanced pawn closer to promotion
4. **g5g4** - Advances my kingside pawn

The move **f4e3** looks very strong because:
- It brings my king closer to White's king, increasing pressure
- It supports my dangerous c3 pawn which is only two squares from promotion
- It centralizes my king on an excellent square
- It maintains coordination between my king and advanced pawns

White pieces:
- King on b3
- Queen on a3
- Rook on a2
- Bishop on f5
- Pawns on e4 and h2

Black pieces:
- King on e3
- Pawns on a7, c3, and g5

This appears to be a complex endgame where I'm significantly behind in material. Let me check what legal moves are available to me.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Looking at this position, I'm in a very difficult situation being down significant material (Queen, Rook, and Bishop vs just pawns). However, I need to look for the most active and forcing moves possible.

Let me analyze the key options:

1. **c3c2** - This advances my most dangerous passed pawn and threatens to promote
2. **g5g4** - Advances another passed pawn
3. King moves like **e3f4** or **e3d4** - Centralizing the king

The move **c3c2** stands out because:
- It creates an immediate threat of promotion on c1
- It forces White to deal with this dangerous passed pawn
- In endgames, passed pawns must be pushed, especially when behind in material
- This gives me the best practical chances to create counterplay

Excellent! I can see that I have a pawn on c2 that can promote. The move c2c1q (promoting to a queen) looks very strong in this position.

Let me analyze the key factors:
- My pawn on c2 can promote to a queen, which would give me a powerful piece
- My king on e3 is actively placed
- White's pieces are somewhat uncoordinated
- Promoting to a queen creates immediate threats and gives me excellent winning chances

Looking at this position, I can see that White's king and queen are very active, and my king is somewhat exposed on e3. However, I have some tactical opportunities with my queen on c1.

Let me analyze the key candidate moves:

1. **c1a3** - This would capture White's queen, which would be an excellent trade since I'm already up material with my extra queen.

2. King moves like **e3f4** or **e3d4** - These could improve my king's position, but I need to be careful about White's threats.

3. **g5g4** - Advancing my passed pawn could create threats.

The most forcing and best move appears to be capturing the White queen:

Looking at this position, I need to assess the critical factors:

1. My king on e3 is very actively placed
2. White has a rook and bishop vs my two pawns
3. My g5 pawn is advanced and could become dangerous
4. The white king on a3 is far from the action

The key decision is whether to advance my g-pawn or use my king more actively. The g4 push looks very tempting because:

- It advances my most dangerous pawn closer to promotion
- It puts pressure on White's pieces
- My king is well-placed to support the pawn's advance
- White's king is too far away to help stop it immediately

Let me push the g-pawn:

4. My rook on a4 is attacking along the 4th rank

The most forcing move appears to be pushing my passed pawn. The g3 pawn is only two squares away from promotion, and advancing it will create immediate threats.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

I can see this is an endgame position where I have a king on e3, a rook on a4, and a pawn on a7 that's close to promoting. White has a king on b5, a bishop on f5, and a pawn on g2 that's about to promote.

The most critical move here is to promote my pawn on g2. Since this is an endgame with limited material, I should promote to a queen for maximum power and winning chances.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Looking at this position, I can see:

- White King on b5
- White Bishop on g6  
- White Pawn on e4
- Black King on e3
- Black Rook on a4
- Black Pawn on h2
- Black Queen on g1

This appears to be an endgame position where I have a material advantage with Queen and Rook versus Bishop. My king is actively placed on e3, and I have several good options.

Let me analyze the key candidate moves:

1. The queen on g1 has many squares available and can create threats
2. My king on e3 is well-centralized and can advance
3. The rook on a4 could potentially create threats along the 4th rank

I think the most forcing move here is to advance my king and put pressure on White's position. The move Kf4 attacks the white pawn on e4 and further centralizes my king.

This appears to be a winning endgame for Black with the extra material (Queen and Rook vs Bishop). The key is to coordinate my pieces effectively.

The white king looks somewhat exposed on b5, and I should look for ways to create threats. Let me consider the queen move Qg1-g5+ which would give check to the white king and force it to move, potentially improving my position.

This appears to be an endgame position. Let me look for the most forcing move. I notice that the White king on c6 is somewhat exposed, and I should look for checks or strong attacking moves.

The move that stands out is **g5d8** - moving my queen to d8, which would give check to the White king on c6 and force it to move, potentially improving my position.

1. The queen has many options from d8
2. My king on f4 can move to e4 or e3
3. The pawn on a7 can advance to a6

The most forcing move appears to be **f4e3**, advancing my king further into White's position. This centralizes my king even more and puts pressure on White's pawns while keeping my king active.

Looking at this position, I have a significant material advantage with my queen and rook against White's bishop. I need to find the most forcing continuation.

I notice that White's king on b5 is somewhat exposed, and I can create immediate threats. Let me examine the most forcing moves:

1. `c7b6+` - This would be check, forcing the White king to move
2. `c7c5+` - Another check option
3. `c7a5+` - Also gives check

Wait, let me reconsider the board. The White king is on b5, so `c7c5+` would give check and force the king to move to a less favorable square.

After `c7c5+`, the White king would be forced to move, likely to a6, b6, or a4/a5 area, and then I can continue with my attack, potentially coordinating my rook and queen for a quick mate.

I can see this is the opening position with White having played 1.e4 (the white pawn is on e4). As Black, I need to respond to this central pawn move. Let me check my legal moves to see all available options.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Perfect! I have many good options available. Looking at the legal moves, I can see classic opening responses to 1.e4. 

I'll play the Sicilian Defense, which is one of the most popular and aggressive responses to 1.e4. This move fights for control of the center and creates imbalanced positions that offer good winning chances for Black.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

I can see this is the early opening phase. White has played 1.e4 and 2.h4 (an unusual second move), and I've responded with 1...c5 (likely the Sicilian Defense).

Looking at the position and available moves, I have several good options:

1. **Nf6** - Develops the knight and attacks the e4 pawn, which is a principled Sicilian move
2. **Nc6** - Develops the queenside knight
3. **d6** or **d5** - Central pawn moves
4. **g6** - Preparing a fianchetto setup

Given that this appears to be a Sicilian Defense, I'll play the most natural developing move that also puts pressure on White's center.

I can see this is an early game position where White has played e4 and h4, while Black has advanced the c-pawn to c5 and developed the knight to f6. Let me analyze the position:

- White has played an aggressive h4, possibly preparing a kingside attack
- My knight on f6 is well-placed, attacking the e4 pawn
- I have a pawn on c5, which is good central control
- White's king is still in the center

Given this position, I want to continue developing my pieces actively. The knight on b8 can go to c6 to support the center and prepare further development.

Looking at the position, I can see that White has developed some pieces (knights on c3 and h3, and has pushed pawns to e4 and h4). I need to continue my development while maintaining a solid position.

I notice that my knight on f6 is well-placed, and I have another knight on c6. My bishops are still on their starting squares, so developing them should be a priority.

Let me play a move that develops my dark-squared bishop while also putting pressure on White's position:

make_move f8e7

This move:
1. Develops my dark-squared bishop to a good square
2. Prepares to castle kingside
3. Maintains flexibility for my pieces
4. Keeps the position solid and doesn't create any weaknesses

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Looking at this position, I can see that White has developed some pieces and advanced pawns in the center (e4, f4) and on the kingside (h4). My king is still in the center and needs safety.

The most pressing concern is getting my king to safety. I have the option to castle kingside with e8g8, which would move my king to g8 and bring my rook to f8.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Looking at the position, I can see that White has advanced pawns on e4 and f4, and has developed knights to c3 and h3. My pieces are reasonably well-placed with knights on c6 and f6, and bishops on e7 and e6.

I notice that White's king is still in the center on f2, which suggests castling rights may have been lost or the king moved early. This could be an opportunity to create pressure.

Let me play a move that improves my position and puts pressure on White's center:

make_move d7d5

This move:
1. Challenges White's pawn center directly
2. Opens up the position for my pieces
3. Gains space in the center
4. Potentially creates tactical opportunities given White's exposed king position

Looking at this position, I can see that White has just played a pawn to e4, and I have several interesting options. Let me analyze the key features:

1. My king is on g8 and appears to be uncastled
2. I have knights on c6 and f6 that are well-placed
3. White's king is on f2, which seems somewhat exposed
4. I have a pawn on e6 that could advance

I notice that my knight on f6 has some excellent squares available. The move Nd5 (f6d5) looks particularly strong as it:
- Centralizes my knight on an excellent outpost
- Attacks White's pawn on e4 (if there's one there)
- Controls key central squares
- Puts pressure on White's position

2. White's king looks somewhat exposed on f2
3. I have tactical opportunities with my active piece placement

I notice that my knight on d5 can move to e3, which would be a powerful outpost giving check to the White king on f2. This move would force the king to move and give me a strong initiative.

Let me look for the most forcing and beneficial move. I see that my knight on e3 can capture something or move to a strong square. Also, my queen on d8 has several options.

One particularly attractive option is to play Nxd5, where my knight on e3 captures what appears to be a pawn or piece on d5, centralizing my knight even further and potentially creating threats.

- I have a knight on c3 that's well-placed and active
- My queen on d8 has some mobility
- White has a bishop on d4 that's centralized but could potentially be attacked

I notice that my knight on c3 can move to e2, which would give check to the White king on f2 and also fork the king and queen on g1. This looks like a strong tactical shot.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Looking at this position, I can see that White has a strong central presence with bishops on b2 and d4, and my king looks somewhat exposed. I notice I have a knight on e2 that's quite active and can create threats.

Let me analyze some key candidate moves:

1. **e2d4** - This would capture White's strong central bishop, which is controlling important squares
2. **e2f4** - Attacks the g2 pawn and centralizes the knight
3. **c6d4** - Another way to capture the central bishop
4. **d8d4** - Queen captures the bishop, but this might be risky

The bishop on d4 is a strong piece that I should eliminate. Between the knight captures, e2d4 looks more natural as this knight is already well-placed.

2. I have knights on c6 and d4 that are well-placed

4. White has a queen on g2 and rooks that could be threats

Looking at the available moves, I notice some interesting tactical possibilities. The knight on d4 is very well-placed and can create threats. Let me examine the move Nd4-e2+, which would be a knight fork checking the white king on f2 and potentially attacking other pieces.

Looking at this position, I can see that White has developed pieces but the king is still in the center on f1, which presents tactical opportunities. I notice I have a knight on e2 that's very actively placed, and my pieces are reasonably coordinated.

Let me analyze some key candidate moves:

1. The knight on e2 has several strong options, including Nd4 which would centralize it powerfully
2. My bishop on e7 could become more active
3. I should look for ways to exploit White's uncastled king

The move Nd4 (e2d4) looks very appealing as it:
- Centralizes my knight on an excellent square
- Puts pressure on White's position
- Controls key central squares
- Potentially sets up tactical themes

2. I have knights on c6 and d4 that are well-placed
3. My bishop on e7 has some mobility
4. White has a bishop on d3 and knight on h3

The knight on d4 is particularly well-placed in the center. I'm looking for moves that can increase pressure on White's somewhat exposed king position.

I think **d4f3+** looks very promising - this would be a knight fork, giving check to the king on f2 while also attacking the queen on h2. This is a powerful tactical blow.

Looking at this position, I can see that White has castled kingside and has developed some pieces, while Black still has the king in the center. Let me analyze the key features:

1. Black's king is still on g8 (uncastled)
2. White has a queen on h2 and bishop on d4 creating some pressure
3. Black has knights on c6 and f3, with the f3 knight being very actively placed
4. Black's pieces are reasonably developed but coordination could be improved

The knight on f3 is in an excellent outpost position and can create threats. Let me look for the most forcing moves. The knight on f3 has several interesting options:

- f3e5: Centralizes the knight and attacks the bishop on d4
- f3d4: Captures the bishop (if it's undefended)
- f3h4: Attacks toward White's king area
- f3g5: Also attacks toward the king

Let me play the most direct move that wins material:

Looking at this position, I can see that White's king is somewhat exposed on f1, and I have some active pieces. Let me analyze the key features:

1. White's king is on f1, which seems unsafe
2. I have a knight on e2 that's very actively placed
3. My queen on d8 has good mobility
4. I have another knight on c6

The knight on e2 is in an excellent position and can create threats. Let me look for the most forcing move.

The knight on e2 can go to several squares, but **e2d4** looks very strong as it:
- Centralizes the knight on an excellent outpost
- Attacks multiple squares
- Puts pressure on White's position
- The knight would be well-supported and difficult to dislodge

Let me analyze this position. I can see that White has their king on f2 and appears to be in a somewhat exposed position. I have knights on c6 and d4, which are well-placed, and my pieces seem actively positioned.

Looking at the available moves, I notice some interesting tactical possibilities. The knight on d4 is very well-placed and can create threats. Let me consider the move Ne2+ (d4e2), which would be a knight fork checking the white king on f2 and potentially attacking other pieces.

I notice that my knight on e2 can move to several strong squares. Let me look for the most forcing move that creates immediate threats.

The move Ne2-g3+ looks very promising as it would give check to the White king on f2, forcing the king to move and potentially winning material or creating a strong attack.

Looking at this position, I can see that White has a strong attacking setup with the queen on h2 and rook on g1, creating threats against my king on g8. I need to address the immediate safety of my king.

Let me analyze the key features:
- My king on g8 is in a precarious position
- White's queen on h2 and rook on g1 are creating mating threats
- I have a knight on g3 that's well-placed and could be useful
- My queen on d8 has good mobility

The most pressing concern is getting my king to safety. Moving the king to g7 would put it on a more active square and away from the back rank, while also potentially preparing to connect my rooks.

Looking at the position, I can see that White has a very active queen on e5 and my king on g7 is in a somewhat exposed position. Let me analyze my options:

1. `g7g8` - Moving my king to the back rank
2. `g7h6` - Moving my king to h6 
3. `e7f6` - Moving my bishop from e7 to f6
4. `c6e5` - Capturing White's queen with my knight!
5. `f7f6` - Pushing my f-pawn

The most striking option is `c6e5`, which would capture White's powerful queen with my knight. This would be a massive material gain (queen for knight is about 4 points of material advantage).

Let me make this capture:

Looking at this position, I can see that White's king is somewhat exposed on e1, and I have some active pieces. Let me analyze the key features:

1. White's king is still on e1 (hasn't castled)
2. I have knights on e5 and e2 that are well-placed
3. My queen on d8 has good mobility
4. White has rooks on g1 and h1

The knight on e2 is particularly well-placed, giving me several tactical options. Let me look for the most forcing move.

I notice that my knight on e2 can move to d4, which would be a strong central outpost, attacking multiple squares and potentially creating threats against White's somewhat exposed king position.

Let me examine the knight on e5 - it can move to f3 with check, which would be a powerful move forcing the White king to move and potentially disrupting White's coordination.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Looking at this position, I can see that White's king is somewhat exposed on f1 with limited escape squares. I have two knights that are well-placed - one on d4 and another on f3, both in excellent central positions.

Let me analyze the most forcing moves:

1. The knight on d4 can give check with Nc2+ or Ne2+
2. The knight on f3 can also create threats

The move Ne2+ looks particularly strong because:
- It gives check to the White king on f1
- It forks the king and potentially other pieces
- It forces White's king to move to a worse square

Let me play this tactical shot:

1. The knight on f3 can give check with Ng1+ or Ne1+
2. I could also consider developing moves or attacking moves
3. My rook on f8 and queen on d8 are on the back rank

Let me look for the most forcing move. I see that my knight on f3 can move to e1, which would give check to the White king on f1.

Looking at this position, I can see that Black is in a complex middlegame with both sides having active pieces. Let me analyze the key features:

- My king is on g7, somewhat exposed
- I have knights on e2 and e1 that are well-placed in White's territory
- White has a rook on g3 and h1, with the king on f1
- There's tactical potential with my advanced knights

The knight on e2 is particularly well-placed and can create threats. Let me look for the most forcing move.

The move **Ne2-f4** stands out because:
1. It attacks the rook on g3, forcing it to move
2. It centralizes the knight to an excellent outpost
3. It maintains pressure on White's position
4. It potentially sets up further tactical ideas

Looking at this position, I can see that White has a rook on e3 and another on h1, with the White king on f1. My king is on g7 and I have various pieces including rooks on a8 and f8, queen on d8, and bishops on c8 and e7.

I notice that White's king position on f1 looks somewhat exposed. Let me look for tactical opportunities.

I see that I can play Qd1+, which would be a check forcing the White king to move. This looks like a strong tactical shot.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

I apologize for the error. Let me check the legal moves again more carefully. Looking at the position, I see that d1 is not in my available moves list.

Looking at my legal moves, I notice I have a knight on e1 (which I can see on the board) that can move to several squares. The move Ne1-f3+ looks particularly interesting as it would give check to the White king on f1.

Looking at this position, I can see that White has a rook on e3 and my knight on f3 is in a very active position. Let me analyze the key features:

1. My king is on g7, somewhat exposed
2. I have a knight on f3 which is deep in White's territory
3. White's king appears to be on f1
4. I have rooks on a8 and f8, and my queen on d8

The knight on f3 is in an excellent outpost position. I can see several attractive options:

- f3e1+ would be a knight fork, giving check to the White king on f1
- f3d2 attacks multiple squares
- f3h2 could be interesting but less forcing

Let me play the most forcing move:

Looking at the position, I can see that White's king is on f1 and appears to be in a somewhat exposed position. I notice I have a knight on e1 that's very actively placed, and my queen on d8 has good mobility.

Let me analyze some key candidate moves:

1. **e1f3+** - This knight move would give check to the White king, forcing it to move
2. **d8d1+** - My queen could potentially give check along the d-file
3. **e1g2** - Attacking and potentially forking pieces

The knight check on f3 looks very strong as it forces the White king to move and maintains pressure.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Looking at the position, I can see that White's king is on f1 and appears to be in a vulnerable position. I have a knight on f3 that can deliver check, and my king is on g7.

Let me analyze my options:
- g7h8, g7g8, g7g6 are king moves
- e7f6 appears to be a bishop move

Wait, let me reconsider the board. Looking more carefully at the position, I see that I have a knight on f3 (♞) that can give check to the White king on f1. However, that move isn't in my legal moves list, which suggests I may be misreading the position.

Given the available moves, let me consider:
- The king moves (g7h8, g7g8, g7g6) 
- The bishop move e7f6

Since e7f6 appears to be the only piece move available (the others being king moves), and considering this could improve my bishop's position or create tactical opportunities, I'll play:

make_move e7f6

The move Nd2+ looks very promising as it would be a check, forcing White's king to move and potentially winning material or creating a strong attack.

- My knight on d2 is actively placed
- I have a bishop on f6 that's controlling important central squares
- White has rooks on e3 and h2

1. Attack the white bishop on c3
2. Centralize my knight on an excellent outpost
3. Potentially create tactical threats against the exposed white king

This move puts pressure on White's position and improves my piece coordination.

Looking at this position, I can see that White has a rook on e3 that's quite active, and my king on g7 is somewhat exposed. I have several pieces that can create threats.

Let me analyze some key candidate moves:

1. My knight on e4 is well-placed and can create threats
2. My bishop on f6 has good scope
3. My queen on d8 has many options

I notice that my knight on e4 can move to several strong squares. The move **e4d2** looks particularly attractive as it would fork the white king on g1 and potentially create tactical threats.

Let me also consider **e4f2+** which would be a check, forcing the white king to move and potentially disrupting White's coordination.

After careful consideration, I think the knight fork is the strongest continuation:

Looking at this position, I can see that White has a rook on f3 that appears to be quite active, and my king on g7 is somewhat exposed. Let me analyze the key features:

1. My king is on g7 and could be vulnerable
2. I have a queen on d8 that's quite active
3. I have a bishop on f6 that's well-placed
4. White has rooks on f3 and h2

I notice that my queen has many good squares available. Let me look for the most forcing and beneficial move.

The move **d8d3** stands out as very strong - it would attack White's rook on f3 and potentially create threats against White's king position. This forces White to deal with the immediate threat to the rook.

Looking at this position, I can see that White has their king on g1 and appears to be in a somewhat exposed position. I have a powerful queen on d3 and several pieces that can create threats.

Let me analyze the key features:
- My queen on d3 is very active and centralized
- White's king looks vulnerable on g1
- I have a bishop on f6 that's well-placed
- White has rooks on f3 and d4

I notice that my queen on d3 has many powerful options. Let me look for the most forcing move that creates immediate threats.

The move d3d1+ looks very promising as it would be a check, forcing White's king to move and potentially leading to a winning attack.

Wait, let me double-check the legal moves list... I see d3d2 and d3f1 but not d3d1. Let me reconsider.

Looking at the position again, I think d3f1+ would be a powerful check if the king is indeed on g1. From the legal moves, I can see d3f1 is available.

Let me analyze this position. I can see that:

1. My king is on g7 in what appears to be an endgame position
2. I have rooks on a8 and f8, a bishop on f6, and several pawns
3. White has rooks on d2 and f1, a bishop on c2, king on g1, and pawns

Looking at the legal moves, I notice some interesting tactical possibilities:

- My bishop on f6 has many squares available, including some that could create threats
- My rook on f8 can move along the back rank
- The move g7h8 suggests my king can move to h8

Let me look for the most forcing move. I see that f6d8 would centralize my bishop and potentially create threats. However, f6e5 looks very strong as it would centralize the bishop on an excellent square, potentially supporting my pawns and creating threats against White's position.

- White's king looks somewhat exposed on g1
- I have a powerful bishop on e5 that's well-centralized
- My rook on f8 is on the same file as White's rook on f1
- I have some tactical possibilities

One move that stands out is **e5h2** - this would move my bishop from e5 to h2, which appears to give check to the White king on g1 (since h2 is on the diagonal attacking g1). This would be a forcing move that puts immediate pressure on White.

Looking at this position, I can see that White has a rook on f6 and my king is on g7, which puts me in a difficult endgame situation. Let me analyze the key features:

1. My king on g7 is somewhat restricted
2. I have a rook on f8 that needs to become more active
3. White's rook on f6 is well-placed
4. I have several pawn moves available

The most important consideration is to activate my rook and improve my king's position. Moving my rook to the back rank horizontally will give it more scope and potentially create counterplay.

This move:
- Activates my rook along the 8th rank
- Keeps my rook safe from immediate attack

Looking at this position, I can see that White has a material advantage and my king on g7 appears to be in a somewhat precarious position. Let me analyze the key features:

- White has a rook on f6 and bishop on c3, creating pressure
- My king is on g7 with limited mobility
- I have rooks on a8 and h8, a bishop on c8, and several pawns

From the available moves, I need to find the most constructive option. Let me consider:

1. **h8g8** or **h8f8** - Moving the rook to potentially create counterplay
2. **c8d7** - Developing the bishop to a more active square
3. **e6e5** - Advancing the central pawn to gain space
4. Pawn moves like **h7h6**, **f7f6**, etc. - Defensive but passive

Given the position, I think **c8d7** is the most logical move. It:
- Develops my bishop to a more active square
- Potentially prepares to coordinate my pieces better
- Doesn't weaken my king position further

Looking at the position, I can see:

- I have a rook on a8 that can move along the 8th rank
- My king is on g7 and can move to h8
- I have a bishop on d7 with several options
- Various pawn moves are available

The position appears to be in an endgame. I notice that White has a rook on h8 and another rook on f6, plus a bishop on c3. My king on g7 seems somewhat constrained.

Let me analyze the most promising moves:

1. The rook moves along the 8th rank could be useful for activity
2. Moving the king to h8 might not be ideal as it could be more restricted there
3. The bishop on d7 has good mobility

I think activating my rook is the priority here. Moving it to challenge White's position or create counterplay seems best.

g7g8,g7f8

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

I can see this is an endgame position where I have a black king on g7 that can move to either g8 or f8. Let me analyze the position:

- My king is on g7
- White has a king on h1, a bishop on c2, and rooks on h7 and f1
- I also have a rook on e8 and a bishop on d7

Looking at the position, my king appears to be under some pressure from the white rook on h7. Between the two legal moves:

- g7g8 would move my king to the back rank
- g7f8 would move my king toward the center and away from the h7 rook

Moving to f8 seems better as it gets my king away from the immediate pressure of the rook on h7 and gives me more central control.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Looking at the position, I can see that White has two rooks actively placed on f6 and f4, which are quite threatening. My king on e8 is somewhat exposed, and I need to improve my position.

Let me analyze the key candidate moves:

1. **f8g8** - Moves my rook to safety and potentially prepares to defend along the back rank
2. **e8d8** or other king moves - Improves king safety
3. **d7c6** - Centralizes my bishop
4. **e6e5** - Advances my pawn and potentially challenges White's rook on f4

The most pressing concern is improving my king safety and coordinating my pieces better. Moving my rook from f8 to g8 accomplishes several things:
- Gets the rook to a safer square
- Keeps it on the back rank for defense
- Potentially prepares to support the g-file later

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Looking at this position, I can see that White has two rooks on f7 and h7, creating significant pressure. My king on e8 is in a precarious position, and I need to find the best defensive move.

Let me analyze the key candidate moves:

1. **e8f8** - Moves the king toward the rook on f7, which seems dangerous
2. **e8d8** - Centralizes the king but may still be exposed
3. **e8c8** - Moves the king away from immediate threats
4. **d7c6** - Develops the bishop to a more active square
5. **e6e5** - Advances the pawn to gain space

The position looks quite difficult for Black. White's rook pair on the 7th rank is very strong. However, I think the most important thing right now is to improve my king safety.

After careful consideration, I believe moving the king to c8 gets it further away from White's immediate threats and potentially prepares to connect with my rook on e8 (wait, that's where my king is).

Looking more carefully, I think **d7c6** might be the best move, as it develops my bishop to a more active square where it can potentially help in defense and doesn't worsen my king position immediately.

Looking at this position, I can see that White has a significant material advantage with two rooks, while I have a rook and bishop. My king on e8 is somewhat exposed, and I need to be careful about potential back-rank threats.

Let me analyze the key features:
- White's rooks on b7 and h7 are very active
- My king is on the back rank with limited escape squares
- My bishop on c6 is well-placed and active
- I have a passed pawn on e6

The most forcing and best move appears to be **c6e4**, centralizing my bishop and putting pressure on White's position. This move:
1. Centralizes the bishop to a strong square
2. Keeps pressure on White's position
3. Maintains tactical possibilities
4. Improves my piece coordination

- I have a bishop on e4 that's very active in the center
- I have pawns on a7, c5, and e6

The position looks like an endgame where I need to be active. My bishop on e4 is excellently placed, controlling many important squares. Let me look for the most forcing move.

I notice that my bishop can capture something on h7 (Bxh7+), which would be a check since the white king appears to be on h7. This would be a very forcing move.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Looking at this position, I can see:

- My king is on g8 and White has a rook on b7 that's quite active
- I have a rook on e8, a bishop on h7, and pawns on a7, c5, and e6
- White has rooks on b7 and h6, a bishop on c3, king on h3, and several pawns

The position looks like an endgame where material is roughly equal but White's pieces are more actively placed. Let me look for the most forcing and active move.

I notice that my rook on e8 has several options along the back rank. Moving to e7 would centralize the rook and potentially create counterplay. However, I should also consider advancing my passed pawn on c5.

The move c5-b4 advances my passed pawn and creates immediate threats, forcing White to deal with it. This seems like the most forcing continuation.

g8h8,g8f8

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

I can see this is an endgame position where I'm playing as black with a king on g8 and a rook on e8, while white has a king on h1, a bishop on c1, and rooks on b7 and h6.

My legal moves are:
- g8h8 (king to h8)
- g8f8 (king to f8)

Looking at the position, white's rook on h6 is controlling the h-file and the 6th rank, while the rook on b7 controls the 7th rank. The white king is relatively safe on h1.

Moving to h8 would put my king in the corner, which is generally dangerous in endgames as it reduces mobility. Moving to f8 keeps more central control and maintains better king activity.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Looking at this endgame position, I can see:

- Black king on e8
- Black rook on e8 (wait, that can't be right - let me reanalyze)
- Black pawns on a7, e6, and b4
- White has rooks on b7 and g6, king on g1, bishop on c2, and pawns on a5, c4, and h4

Actually, looking more carefully at the position and the legal moves, I see the black rook must be on e8 and the black king on f8. The legal moves show rook moves along the 8th rank and pawn advances.

This appears to be a rook and pawns endgame. The key considerations are:
1. Activating the rook
2. Advancing the passed pawns
3. King safety

The move b4-b3 looks very promising as it advances a dangerous passed pawn that's already quite far advanced. This pawn could become a serious threat and force White to deal with it.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Looking at this endgame position, I can see:

- Black king on e8
- Black rook on e8 (wait, that can't be right - let me reread the board)
- Black pawn on a7 
- Black pawn on e6
- White has a king on h3, bishop on b6, rook on b7, rook on g6, and some pawns

Actually, looking more carefully at the board and the legal moves, I see the black rook is on e8 and the black king must be on f8. The legal moves show the rook can move along the 8th rank or down to e7.

In this position, I need to be careful about the white rooks that are actively placed. The rook on b7 is attacking my a7 pawn, and the rook on g6 is well-placed.

I think the best move is to activate my rook and create some counterplay:

make_move e8e7

This move:
1. Activates the rook to a more central square
2. Potentially prepares to support the advance of my e6 pawn
3. Gets the rook off the back rank where it might be more vulnerable to tactics

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Looking at this position, I can see:

- My king is on f8
- White has two rooks on e7 and g6
- White has a bishop on b3
- White's king is on h2
- I have pawns on a7 and e6

The position looks quite difficult for black with White's active rooks. Let me analyze my three legal moves:

1. **f8e7** - This would put my king directly next to White's rook on e7, which seems very dangerous
2. **a7a6** - This advances my a-pawn but doesn't address the immediate threats
3. **e6e5** - This advances my e-pawn, potentially creating some space and activity

Given that f8e7 appears to walk into immediate danger by moving next to the White rook, and a7a6 seems passive, I think advancing the e-pawn is the most constructive option. It gives my king a bit more breathing room and advances my pawn toward promotion.

- White bishop on b3
- White pawns on a5, c4, and h4

This appears to be a difficult endgame for black. Let me analyze the three available moves:

1. **f8e7** - Moving the king toward the center, but this walks into the white rook on e7
2. **a7a6** - Advancing the a-pawn, but white's a5 pawn is already advanced and this doesn't seem to help much
3. **e5e4** - Pushing the central pawn forward, creating a passed pawn and potentially giving black some counterplay

The central pawn advance seems most promising as it creates activity and a potential threat. Even though the position looks challenging, pushing for counterplay with the e-pawn is the most principled approach.

**White pieces:**
- King on g2
- Two Rooks on e7 and g6
- Bishop on d1
- Pawns on a5, c4, and h4

**Black pieces:**
- King on f8
- Pawns on a7 and e4

This looks like a difficult endgame for Black. White has a significant material advantage with two rooks and a bishop versus just two pawns. Let me check what legal moves are available.

- f8e7 (King takes the rook on e7)
- a7a6 (advance the a-pawn)
- e4e3 (advance the e-pawn)

Given the position, taking the rook with my king is clearly the best option. This will reduce White's material advantage significantly and give me better practical chances in the endgame.

I can see this is an endgame position. Let me analyze what's on the board:

- Black King on e7
- Black pawns on a7 and e4
- White King on f1
- White Rook on g6
- White Bishop on d1
- White pawns on a5, c4, and h4, h7

This appears to be a complex endgame. Let me check what legal moves are available to me as Black.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Looking at this endgame position, I need to carefully evaluate my options. I have:
- King on e7 with several escape squares
- Pawn on a7 that could advance
- Advanced pawn on e4 that could push to e3

The white rook on g6 and bishop on d1 are actively placed. My e4 pawn is quite advanced and could become dangerous.

Let me push my passed pawn closer to promotion:

make_move e4e3

This advances my most dangerous pawn and puts pressure on White. The pawn on e3 will be very close to queening and forces White to deal with this immediate threat.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

I can see this is an endgame position where I have a black king on e7, a white rook on g6, white bishops on h8 and e2, and some pawns. Looking at my legal moves, I notice that e7f8, e7e8, and e7d8 are moves to the 8th rank.

Given that I have moves to the back rank available, this suggests I might be able to create some tactical opportunities or escape from potential threats. Let me analyze:

- The white rook on g6 appears to be controlling some key squares
- I have a pawn on a7 that can advance
- My king has several options

I think the most active move would be to advance my king toward the center or create counterplay. Moving to f8 keeps my king active and potentially prepares to support my pawn or create threats.

Looking at this endgame position, I can see:

- Black king on f8
- Black pawn on a7
- White king on f1
- White rook on g6
- White bishop on c3
- White bishop on e2
- White pawns on a5, c4, and h4

This appears to be a difficult endgame for black. The white rook is actively placed on g6, and I need to be careful about king safety while trying to advance my pawn.

Let me analyze the options:
- f8e8, f8f7, f8e7: King moves
- a7a6: Pawn advance

The pawn on a7 is being blocked by white's pawn on a5, so a7a6 would just put my pawn in a more vulnerable position where it could be captured.

For the king moves, I need to avoid walking into tactics. The rook on g6 is controlling the 6th rank, and I should try to improve my king position while staying safe.

f8e7 looks like a reasonable centralization move, getting the king more active while avoiding immediate threats.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Looking at this position, I'm in a very difficult endgame. White has significant material advantage with a rook and two bishops versus just my king and pawn. 

Let me analyze my options:

1. **King moves (e7f8, e7e8, e7d8, e7f7, e7d7, e7e6, e7d6)** - These would be retreating or lateral moves
2. **Pawn move (a7a6)** - This advances my only remaining pawn

The key consideration is that my a7 pawn is my only hope for creating counterplay. White's a5 pawn is quite advanced, but if I can push my a-pawn and potentially promote it, that might be my only chance.

However, I need to be careful about king safety. Moving the king toward the center or away from supporting the pawn could be problematic.

Let me advance my pawn to create some activity and potential threats:

I can see my available moves with the black king on e7. This is indeed a very challenging position - I'm down a rook and two bishops with only a king and pawn remaining.

Looking at the position, White has a significant material advantage and will likely be trying to promote pawns or deliver checkmate. My best strategy is to:

1. Keep my king active and centralized if possible
2. Try to create counterplay with my a-pawn
3. Make it as difficult as possible for White to convert their advantage

Given the current position, I'll move my king towards the center to maintain maximum mobility and potentially support my a-pawn's advance.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

I see I only have king moves available: e6f7, e6e7, and e6d7. This suggests my rook on g6 might be pinned or there's some tactical constraint I need to be aware of.

Looking at the position more carefully, I need to choose the best king move. Let me analyze each option:

1. **e6f7** - Moves the king toward the 7th rank, potentially supporting the rook
2. **e6e7** - Moves the king up the e-file 
3. **e6d7** - Moves the king toward the center/queenside

In rook endgames, it's generally good to centralize the king and coordinate with the rook. The move e6e7 keeps my king centralized and moves it forward, which is typically a good principle in endgames - activating the king.

- Black King on e7
- Black Rook on g6
- Black pawn on a6
- White King on f1
- White Bishop on e4
- White Bishop on c3
- White pawns on a5, c4, and h4

This appears to be an endgame position. Let me check what legal moves are available to me as Black.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

I can see my legal moves are all king moves: e7f8, e7e8, e7d8, e7f7, e7d7.

Looking at the position, I have a rook on g6 which should give me good winning chances in this endgame. However, I notice that my king moves are quite limited, suggesting I might be in check or facing some tactical pressure.

Let me analyze the position more carefully:
- White has two bishops and pawns vs my rook and pawn
- My rook on g6 is actively placed
- I need to keep my king safe while trying to coordinate with my rook

Given the available king moves, I think moving to f8 would be a good choice as it:
1. Keeps the king relatively centralized
2. Moves toward the back rank where it might be safer
3. Potentially allows better coordination with my rook

f8g8,f8f7

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

I can see this is an endgame position where I'm playing as black with just a king on f8, while white has a king on f1, a rook on e6, and some pawns and bishops.

Looking at my two legal moves:
- f8g8: Move king to g8
- f8f7: Move king to f7

Given that white has a rook on e6 and I need to avoid getting checkmated, I should analyze which king move gives me better chances. Moving to f7 would bring my king closer to the center and potentially give me more escape squares, while g8 would keep me on the back rank which could be more dangerous with the white rook active.

Let me move my king to f7 to try to improve my king's activity and avoid back rank issues.

I can see my legal moves are:
- f7g8 (King to g8)
- f7f8 (King to f8) 
- f7e7 (King takes Rook on e7)

Wait, that last move doesn't make sense - f7e7 would mean my king is capturing my own rook, which shouldn't be legal. Let me analyze the position more carefully.

Looking at the board again, I have:
- King on f7
- Rook on e7

The legal moves suggest I can move my king to g8, f8, or to e7. If e7 is a legal destination, that means there must be a White piece there that I can capture, not my own rook.

Let me reconsider the board position. The piece on e7 must be a White rook that I can capture.

Given this is an endgame with limited material, I should look for the most active move. Capturing the rook on e7 would be winning material, which is typically the best option in an endgame.

- White has two bishops and three pawns vs my king and one pawn
- My pawn on a6 is blocked by White's pawn on a5
- White's bishops control many squares and the white king can support the advance of the pawns

Looking at my options:
- e7f8, e7e8, e7d8 move toward the back rank
- e7f7, e7d7 move along the 7th rank  
- e7e6 moves forward toward the center

In this difficult endgame, I need to try to create counterplay or at least make White's task as difficult as possible. Moving toward the center with e7e6 seems most active, as it:
1. Centralizes my king
2. Potentially allows me to support my a-pawn later
3. Doesn't retreat passively to the back rank

Let me analyze the position more carefully. This looks like a bishop and pawn endgame where piece activity and king position are crucial. 

The white bishop on e4 is well-centralized, and White has a passed pawn on the a-file that's quite advanced (a5). My pawn on a6 is blocking it for now.

Looking at my options:
- e6f7: Moves toward the kingside
- e6d7: Moves toward the center/queenside  
- e6d6: Advances toward the center
- e6f6: This must be capturing something on f6

Given that this is an endgame, king activity is paramount. I want to centralize my king and potentially support my pawn or stop White's passed pawn.

The white bishop on f6 is controlling some key squares, and white has a passed pawn on a5 that's quite advanced. My king is currently on d6, and I need to be careful about the white king's position on f2.

Looking at my options:
- d6d7: Moves toward the back rank
- d6c7: Moves toward the queenside where white's passed pawn is
- d6e6: Moves toward the center/kingside
- d6c5: Moves forward and toward the queenside, potentially supporting my own pawn

Given that white has a dangerous passed pawn on a5, I should consider moving toward the queenside to help deal with it. The move Kc5 looks promising as it:
1. Moves toward white's passed pawn
2. Supports my own pawn on a6
3. Keeps my king active

I can see this is an endgame position. Let me analyze what's on the board:

- Black King on c5
- Black pawn on a6
- White King on g2
- White pawns on a5, c4, h4
- White bishops on f6 and e4

This appears to be a complex endgame with bishops and pawns. Let me check what legal moves are available to me as Black.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

I can see I have three legal moves with my king:
- c5d6 (king to d6)
- c5c4 (king to c4) 
- c5b4 (king to b4)

Let me analyze this position carefully:

1. My pawn on a6 is blocked by White's pawn on a5
2. White has two bishops which gives them strong control
3. White's king on g2 seems relatively safe
4. The key battle appears to be around the queenside pawns

Looking at my options:
- Kd6 moves toward the center and keeps flexibility
- Kc4 attacks White's pawn but the king might be exposed to the bishops
- Kb4 supports my a6 pawn and attacks the a5 pawn

Given that White has the bishop pair advantage, I need to be active with my king. Moving to c4 to attack the pawn seems most principled, as it creates immediate threats and forces White to respond.

This is a critical position. I notice I can capture the white bishop on d4, which would be a significant material gain. Taking the bishop eliminates one of White's key pieces and improves my chances considerably in this endgame.

I can see the available king moves. Let me analyze this endgame position:

- I have a king on d4 and a pawn on a6
- White has a king on g1, bishop on e4, and pawns on a5 and h4
- My pawn is blocked by White's pawn on a5

The key considerations are:
1. White's bishop controls important squares
2. My king is actively placed in the center
3. I need to be careful not to allow White's king to become too active

Looking at my options, I want to maintain my king's central activity while potentially supporting my pawn or creating counterplay. The move Kc5 looks promising as it:
- Keeps my king active
- Supports the advance of my a-pawn if the a5 pawn moves
- Maintains central control

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Looking at this endgame position, I need to analyze the pawn structure and king activity. I have a black pawn on a6 facing a white pawn on a5, and White has a bishop and an extra pawn on h3.

The key considerations are:
1. My king needs to stay active and centralized
2. I should try to blockade or attack White's passed pawns
3. I need to create counterplay with my own pawn

From the available moves (c5d6, c5b5, c5d4, c5c4, c5b4), I think the most principled move is to advance my king toward the center and White's bishop, while maintaining flexibility.

make_move c5d4

This centralizes my king, puts pressure on White's bishop, and keeps my king active in the center of the board where it can influence both sides of the position.

1. White has a dangerous passed pawn on a5 that's advancing toward promotion
2. My pawn on a6 is blocking it for now
3. White's king on e2 and bishop on e4 are controlling key squares
4. I need to either create counterplay or try to stop White's threats

The move Kxe4 (d4e4) looks very appealing because:
- It captures White's bishop, eliminating a key piece
- It centralizes my king
- It removes White's control over important squares
- In the resulting king and pawn endgame, I might have better drawing chances

Looking at this king and pawn endgame, I need to evaluate my options carefully. My king is actively placed on e4, and I have several king moves available.

Key considerations:
1. The white king on d1 is far from the action
2. I have a passed pawn on a6 that could become dangerous
3. White has pawns on a5 and h4
4. My king needs to support my pawn or stop White's pawns

The move Kf5 (e4f5) looks very strong because:
- It advances my king toward White's h4 pawn
- It maintains central control
- It keeps my king active and well-placed
- From f5, my king can potentially reach the h-pawn or support my own pawn advancement

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Looking at this endgame position, I need to analyze the pawn structure and king activity. White has pawns on a5 and h4, while I have a pawn on a6 that's blocking White's a-pawn.

The key considerations are:
1. My king is actively placed on f5
2. White's h-pawn on h4 could become dangerous if it advances
3. I need to maintain control and possibly create counterplay

From my available moves (f5g6, f5f6, f5e6, f5e5, f5g4, f5f4, f5e4), I should focus on:
- Staying active with my king
- Potentially stopping White's h-pawn
- Maintaining good positioning

I think the best move is to advance toward White's h-pawn while keeping my king centralized and active.

I can see this is an endgame position with very few pieces remaining:
- White King on b1
- White pawns on a5 and h4
- Black King on g4
- Black pawn on a6

This appears to be a king and pawn endgame. Let me check what legal moves are available to me.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Looking at this position, I can see that White has a passed pawn on a5 that's quite advanced, and my king is actively placed on g4. Let me analyze the key candidate moves:

1. **g4h4** - This would capture White's pawn, which is very attractive
2. **g4h5, g4h3** - Moving toward the h-file to stop any potential pawn advances
3. **g4f5, g4f4, g4f3** - Moving toward the center/queenside

The most obvious move here is to capture the white pawn on h4. This eliminates one of White's pawns and gives me material advantage in this endgame. With my king actively placed and White's king far away on b1, capturing this pawn should give me excellent winning chances.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

I notice there's a discrepancy between the board display and the legal moves. The board shows my king on h5, but the legal moves suggest my king is on h4. Let me work with the legal moves provided, which indicate my king is actually on h4.

Looking at this king and pawn endgame, I need to:
1. Try to stop White's a-pawn from promoting
2. Support my own a6 pawn if possible

The key principle in king and pawn endgames is king activity. Let me analyze the options:

- Kh5: Moves toward the center/White's king
- Kg5: Moves toward the center 
- Kg4: Moves toward the center and White's king
- Kh3: Moves away from the action
- Kg3: Moves toward White's king

In this position, I want to centralize my king and get it closer to the White king to create counterplay. The most active move appears to be Kg4, which brings my king closer to the center and toward White's position.

I see my king is actually on g4 (not g3 as I initially read). Looking at this position, I have a white pawn on a5 and my pawn on a6, with the white king on b1 and my king on g4.

This is a race situation where both sides are trying to promote their pawns. The key is to calculate whether I can stop White's pawn or if I need to create counterplay with my own king.

Let me analyze: White's pawn is on a5, and with the white king on b1 supporting it, White is threatening to push a6 (capturing my pawn) and then promote. However, my king is much more active.

I should advance my king toward White's position to create threats. The most direct approach would be to head toward the white king and pawn.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Looking at this position, I can see that White has a passed pawn on a5 that could become dangerous if it advances. My king is currently on f3 and I need to decide whether to try to stop White's pawn or advance my own.

Let me analyze the key considerations:
1. White's pawn is on a5, and my pawn is on a6, blocking its advance
2. My king is relatively centralized on f3
3. I need to either support my pawn or try to create counterplay

Since my pawn on a6 is currently blocking White's pawn, and my king is well-placed in the center, I think the best move is to improve my king's position while maintaining flexibility. Moving to f4 would centralize my king further and keep options open for both supporting my pawn and controlling key squares.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

I can see I have 8 possible king moves. In this king and pawn endgame, I need to analyze the position carefully.

The white pawn on a5 is blocked by my pawn on a6, so White cannot make progress on the queenside without capturing my pawn. My strategy should be to:

1. Use my king actively to create threats
2. Either support my a6 pawn or create counterplay elsewhere
3. Try to force White's king into a passive position

Looking at the position, I want to advance my king to create maximum activity. The move f4-f5 advances my king up the board and maintains central control, putting pressure on White while keeping my king active.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

I can see this is a critical king and pawn endgame. The white pawn on a5 is threatening to advance, and my pawn on a6 is blocking it. The key in this position is to use my king actively.

Looking at the position:
- White's king on b2 is supporting the a5 pawn
- My king on f5 needs to get involved in the action
- The white pawn is currently blocked by my a6 pawn

In king and pawn endgames, the principle is usually to activate the king and create counterplay or stop the opponent's threats. Since White's king is already close to the pawn action on the queenside, I need to either:
1. Rush my king toward the queenside to help defend
2. Create counterplay on the kingside

Given that White's king is already well-placed near the a-pawn, I should head toward the queenside to contest the area and potentially create a drawn position.

My strategic goals are:
1. Keep the white king away from supporting its pawn
2. Advance my king toward the white king to gain space
3. Eventually create threats that will win the game

The white king on a2 is quite far from the action. I should advance my king to gain more central control and create winning chances.

Looking at this king and pawn endgame, I need to analyze the position carefully. White has a passed pawn on a5 that's being blocked by my pawn on a6. The key is to use my king actively.

White's king on b3 is supporting the a5 pawn, and if White plays Kb4-b5, they'll be attacking my a6 pawn. I need to either:
1. Support my a6 pawn with my king, or
2. Create counterplay elsewhere

Given the position, I should bring my king closer to support the a6 pawn and potentially create threats. Moving towards the queenside makes the most sense.

- White King on c3
- White pawn on a5
- Black King on d5
- Black pawn on a6

This appears to be a king and pawn endgame. Let me check what legal moves are available to me as Black.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Looking at this king and pawn endgame, I need to analyze the position carefully. The white pawn on a5 is attacking my pawn on a6, and I have several king moves available.

Key considerations:
1. My pawn on a6 is under attack from the white pawn on a5
2. The white king on c3 is actively placed
3. I need to either defend my pawn or create counterplay

Let me analyze the options:
- Moving towards the white king (Kc5, Kc6) could be aggressive but might lose my pawn
- Moving away (Ke6, Kd6, Ke5) might allow White to capture my pawn
- Ke4 brings my king closer to the white king and centralizes it

In king and pawn endgames, king activity is crucial. I think the most principled move is to activate my king and fight for the center.

This is a crucial king and pawn endgame. I need to analyze the position carefully:

- White has a pawn on a5 and king on c4
- Black has a pawn on a6 and king on e4
- The white pawn is blocked by my pawn on a6

In this type of endgame, the key is to use my king actively. Since the white king is on c4, I need to consider whether to advance my king or move it to support my pawn.

Looking at the position, if I can get my king to the queenside to support my a6 pawn while the white king is tied to supporting the a5 pawn, I might be able to create winning chances.

The move e4e3 advances my king toward the center and potentially toward the queenside, while e4f3 also advances the king but in a different direction.

I can see I have 8 possible king moves. In this king and pawn endgame, I need to analyze the position carefully.

The white pawn on a5 is blocked by my pawn on a6, so White cannot make progress on the queenside without king support. The key is to use my king actively.

Looking at the position:
- White's king is on b4, trying to support the a5 pawn
- My king on e3 is well-centralized
- I should maintain king activity and look for opportunities to either support my own pawn or create counterplay

The most active move appears to be advancing my king toward the center or toward White's king to maintain pressure. Moving to e4 keeps my king centralized and active.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

This is a crucial king and pawn endgame. I need to analyze the position carefully:

- White has a pawn on a5 and Black has a pawn on a6, creating a blocked pawn structure on the a-file
- The outcome will depend on king activity and who can create threats first
- My king on e4 is currently well-centralized

Let me think about the key principles:
1. In king and pawn endgames, king activity is paramount
2. I need to either support my own pawn's advance or stop White's king from becoming too active
3. The white king on c3 seems to be heading toward my pawn on a6

Looking at my options:
- e4f5, e4e5, e4d5 move toward the center/kingside
- e4f4, e4f3, e4e3 move toward different squares

Since the a-pawns are blocked, this will likely come down to king activity. I should maintain my centralized king position while being ready to react to White's plans.

Since White's king is on b4 supporting the a5 pawn, I should try to activate my king and create threats. Moving towards the center or towards White's king seems logical.

Let me move my king to e4, centralizing it and potentially creating more active play:

2. My king on e4 is centralized but far from the queenside action
3. I need to either support my a6 pawn or try to create counterplay

The critical question is whether I can stop White's a-pawn if it advances, or if I should try to activate my king toward the center/kingside.

Given that White's king is close to supporting the a5 pawn advance, I think I need to improve my king position while maintaining flexibility. Moving toward the center and slightly closer to the queenside seems logical.

In this position, I need to be careful about king activity. The key principles here are:
1. Keep my king active and centralized
2. Prevent the white king from getting too active
3. Consider the pawn structure on the a-file

Looking at my options, I want to maintain a strong king position. Moving to e5 keeps my king centralized and active, controlling important central squares while staying flexible for future play.

I can see this is an endgame position with very few pieces remaining:
- White King on b3
- White pawn on a5
- Black King on e5
- Black pawn on a6

This appears to be a king and pawn endgame. Let me check what legal moves are available to me as Black.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Looking at this king and pawn endgame, I need to analyze the position carefully:

- White has a pawn on a5 and king on b3
- Black has a pawn on a6 and king on e5
- White's pawn is blocked by my pawn on a6

The key strategic considerations are:
1. White's king is trying to support the a-pawn or potentially create threats
2. My king is centralized on e5, which is generally good
3. I need to either blockade White's pawn advance or create counterplay

Since White's a-pawn is blocked by my a6 pawn, the main question is king activity. My king is well-placed in the center. I should maintain good king positioning while keeping an eye on the pawn endgame.

The move Kf4 (e5f4) looks attractive as it:
- Keeps my king active and centralized
- Maintains flexibility to respond to White's king movements
- Doesn't commit to any particular side of the board prematurely

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Looking at this king and pawn endgame, I need to analyze the position carefully. The white pawn on a5 is blocked by my pawn on a6, so the key is king activity and creating winning chances.

My king on f4 is well-centralized. White's king on c4 is also active but focused on the queenside. I need to consider:

1. Whether to advance my king to support my pawn or create counterplay
2. The principle of opposition and key squares
3. Creating threats that White must respond to

The most principled move here is to advance my king toward the center and maintain maximum activity. Moving to e5 centralizes my king, keeps it active, and maintains flexibility for both supporting my a-pawn and creating counterplay.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Looking at this king and pawn endgame, I need to analyze the position carefully. White has a pawn on a5 and my pawn is on a6, blocking it. The key is to use my king actively.

My king is currently on e5 and White's king is on d3. In king and pawn endgames, king activity is crucial. I need to either:
1. Support my pawn or create counterplay
2. Try to stop White's pawn advancement
3. Create winning chances with my king

Since White's pawn is blocked by mine on the a-file, I should focus on king activity. Moving my king closer to the center or toward White's king could be beneficial.

Looking at my options:
- e5f6, e5e6, e5d6 move toward the 6th rank
- e5f5, e5d5, e5f4 move toward White's position

I think the most active move is to advance my king and put pressure on White's position.

The key strategic considerations are:
1. My king is much more active than White's king
2. The a-pawns are locked, so the outcome depends on king activity
3. I should try to improve my king position while White's king is poorly placed

Since White's king is on f1, I want to advance my king to gain space and potentially create threats. The move e4e5 advances my king toward the center and gives me more control over key squares.

1. The white pawn on a5 is blocked by my pawn on a6
2. I need to either create counterplay with my king or try to win White's pawn
3. My king is currently more active than White's king

Since the white king is far away on f2, I should try to use my king actively. The most logical plan is to advance my king toward White's position to create threats.

I see there's a discrepancy - the board shows the black king on f3, but the legal moves suggest it's on f4. Based on the UCI moves provided, my king must be on f4.

This is a critical king and pawn endgame. With White having a pawn on a5 and Black having a pawn on a6, the key is to use my king actively.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

I can see this is an endgame position with:
- White King on g2
- Black King on e3
- White pawn on a5
- Black pawn on a6

This appears to be a king and pawn endgame. Let me check what legal moves are available to me.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Looking at this position, I can see it's a critical king and pawn endgame. The white pawn on a5 is blocked by my pawn on a6, so the key is king activity and positioning.

My king is currently very actively placed on e3, and I have several good options. Let me analyze:

- The white king on g2 is relatively passive
- I want to improve my king's position and potentially create threats
- Moving towards the center or towards white's king could be beneficial

I'll play Ke4, advancing my king to a more centralized and active square, putting pressure on white and maintaining good control of the center.

I can see White has played Nf3, which is a solid opening move. As Black, I have several good options. I'll play a classical response that develops a piece and fights for the center.

make_move g8f6

This develops my knight to f6, which:
- Develops a piece toward the center
- Controls important central squares (e4 and d5)
- Prepares for future development
- Is a principled response to White's knight development

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Looking at the position, I can see that White has played an early Nh4, which is not a very strong developing move. This knight on h4 is somewhat out of play and could become a target.

I have several good options, but I think the most principled move here is to develop my queenside knight and control the center.

make_move b8c6

This move:
1. Develops a piece toward the center
2. Controls important central squares (d4, e5)
3. Follows good opening principles
4. Keeps my options open for future development

I can see that White has played an unusual opening with a knight to h4, which is not a principled move. As Black, I want to develop my pieces actively and take advantage of White's poor knight placement.

Looking at my options, I'll develop my knight from f6 to e4, which:
1. Centralizes my knight on an excellent square
2. Attacks White's poorly placed knight on h4 (indirectly putting pressure)
3. Controls important central squares
4. Follows good opening principles of rapid development

- Most other pieces are still in their starting positions

Let me check what legal moves are available for Black.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Now I can see all the available moves. Looking at the position, I have two knights actively placed on c6 and e4, which gives me good tactical opportunities.

Let me analyze the key candidate moves:

1. **Nxd4** (c6d4) - Captures White's knight on d4, winning material
2. **Nf2+** (e4f2) - Knight fork, giving check to the king and likely winning material
3. **Ng3** (e4g3) - Attacks the rook on h1
4. **Nc3** (e4c3) - Centralizes the knight

The most forcing move appears to be Nf2+, which gives check and creates a fork. This will force White's king to move and I should be able to capture material on the next move.

- White has a knight on g4 and h3
- Black has knights on c6 and f2 (the f2 knight is in an advanced position)
- White's king is still on e1 and hasn't castled
- Black has a knight fork opportunity with the knight on f2

Excellent! I can see several strong tactical options. The knight on f2 is in a very powerful position. Let me analyze the key candidate moves:

1. **f2d1+** - This gives check and forks the king and queen! This looks like a winning tactical shot.
2. **f2h1** - Attacks the rook in the corner
3. **f2g4** - Captures the knight on g4
4. **f2h3** - Captures the knight on h3

The move f2d1+ is clearly the strongest as it's a royal fork - checking the king while simultaneously attacking the queen. White will be forced to move the king, and then I can capture the queen with Nxd1.

I can see my available moves. I notice I have a knight on d1 that's very deep in White's position, and another knight on c6. The knight on d1 is in an excellent position to cause damage.

Looking at the knight on d1, I can move it to several squares. The move d1e3 looks particularly strong as it would fork the king on e1 and potentially attack other pieces. Let me examine this more carefully - with the knight on e3, it would be attacking the king and likely winning material.

I notice I have a knight on c6 and another knight that appears to be on f1 (which seems unusual - it might have been captured and promoted, or there's some tactical sequence that led to this position).

Let me check what legal moves are available to me as Black.

Now I can see my available moves. Looking at the position, I have:
- A knight on c6 with several good squares available
- A knight on f1 (which is quite active on White's back rank)
- Various pawn moves

The knight on f1 is in a very interesting position deep in White's territory. Let me analyze the key options:

1. **f1e3** - Centralizes the knight and attacks important squares
2. **f1g3** - Moves toward the kingside, potentially supporting an attack
3. **c6e5** - Centralizes the other knight to a strong outpost
4. **c6d4** - Another strong central square for the knight

Given that I have a knight on f1 (White's back rank), this is a very advantageous position. The move **f1e3** looks particularly strong as it:
- Centralizes the knight
- Controls key squares like d5 and f5
- Maintains pressure on White's position
- Keeps the knight active and well-placed

1. The knight on d1 can move to several squares: e3, c3, f2, or b2
2. The knight on c6 has various options including e5, d4, a5, b4
3. I also have pawn moves available

The knight on d1 is in an excellent position to cause disruption. The move Nf2+ looks very appealing as it would be a fork, checking the king on e1 and potentially attacking other pieces.

Wait, let me double-check the king's position from the board... I see the white king is on e1, so Nf2 would indeed be check.

Now I can see my available moves. Looking at the position, I notice I have a very advanced knight on f2 that's deep in White's territory. This knight is in a powerful position and can create serious threats.

Let me analyze the key candidate moves:

1. **f2d1** - This would be a devastating knight fork, attacking both the king on e1 and potentially other pieces
2. **f2h1** - Attacks the rook in the corner
3. **f2d3** - Centralizes the knight and maintains pressure
4. **f2e4** - Good central square
5. **c6d4** - Advances the other knight to a strong outpost

The knight on f2 is perfectly placed to deliver a fork. Looking at f2d1, this move would put the knight on d1 where it would give check to the White king on e1, and this appears to be a royal fork that could win material.

I can see the current position. Let me analyze what's happening:

- White has a pawn on c6 (quite advanced)
- White has a knight on d1 (seems to be retreated or developed unusually)
- White's king is on e1 (hasn't castled yet)
- I have a pawn on d5 in the center
- My pieces are mostly on their starting squares except for missing knights on b8 and g8

Let me check what legal moves are available to me.

I can see the available moves. Looking at the position, I notice that White has a pawn on c6 which is quite advanced and could become dangerous. I also see that White has a knight on d1 that seems out of play.

Let me make a developing move that improves my position. I'll develop my light-squared bishop to put pressure on White's position.

make_move c8e6

This move:
1. Develops my light-squared bishop to an active square
2. Controls important central squares
3. Prepares potential castling
4. Puts the bishop on a good diagonal where it can be useful for both attack and defense

- White's king appears to be on e1 (uncastled)
- There are some tactical possibilities to explore

Let me check what legal moves are available to me.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

I notice something unusual in the move list - there are knight moves from d1 (d1e3, d1c3, d1f2, d1b2), but d1 should be a white square where a white piece would be. Let me analyze the position more carefully.

Looking at the board, I can see:
- My king is on e8 (uncastled)
- My queen is on d8
- I have rooks on a8 and h8
- My bishop is actively placed on e6
- There's a white pawn advanced to c6

Given the position, I should look for active moves. The bishop on e6 is well-placed, and I notice I can potentially create some pressure. Let me consider my options:

1. Moving the queen to create threats
2. Developing my rooks
3. Using my bishop actively

I think I'll move my queen to a more active square. Qd7 looks good as it connects my rooks and prepares potential castling queenside.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

I can see this is an interesting middlegame position. Let me analyze the key features:

- White has developed pieces but the king is still in the center on e1
- Black's king is also uncastled on e8
- Black has a queen on d7 and bishops on f6 and e6
- White has a bishop on g5 and rooks that appear active

Looking at the legal moves, I notice several interesting options:
1. Castling queenside (e8c8) to get my king to safety
2. Moving the queen (d7d8, d7c8, d7d6, d7c6) 
3. Bishop moves with the light-squared bishop (e6f5, e6g4)
4. The knight on d1 has several squares available

Given that both kings are uncastled, king safety should be a priority. Castling queenside (e8c8) would put my king in a safer position while connecting my rooks.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Looking at the position, I can see that White has made some aggressive moves with pieces like the bishop on g5 and rooks on a4 and h2. Let me analyze the key features:

1. My king is on c8, which seems relatively safe for now
2. White has a bishop on g5 that could be putting pressure on my position
3. I have a queen on d7 and rooks on d8 and h8
4. There's a knight on d1 that appears to be well-placed

I notice that my queen on d7 has several options, and I should look for active moves. The move d7e8 would put my queen on the back rank, potentially coordinating with my rooks. However, let me consider d7c6, which would centralize my queen and potentially support my b7 pawn advance.

Actually, looking more carefully, I think b7c6 could be a strong move, advancing my pawn and gaining space in the center while potentially supporting further pawn advances.

- Keep the knight active and well-placed
- Potentially fork or create threats
- Maintain pressure in White's position

1. My king on c8 needs safety
2. I have a knight on e3 that's well-placed and active
3. White's rook on d4 is centralized
4. I should look for tactical opportunities with my active pieces

The knight on e3 is in an excellent outpost position and I have several good options with it. Let me make a move that increases pressure and improves my position:

make_move e3c2

This knight move forks the king on e1 and attacks other pieces, creating immediate tactical threats while improving my piece coordination.

Looking at this position, I can see that White has a rook on d4 that appears to be quite active. I have a knight on c2 that's in a strong outpost position, and I notice some tactical possibilities.

Let me analyze the key features:
- My knight on c2 is very well placed
- White's king is on d1, which looks somewhat exposed
- I have a pawn on d5 that could potentially advance

The knight on c2 has several interesting options. Let me look for the most forcing move that creates immediate threats.

make_move c2e3

This knight move to e3 creates a fork, attacking both the white king on d1 and potentially other pieces, while maintaining a strong central position for my knight.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Looking at the position, I can see that White has their king on d1 and rooks on e4 and h2. My king is on c8, queen on d7, and I have bishops on f8 and e6. 

This appears to be an endgame position where I need to be careful about king safety while looking for active play. Let me analyze the key candidate moves:

1. **d7e8** - This moves my queen to e8, which could be preparing to coordinate with my rooks or control important central squares.

2. **e6f5** - This advances my bishop to a more active square, potentially putting pressure on White's position.

3. **c8b7** - This moves my king to relative safety on b7.

4. **d5d4** - This pawn advance could be strong, pushing into White's position.

Given that my king on c8 looks somewhat exposed and White has active rooks, I think the most prudent move is to improve my king safety first.

Let me analyze this position. I can see that White has a rook on e4 and another rook on e2, with the White king on d1. My king is on b7, which seems quite active but potentially exposed.

Looking at the position, I notice that White's king appears to be in a vulnerable position on d1. Let me check if I can create threats or improve my position.

I see that my queen on d7 has several options, and my rook on d8 can move along the back rank. The move that catches my attention is using my queen to create pressure.

make_move d7d6

This move:
1. Centralizes my queen on a strong square
2. Keeps pressure on White's position
3. Maintains flexibility for my pieces
4. Potentially prepares further tactical opportunities

The move **d6e5** looks very strong as it:
- Centralizes my queen even more
- Puts pressure on White's position
- Controls key central squares
- Potentially sets up tactical threats

2. White's king on d1 looks vulnerable 
3. I have bishops on e6 and f6 that can support an attack
4. White's pieces seem somewhat uncoordinated

I notice that my queen on e5 has several powerful options. Let me look for the most forcing move.

The move **e5e4** catches my attention - this advances the queen with tempo, potentially threatening White's position and maintaining central control.

However, I also see **e5d4** which attacks toward the center and keeps maximum pressure.

But wait - looking more carefully at the position, I see that **e5e4** appears to give check or create serious threats against the exposed white king.

Looking at this position, I can see that White has a queen on e2 that's quite active and centralized. I need to assess the tactical situation carefully.

Let me analyze the key features:
- My king is on b7, somewhat exposed
- White's queen on e2 is very active
- I have rooks on d8 and h8
- My bishops are on f6 and e6

I notice that White's king on c1 looks vulnerable, and my rook on d8 is on the same file. Let me look for tactical opportunities.

The move that stands out to me is **d8d1+** - this would be a check, forcing the White king to move and potentially winning material or achieving a strong position.

Wait, let me double-check this move is in my legal moves list... I see d8d7, d8d6 but not d8d1. Let me reconsider.

Looking at the position more carefully, I should focus on improving my piece coordination and king safety. The move **e6d7** looks good as it:
1. Develops my bishop to a more active square
2. Supports my rook on d8
3. Prepares potential tactical ideas

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Let me analyze this position. I can see that:

1. My king is on b7, which seems quite active
2. I have rooks on d8 and h8
3. I have bishops on f8 and d7
4. White has a queen on e2 that's very centralized and active
5. White's king appears to be on c1

The white queen on e2 is in a very strong position, controlling many squares. I need to either challenge it or improve my piece coordination.

Looking at my options, I notice that my bishop on d7 has several good squares available. The move d7e6 would centralize my bishop and potentially prepare to challenge White's central control.

However, I also see that d7c8 could be useful to get my bishop to a safer square and potentially prepare b7-b8 to activate my rook.

Let me make a move that improves my position:

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Looking at this position, I can see that White has just played their queen to e2, which is putting pressure on my position. The white queen on e2 is quite centralized and active.

Let me analyze the key features:
- My king is on b7, somewhat exposed
- I have rooks on d8 and h8
- My bishops are on f8 and e6
- White's queen on e2 is very active
- White has a bishop on a5 and rooks that could become dangerous

I need to improve my position while dealing with the pressure from White's queen. Let me consider moving my rook from d8 to create some counterplay or improve my piece coordination.

The move d8d7 looks interesting as it:
1. Moves the rook to a more active square
2. Potentially prepares to double rooks or create threats
3. Keeps my pieces coordinated

I see that I can play e2d1+ which would be check, forcing the White king to move. This looks like a very strong move as it gives check and maintains pressure.

3. White has a rook on f4 and their king on c2
4. I have a bishop on g4 that's actively placed
5. There's a white bishop on a5

Let me analyze some key candidate moves:

- My bishop on g4 is well-placed and has several good squares
- I could move my rook from d7 to create threats
- My king needs to find safety

The move **g4e2** looks very strong - it would put my bishop on e2, giving a check to the white king on c2 and forcing it to move. This creates immediate tactical pressure.

- I have rooks on d7 and h8
- I have bishops on f8 and e2
- I have pawns on a7, c6, d5, e7, f7, g7, h7

The white king appears to be on c2, and there are white pieces including a bishop on a5, rook on h4, knight on b1, and pawns.

I notice that my bishop on e2 has many good squares available. Looking at the position more carefully, I can see that my bishop on e2 can move to several strong squares. 

One particularly attractive move is to play the bishop to a6, which would put pressure on White's position and potentially create threats.

Let me analyze this position. I can see that:

1. My king is on b7 and appears to be in a somewhat exposed position
2. I have rooks on h8 and d7
3. I have a bishop on a6 that has several good diagonal moves available
4. White has their king on c2 and some pieces that could be creating threats

Looking at the legal moves, I notice several interesting options:

- The bishop on a6 can move to several squares including e2, which would give check to the white king on c2
- I can also move my rooks to potentially better positions
- Several pawn moves are available

Let me play the most forcing move - giving check with my bishop:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Let me analyze this position. I can see that:

1. My king is on b7 and appears to be somewhat active
2. I have a rook on d7 and another on h8
3. White has a rook on h5 and their king on c2
4. I have a bishop on e2 that seems well-placed
5. White has some pieces on the back rank

Looking at the legal moves, I notice several interesting options:

- My rook on d7 can move to d8, d6, or along the 7th rank
- My king on b7 has several squares available
- My bishop on e2 has many diagonal moves available
- I can advance various pawns

Let me look for the most forcing or advantageous move. The bishop on e2 is very active and can create threats. I notice I can play e2d1, which would put my bishop on a strong diagonal, or e2h5 to challenge White's rook.

However, I think the most promising move is to advance my d-pawn with d5d4, creating central pressure and potentially opening lines for my pieces.

3. There's a bishop on f8
4. White has their king on c2 with some pieces around

Looking at the available moves, I notice I have several options with my rook on d7. The move d7d8 would put my rook on the back rank, which could be powerful. Let me also consider d7d5 or d7d6 for more central control.

However, I'm particularly interested in d7d5, as it:
- Centralizes my rook
- Potentially creates threats against White's position
- Gives me more active piece play

Looking at the position, I can see:

- My king is on b7 in a somewhat exposed position
- I have a rook on d5 that's actively placed
- I have another rook on h8
- White has their king on b3 and some pieces that could be threatening

Let me analyze the key candidate moves:

1. **b7c8** - Moving my king to safety on the back rank
2. **d5d3+** - This would be a check, forcing the white king to move
3. **d5b5+** - Another check option
4. **d5a5** - Attacking the a4 pawn

The most forcing move appears to be **d5d3+**, which gives check and puts pressure on White's position. This forces White's king to move and maintains the initiative.

I see the issue now. Looking at the legal moves list, I can see that **d4d3** is available, not d5d3. There must be a black pawn on d4, not a rook on d5 as I initially thought.

The move **d4d3** would advance my pawn and likely put pressure on White's position, potentially threatening the white king on b3.

- My rook on h8 can potentially swing into the game
- White has a rook on b4 and knights on a3 and e3

I notice that I can play **b5b4+**, which would be a check, forcing the White king to move and potentially winning the White rook on b4.

Looking at this position, I can see that:

1. My king is on b7 and appears to be in a somewhat exposed position
2. I have a rook on h8 and a bishop on f8
3. White has their king on b3 with some pieces nearby
4. There's a black pawn on d3 that's quite advanced

Let me analyze the key candidate moves:

- **d3e2** - This pushes my advanced pawn even further, potentially creating serious threats
- **d3d2** - Also advances the dangerous pawn
- **b7c8, b7b8, b7a8** - King moves to the back rank for safety
- **h8g8** - Rook move, possibly preparing to support the center

The pawn on d3 is very advanced and creating real threats. Pushing it to e2 with **d3e2** looks very strong as it:
1. Advances closer to promotion
2. Attacks potential squares around the white king
3. Creates immediate tactical threats

Looking at the position, I can see that:

1. I have a black king on b7
2. I have a black rook on h8
3. I have a black bishop on f8
4. I have several pawns
5. Most importantly, I have a pawn on e2 that can promote!

The pawn on e2 can promote to any piece. Given the position, promoting to a queen would give me the most powerful piece and significant material advantage.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Looking at this position, I can see that Black has a queen on e1 in a very active position deep in White's territory, along with a rook on h8 and bishop on f8. The White king appears to be on c2 in a somewhat exposed position.

Let me analyze the key candidate moves:

1. **e1e2+** - This would be check, forcing the White king to move
2. **e1c3+** - Another check option
3. **e1d2+** - Also gives check
4. **e1b1** - Attacks along the back rank
5. **e1f2** - Maintains central control

The checks look very promising since the White king appears vulnerable. Let me go with the most forcing move:

2. I have a queen on e2 which is very actively placed

4. I have a rook on h8 and bishop on f8

With my queen so actively placed on e2 and White's king exposed on c3, I should look for forcing moves. Let me examine the queen moves more carefully.

The move e2e3+ would give check to the White king on c3, forcing it to move and potentially allowing me to gain tempo or create further threats.

My queen on e3 is very actively placed and has many options. Let me look for the most forcing move.

I notice that my queen can give check to the white king on b2. The move Qe3-e2+ would be a strong check, forcing the white king to move and maintaining pressure.

Since I have multiple ways to give check, let me choose the most forcing one. Moving the queen to b2 gives check and attacks along the second rank.

4. White's king is on b2

Let me analyze the key candidate moves:

- **b7c8**: Moving my king to c8 would improve its safety by getting it to the back rank
- **h8g8**: Moving the rook to g8 could be useful for defense or counterplay
- **c6c5**: Advancing this pawn could challenge White's central control

Given that king safety is paramount, especially in what appears to be an endgame position, I think moving my king to a safer square is the priority.

- I have a rook on h8, bishop on f8, and several pawns
- White has a king on b7, bishop on b4, knight on e4, and pawns on a5 and h3
- This appears to be an endgame position

The white king on b7 is quite active and close to my position. I need to be careful about king safety while looking for counterplay opportunities.

Let me consider my options:
1. King moves (c8d8, c8b8, c8b7) - but c8b7 would put my king next to the white king
2. Rook moves (h8g8) - could improve rook activity
3. Pawn moves - various pawn advances available

I think moving my rook to a more active square would be good. The rook on g8 would give it more central influence and potential to create threats.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Looking at this position, I can see:

- My king is on c8 and appears to be in some danger with White's bishop on b4
- White has a knight on f6 which is quite active
- White's king is on b2
- I have a rook on g8 and bishop on f8

Let me analyze the key candidate moves:

1. **c8d7** - Moves my king to a more central square, getting away from the back rank
2. **c8b7** - Moves king toward White's king but might be more exposed
3. **g8h8** - Moves rook but doesn't seem to accomplish much
4. Pawn moves like **e7e5**, **g7g5** - Could help with space and development

The most logical move appears to be **c8d7**, centralizing my king and improving its safety while maintaining flexibility for my other pieces.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Looking at this position, I can see:

- My king is on d7 in a somewhat exposed position
- I have a rook on g8 and bishop on f8
- White has a king on b8, bishop on b4, and pawns on a5 and h3
- This appears to be an endgame position

Let me analyze the key candidate moves:

1. **Kd7-e8** or **Kd7-c8**: These moves get my king to the back rank, potentially safer
2. **Kd7-e6**: This centralizes my king, which is often good in endgames
3. **Rg8-h8**: This move gets my rook off the g-file

Given that this is an endgame, king activity is crucial. Moving to e6 centralizes my king and keeps it active, while the back rank moves (e8, c8) might be too passive. The centralized king on e6 would be well-placed to support my pawns or counter White's plans.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Looking at this position, I can see:

- My king is on e6 in a somewhat exposed position
- White has a king on b1 and a bishop on d2
- White has a knight on f6 which is quite active and close to my king
- I have a rook on g8 and bishop on f8, plus several pawns

The white knight on f6 is putting pressure on my position. Let me analyze my key options:

1. **g8h8** - Move my rook to the corner, but this seems passive
2. **e6f7** - Move my king forward, but this gets closer to the white knight
3. **e6d7** - Move my king away from the knight's influence
4. **e6f5** - Advance the king, but again closer to the knight
5. **e6d5** - Centralize my king

Given that the white knight on f6 is actively placed and my king needs safety, I think moving the king to d5 would centralize it while getting away from immediate knight threats. This also activates my king for the endgame.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Looking at this position, I can see:

- My king is on d5 in a very active, centralized position
- White has a king on b1, bishop on d2, knight on e5, and pawns on a5 and h3
- I have a rook on g8, bishop on f8, and several pawns

The white knight on e5 is quite strong and centralized. I should consider how to deal with it. Let me analyze my king moves:

- Kd5-e6 would be very aggressive, advancing further up the board
- Kd5-e4 keeps the king active and central
- Kd5-d4 also maintains central control

Given that my king is already very well-placed and active, I think advancing it even further with Ke6 would put maximum pressure on White's position and potentially support my pawns' advance.

Looking at this endgame position, I can see:

- I have a king on e6, a rook on g8, and several pawns
- White has a king on b8, a bishop on d2, a knight on d7, and two pawns
- This appears to be a complex endgame where piece activity and pawn advancement will be crucial

Let me analyze the key candidate moves:

1. **g8h8** - Moves the rook to the back rank corner
2. **e6f7** - Advances the king toward White's pieces
3. **e6d6** - King move toward the center
4. **g7g6** or **g7g5** - Pawn advances on the kingside
5. **c6c5** - Central pawn advance

The most principled move appears to be advancing my king to support my pawns and create threats. Moving to f7 puts pressure on White's position and supports potential pawn advances.

Looking at this endgame position, I can see:

- White King on b1
- White Bishop on c3  
- White pawns on a5 and h3
- Black King on f6
- Black Bishop on f8
- Black Rook on g8
- Black pawns on a7, c6, e7, f7, g7, h7

This appears to be a complex endgame where I need to be careful about White's passed a-pawn on a5. Let me analyze the key considerations:

1. White's a-pawn is quite advanced and could become dangerous
2. My rook and bishop give me good piece activity
3. I need to either create counterplay or stop White's pawn advance

Looking at my options, I think advancing my e-pawn to create central activity and potential counterplay is a good plan. This also opens up more space for my pieces.

2. **f8e7, f8d6, f8c5, f8b4, f8a3** - Bishop moves along the long diagonal
3. **f7e8** - This would be promoting a pawn to a queen (f7-e8), which looks very strong!
4. **c6c5, e5e4** - Pawn advances
5. **f7g6, f7e6** - King moves

Wait, looking more carefully at the notation, f7e8 suggests I have a pawn on f7 that can promote by capturing on e8. This would be an extremely powerful move, creating a new queen.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Looking at this endgame position, I can see:

- My king is on e8
- White has a king on a1, bishop on c3, and knight on f6
- I have a rook on g8 and bishop on f8
- This appears to be a difficult endgame for Black

Let me analyze my options:
- e8d8: Move king to d8
- e8f7: Move king to f7 
- e8e7: Move king to e7
- g7f6: This must be capturing the white knight on f6 with a piece from g7

Wait, let me reconsider the board. Looking more carefully, I think g7f6 means I can capture the white knight on f6. This would be an excellent tactical opportunity to win material.

- Black king on e8
- Black bishop on f8  
- Black rook on g8
- Several black pawns
- White king on a2
- White bishop on c3
- A few white pawns

This appears to be a winning endgame for Black with the extra material. I need to find the most forcing move to convert this advantage.

The white king looks very exposed on a2, and I have a powerful rook on g8. Let me look for the most direct way to create threats.

make_move g8g2

This move attacks the white king directly, forcing it to move and allowing me to dominate the second rank with my rook, which should lead to a quick win.

The black rook on g2 is in a very active position on the second rank. I can see several strong options:

1. The rook can capture along the second rank or move to g1 with check
2. The bishop has good mobility from f8
3. Pawn advances are possible

Let me play a move that improves my king position while maintaining pressure:

make_move e8d7

This centralizes my king, bringing it closer to the action and supporting my pawns, while my rook continues to dominate the first rank.

Wait, let me reconsider - that would be capturing the king which isn't legal if the king isn't actually on a1. Let me look more carefully at the position and choose a strong move that improves my position.

The rook on g1 is very active on the first rank. I should look for a move that either gives check or improves my piece coordination.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Looking at this endgame position, I can see:

- Black king on e6
- Black bishop on e7  
- Black rook on a1
- Black pawns on a7, c6, f6, h7
- White king on b2
- White bishop on e5
- White pawns on a5, h3

This appears to be a favorable endgame for Black with the extra rook. I need to look for ways to improve my position and create threats.

The white king looks somewhat exposed on b2, and I have several good options. Let me play a move that improves my rook's activity and puts pressure on White's position.

Black pieces:

- Rook on b1
- Bishop on e7
- Pawns on a7, c7, f6, h7

White pieces:
- King on c2
- Bishop on e5
- Pawns on a5, h3

This appears to be a rook and bishop vs bishop endgame with pawns. Let me check my legal moves to see the tactical possibilities.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

I notice there's a discrepancy - the legal moves list includes c6c5, but I don't see a pawn on c6 on the board (I see one on c7). Let me work with what I can see clearly.

Looking at this position, I have a material advantage with my rook against White's bishop. The key is to coordinate my pieces effectively. 

I notice a few interesting tactical possibilities:

1. My rook can attack along the first rank or the b-file
2. My bishop has good mobility on the long diagonal
3. The white king looks somewhat exposed on c2

Let me look for the most forcing move. I can capture the white bishop with my king or pawn, or I can look for tactical shots with my rook.

I see that I can play **fxe5**, capturing the white bishop with my f6 pawn, which would give me a winning material advantage.

Looking at this position, I have a significant material advantage with my rook and bishop against White's king and pawns. I need to find the most forcing continuation.

I notice White's king is somewhat exposed on c3, and I have a powerful rook on b1. Let me look for the most direct way to create threats.

The move **b1b3+** looks very strong - it gives check to the White king on c3, forcing it to move and allowing me to maintain pressure. This will disrupt White's coordination and give me tempo to improve my position further.

This appears to be an endgame position where I have a material advantage with rook and bishop versus just pawns. I should look for forcing moves to convert this advantage.

The white king on d1 looks vulnerable, and my rook on c3 is well-placed. Let me consider some key candidate moves:

1. `c3c1+` - This would be check, forcing the white king to move
2. `e6d5` or `e6f5` - Centralizing my king
3. `e4e3` - Advancing my passed pawn

- White has pawns on a5 and h3

This appears to be an endgame position. Let me analyze the key candidate moves:

1. **e4e3** - Advancing my passed pawn toward promotion
2. **c1c2+** - Giving check to the White king
3. **e6f5** or **e6d5** - Activating my king

The most forcing move appears to be pushing my passed e-pawn. In endgames, passed pawns should generally be pushed, especially when they're close to promotion.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Looking at this endgame position, I can see:

- Black king on e6
- Black bishop on e7  
- Black rook on c1
- Black pawns on a7, c6, h7, and e3
- White king on d3
- White pawns on a6 and h3

This appears to be a winning endgame for Black. The key factors are:
1. The advanced e3 pawn is very dangerous
2. The rook on c1 is actively placed
3. The white king is somewhat exposed

The most forcing move is to advance the passed e-pawn, which will create immediate threats and force White's king to deal with it.

I can see this is an endgame position. Let me analyze what's on the board:

Black pieces:
- King on e6
- Bishop on e7
- Rook on f3
- Pawns on a7, c7, c5, h7

White pieces:
- King on c4
- Pawns on a6, h4

This looks like a winning endgame for Black with the extra material. Let me check my legal moves to find the best continuation.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Looking at this position, I have a significant material advantage with my rook and bishop against White's king and pawns. The White king on c4 is quite active, so I need to be careful.

Let me analyze the key candidate moves:

1. **f3f4+** - This gives check and forces the White king to move, potentially disrupting White's coordination
2. **f3c3+** - Another check that attacks the king from the side
3. **e6d5** - Centralizing my king to support the advance of my c5 pawn
4. **c7c6** - Advancing the passed pawn

I think the most forcing move is to give check and improve my rook's position:

- Black King on e6  
- Black Bishop on e7
- Black Rook on f4
- Black pawns on a7, c7, h7, and c5
- White pawns on a6 and h4

This appears to be a winning endgame for Black with the extra material (rook and bishop vs just pawns). I need to look for the most forcing move.

The White king looks somewhat exposed on b5, and I have a powerful rook on f4. Let me look for a move that creates immediate threats.

I notice that the move **f4b4+** would give check to the White king, forcing it to move and allowing me to maintain pressure.

I can see this is an endgame position where I have:

- Black rook on b4  
- Black bishop on e7
- Black pawns on a7, c7, h7, and c5

White has:
- White king on c6
- White pawns on a6 and h4

This looks like a winning endgame for Black. Let me look for the most forcing move. I notice that my rook on b4 has many options, and my bishop on e7 can also move to several squares.

The white king on c6 is quite active, so I should look for moves that either create threats or improve my piece coordination. 

Let me play a move that puts pressure on White's position:

make_move b4c4

This move attacks the white king and forces it to move, while keeping my rook active on the 4th rank where it can control important squares.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Looking at this position, I can see that White has a dangerous passed pawn on a6 that's very close to promoting. My priority should be to deal with this threat while maintaining my material advantage.

The White king on c7 is supporting the a6 pawn's advance. I need to either blockade the pawn or create counterplay. Let me consider my options:

1. I could capture the h4 pawn with my bishop (e7h4) or rook (c4h4)
2. I could use my rook to attack from the side or rear
3. I could improve my king position

The most forcing move appears to be capturing the h4 pawn with my rook, which eliminates White's second passed pawn and gives me a clean extra material advantage.

Looking at this position, I have a significant material advantage and need to find the most efficient way to convert this win. The white king on b7 is actively placed near my a7 pawn, so I should address this threat while improving my position.

I notice that my rook on h4 is quite active and can create immediate threats. Let me play a move that puts pressure on White's position while maintaining my winning advantage.

make_move h4b4

This move:
1. Attacks the white king on b7, forcing it to move
2. Controls the important b-file 
3. Supports my a7 pawn indirectly by limiting the white king's mobility
4. Maintains pressure while keeping all my pieces coordinated

This should help me convert my material advantage efficiently.

Looking at this position, I have a significant material advantage with a rook and bishop against just a pawn. The white king is trapped on a7, and I need to coordinate my pieces to deliver checkmate.

The most forcing move here is to give check with my rook, which will drive the white king into an even more constrained position.

make_move b4b7

This move gives check to the white king on a7. The king will be forced to move to a8 (the only legal square), after which I can continue to coordinate my pieces for a quick checkmate. With the king trapped on the back rank, I'll be able to use my bishop and rook together to deliver mate efficiently.

This appears to be a critical endgame where I need to coordinate my king and bishop effectively. The white king is quite active on b7, and I need to prevent the a6 pawn from promoting while potentially creating counterplay with my c5 pawn.

Let me analyze the key candidate moves:

1. Moving my king closer to stop the a-pawn (like Kd7 or Kd6)
2. Advancing my own pawn with c5-c4
3. Repositioning my bishop to a better square

Given that the white king is already well-placed to support the a-pawn's advance, I think pushing my own passed pawn is the most forcing continuation.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Looking at this endgame position, I need to analyze the key factors:

1. Material: I have a bishop and two pawns vs White's one pawn
2. The white pawn on a6 is quite advanced and could become dangerous
3. My c4 pawn is also advanced and could be a winning asset
4. King activity will be crucial

The most critical decision is whether to push my c-pawn or focus on stopping White's a-pawn. Let me consider the key candidate moves:

- **c4c3**: Advancing my passed pawn closer to promotion
- **e6d5** or **e6f5**: Improving king position to support the c-pawn or stop the a-pawn
- Bishop moves to control key squares

Given that my c-pawn is currently more advanced than White's a-pawn, and I have the additional material advantage with my bishop, I should push for the win by advancing my passed pawn.

Excellent! I can see that my pawn on c2 can promote to a queen, which would be winning. The move c2c1q promotes my pawn to a queen, giving me a decisive material advantage.

With a queen against just a king and pawn, I should easily be able to win this endgame.

I'll play the queen to a3, which:

2. Controls important squares around the white king
3. Coordinates well with my other pieces

I can see this is an endgame position with:
- White King on c6
- Black King on e6  
- Black Bishop on e7
- Black pawn on h5

This appears to be a King and Bishop + pawn vs King endgame. Let me check what legal moves are available to me.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Looking at this position, I have a King + Bishop + pawn vs King endgame. The key is to coordinate my pieces effectively. 

My main plan should be to:
1. Push my h-pawn toward promotion
2. Use my king and bishop to support the pawn's advance
3. Keep the white king at bay

The h-pawn is currently on h5 and can advance to h4. My king on e6 is well-placed but could move closer to support the pawn. My bishop on e7 has many squares available.

I think the most direct approach is to advance my pawn immediately while I have good piece coordination.

Looking at this endgame position, I have a king, bishop, and pawn against a lone white king. This should be a winning position for Black.

The key strategic elements I see:
1. My h-pawn is advanced and could become dangerous
2. I need to coordinate my pieces to either promote the pawn or create mating threats
3. The white king on b7 is somewhat out of play

Let me advance my h-pawn to create immediate threats:

The White King on a8 is far from my h3 pawn, so I should push it forward immediately. The pawn is only two moves away from promotion.

Looking at this position, I have a significant material advantage with my queen and bishop against just the white king. The white king is somewhat trapped on a6, and I need to coordinate my pieces to deliver checkmate.

Let me analyze the key candidate moves:

1. I could use my queen to control key squares and limit the white king's mobility
2. My bishop can support the attack from the long diagonal
3. My king should advance to help with the mating attack

The move **b1a1** looks very strong here because:
- It puts my queen on the back rank, controlling the entire first rank
- It severely limits the white king's escape squares
- It prepares to coordinate with my other pieces for a mating attack

This move forces the white king into an even more constrained position and brings me closer to checkmate.

I can see this is an endgame position with:
- Black: Queen on a5, Bishop on e7, King on e6
- White: King on c4

This looks like a winning endgame for Black. Let me check what legal moves are available.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

I can see I have many options with my queen, bishop, and king. In this endgame position, I need to coordinate my pieces to deliver checkmate. The white king on c4 is somewhat centralized, so I should look for forcing moves.

Let me analyze the position:
- My king on e6 and bishop on e7 are well-placed
- The white king on c4 needs to be driven to the edge
- I should look for checks or moves that restrict the white king's mobility

I'll play a queen move that gives check and forces the white king toward the edge of the board.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Looking at this position, I have a winning material advantage with queen and bishop versus just the white king. I need to be methodical and look for the most forcing moves.

I notice that I can give check with my queen, which will force the white king to move and help me coordinate my pieces for a mating attack.

The move Qc3+ looks very strong as it:
1. Gives check to the white king on d3
2. Forces the king to move to a worse square
3. Centralizes my queen
4. Maintains control of key squares

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

I notice there's an error in the legal moves list - it includes White queen moves (c3 moves), but since it's Black's turn, I should only see Black's legal moves. Let me focus on the Black moves I can see:

Black king moves: e6f7, e6d7, e6f6, e6d6, e6f5, e6e5, e6d5
Black bishop moves: e7f8, e7d8, e7f6, e7d6, e7g5, e7c5, e7h4, e7b4, e7a3

In this queen vs bishop + king endgame, my position is very difficult. The White queen is centrally placed and can create threats from multiple directions. My main goals are:
1. Keep my king and bishop coordinated
2. Avoid immediate tactical threats
3. Try to reach a drawing fortress if possible

Looking at the position, I need to be careful about queen checks and forks. The move e6f6 looks natural, keeping my king active and maintaining coordination with the bishop.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Looking at this position, I have a significant material advantage with queen and bishop versus the lone white king. My goal is to deliver checkmate efficiently.

The white king on f2 is somewhat centralized, so I need to restrict its movement and drive it towards the edge of the board. Let me look for a move that cuts off escape squares and forces the king into a more confined position.

The move c3f3+ looks very strong here - it gives check and forces the white king to move, while my queen controls the important f-file and third rank.

2. Forces the king to move to h1 (the only escape square)
3. Continues to restrict the king's movement
4. Maintains control of key squares

I can see this is the opening position with White having made one move - a knight to h3 (Nh3). This is an unusual and not very strong opening move by White, as it places the knight on the rim where it's less effective.

Perfect! I have all the standard opening moves available. Since White played the unusual Nh3, I can respond with a strong, classical developing move.

I'll play e7e5, which:
1. Controls the center (d4 and f4 squares)
2. Opens lines for my bishop and queen
3. Follows sound opening principles
4. Takes advantage of White's weak first move

I can see the current position. White has made a few moves - there's a pawn on c4, a knight on h3, and it looks like the f1 bishop and g1 knight have moved. Black has advanced the e-pawn to e5. Let me check what legal moves are available to me.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

I can see this is an early opening position. White has played an English Opening setup with c4 and developed the knight to h3 (which is a bit unusual). Black has responded with e5.

Looking at the position and available moves, I want to develop my pieces actively. The most natural and strong moves here are:

1. Nf6 - developing the knight and attacking the e4 square
2. Nc6 - developing the queenside knight
3. Bb4+ - developing with check
4. d6 or d5 - controlling the center

I'll go with the classical development of the knight to f6, which puts pressure on the center and prepares further development.

Looking at the position, I can see that White has developed a knight to g5, which is attacking the f7 square - a common weak point in Black's position. I also notice that White has played c4, likely aiming for central control.

I should focus on solid development and addressing the pressure on f7. Let me develop my kingside knight to a good square.

This move:
1. Develops my knight to a central square
2. Attacks White's knight on g5, forcing it to move
3. Helps control important central squares
4. Relieves some pressure on my position

I can see the current position. White has developed a knight to g5, which is attacking my f7 square - a common weak point in Black's position. I also have a knight on e4 which is well-placed in the center.

Let me analyze the key features:
- White's knight on g5 is putting pressure on f7
- My knight on e4 is actively placed
- My king is still in the center and needs safety
- I should look for active moves that either defend or counterattack

Looking at my options, I can:
1. Move my knight from e4 to attack something
2. Defend f7 with moves like f8e7 or d8e7
3. Develop pieces while addressing the threats

I think the best move is to attack White's knight on g5 while developing my pieces. I'll play my knight from e4 to f6, which attacks the g5 knight and develops toward the kingside.

- My knight on f6 is actively placed
- I can develop my pieces or advance pawns

- White has a knight on e4 which is well-centralized
- My pawn on e5 is advanced and controls important central squares
- I have both knights still on the board (c6 and f6)
- White's king appears to still be in the center

Looking at the available moves, I notice several tactical possibilities. The move that stands out to me is **c6d4**, which would place my knight on a strong central outpost, forking the king on e1 and potentially creating threats.

However, let me also consider **f6e4**, which would exchange my knight for White's centralized knight, simplifying the position.

After analysis, I think the most principled move is to challenge White's central knight while improving my piece coordination.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

I can see this is an interesting middlegame position. Let me analyze what I see:

- White has developed pieces and has pawns on a4, c4, d4, e4, f4, g4, h4
- Black has two knights actively placed on c6 and e4
- Black's king is still on e8 (uncastled)
- White appears to have castled kingside (no king visible on e1, rook on h1)

The knight on e4 is very well-placed in the center. I should look for tactical opportunities or ways to improve my position. Let me consider a few key candidate moves:

1. **Nc6-d4** - Centralizing the knight and potentially forking pieces
2. **Ne4-f6** - Developing with tempo, attacking something
3. **Ne4-d6** - Solid central placement
4. **Castling** - But I don't see that option, likely because pieces are in the way

The move Nd4 looks very appealing as it centralizes the knight powerfully and could create tactical threats.

I can see the current position. It looks like we're in the middle game with both sides having developed pieces. I notice I have two knights on d4 and e4, which are well-centralized. Let me check what legal moves are available to me.

Looking at this position, I can see I have two very well-placed knights on d4 and e4 in the center. Let me analyze the key tactical opportunities:

The knight on e4 can move to f6, which would be a fork - attacking both the king on e8 and potentially other pieces. Let me examine this more carefully:

If I play Nf6+, this gives check to the black king on e8, and the knight would be attacking from f6. This is a classic knight fork pattern.

Looking at this position, I can see that White has developed some pieces and has a pawn on e4. I have two knights actively placed - one on f6 and another on d4, which is in a strong central outpost.

Let me analyze the key features:
- My knight on d4 is very well placed in the center
- White's king is still in the center on e1
- I should look for moves that either improve my position or create threats

The knight on d4 has several attractive options. Let me consider the move Nxe2+, which would be a fork, checking the white king and attacking other pieces.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Looking at this position, I can see that White has developed their queen to c2 and has a knight on e2. I have a knight on f6 and another on e2 (which appears to be a captured/displaced piece). 

Let me analyze the key features:
- White's king is still on e1 (uncastled)
- White has a queen on c2 and bishop on d2
- I have knights on f6 and e2
- My king is still on e8 (uncastled)

The knight on e2 is in a very strong position, giving me several tactical opportunities. Let me look for the most forcing move.

The knight on e2 can move to several squares, but Ng3 looks particularly interesting as it would fork the king and rook, or Nd4 which attacks the queen.

Actually, looking more carefully, Nd4 attacks the White queen on c2, which would be a strong move forcing the queen to move.

Let me analyze the key candidate moves:

1. **d4e2+** - This knight fork would check the White king on d1 and attack the queen on c2, winning material
2. **d4f3** - Attacks the queen, forcing it to move
3. **d4e6** or **d4c6** - Retreating the knight to safety while maintaining central influence

Wait, I need to look more carefully at the king position. The White king appears to be on d1, not castled yet. The knight on d4 can give a devastating fork!

I can see this is an interesting middlegame position. Let me analyze the key features:

- White has a queen on c2 and appears to be well-developed
- I have knights on f6 and e2 (the knight on e2 is in an advanced, strong position)
- White's king is on d1, which seems somewhat exposed
- I have a pawn on e5 that's advanced

The knight on e2 is particularly well-placed and can create threats. Let me look for the most forcing moves. The knight on e2 can move to several squares, and I notice it can go to d4, which would be a very strong central outpost, or to f4 which could also be aggressive.

However, I also notice that my knight on e2 can move to g3, which would fork the king and rook if the rook is on h1. Let me check this tactical opportunity.

Looking at the position more carefully, I believe the knight move to g3 could be very strong as it attacks multiple targets and creates immediate threats.

I can see this is an interesting middlegame position. Let me analyze the key features:

- White has developed their queen to d4 (a very active central square)
- I have two knights on f6 and g3, with the g3 knight being quite active
- White's king appears to be still in the center on d1
- I have a pawn on e5 that's advanced

The knight on g3 is in a very strong position and can create threats. Let me look for the most forcing moves. The knight on g3 can go to several squares, but I notice it can go to e2, which would be a fork attacking both the king on d1 and potentially other pieces.

However, let me also consider other tactical possibilities. The knight could go to e4, which is also a strong central square.

After careful consideration, I think the most forcing move is:

make_move g3e2

This move puts the knight on e2, giving check to the white king on d1 and forcing White to respond to the threat.

Excellent! I can see I have a knight on e2, which is in a very strong position. Looking at the available moves, I notice that the knight on e2 can capture the bishop on c3 with check (since the white king is on e1).

Let me make this tactical move:

make_move e2c3

This captures White's bishop and gives check to the king, forcing White to respond to the check while I win material.

Looking at this position, I can see that White has a very active queen on d4 in the center of the board, which is putting pressure on my position. I need to develop my pieces and challenge White's central control.

I notice I have two knights - one on f6 and one on c3. The knight on c3 is well-placed and has many options. Let me consider my strategic options:

1. I could develop my bishop from f8
2. I could improve my knight positions
3. I could advance pawns to challenge the center

The knight on f6 can move to several squares, and I'm particularly interested in Nd5, which would centralize the knight and challenge White's queen. This move would also potentially fork some pieces or create tactical opportunities.

Let me verify this move is in my legal moves list... Yes, I see "c3e2" which represents Ne2+.

Looking at this position, I can see some very strong tactical opportunities. The knight on e2 is in an excellent position, and I notice that White's king on e1 hasn't castled and looks vulnerable.

Let me examine the knight on e2's possibilities:
- e2g1 would be a fork, attacking both the king and potentially winning material
- e2g3 attacks the rook on h2
- e2c3, e2d4, e2f4 are other knight moves

The move e2g1 looks particularly strong as it's a knight fork that would check the white king on e1 and simultaneously attack the rook on h2. This would force the king to move and then I can capture the rook.

- I have knights on d5 and g1, with the knight on d5 being very well-placed in the center

1. The knight on d5 has many good squares (e7, f6, b6, f4, b4, e3, c3)
2. I can develop my bishop from f8
3. I have various pawn moves available

The knight on d5 is excellently placed, and I should look for ways to use it effectively. The move **d5f4** looks very attractive as it:
- Attacks the white queen on d4
- Moves to an advanced outpost
- Creates tactical threats

This position looks quite tactical. Let me analyze some key candidate moves:

1. The knight on e2 is in a powerful position and can give checks
2. My knight on g1 can also contribute to the attack
3. White's king looks vulnerable on e1

I'm particularly interested in the knight moves from e2. Let me play:

This centralizes my knight, attacks key squares, and keeps pressure on White's exposed king position while preparing potential tactical shots.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

I can see this is an interesting middlegame position. Let me analyze the key features:

- White has a queen on f6 and a rook on h7, creating some pressure
- I have a knight on f4 that's well-placed and active
- White's king is on e1, still uncastled
- I have a knight on g1 (which seems unusual - likely captured and replaced or promoted)

Looking at the position, I notice White has some attacking chances but my knight on f4 is very strong. Let me look for the most forcing moves.

The knight on f4 has several good options:
- f4e2+ would be check, forking the king
- f4g2 attacks the rook on h7
- f4e6 centralizes the knight

Let me play the forcing check:

make_move f4e2

Looking at my options, I notice I have some tactical possibilities with my knights. The knight on e2 can move to several strong squares, and I should prioritize king safety.

However, I see that my knight on e2 can move to f4, which would be a very strong central outpost, attacking the white queen on g3 and potentially creating tactical threats.

2. I have knights on f4 and g1, which are actively placed
3. White's king is on e1, still in the center
4. I have a passed pawn on e5

The knight on f4 is very well-placed and has several strong options. Let me look for the most forcing moves:

- The knight on f4 can go to several squares, including e6, d5, g6, h5, h3, d3, g2, e2
- The move f4e2 would be a fork, attacking both the king on e1 and potentially other pieces
- The move f4g2 would attack the rook on g2

Let me play the most forcing move:

make_move f4e2

This knight move gives check to the White king on e1 and also forks the rook on g2, winning material.

Let me make a strong developing move that puts pressure on White's position:

make_move e2f4

This move:
1. Develops my knight to an active central square
2. Attacks White's advanced pawn on e5 (wait, I see that's my pawn)
3. Controls important central squares
4. Prepares to potentially fork or create tactical threats

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Looking at this position, I can see that White has developed their pieces actively with a queen on g3 and rook on g2, creating some pressure. I have two knights well-placed on f4 and g1, which are strong outposts.

Let me analyze the key candidate moves:

1. **f4e2+** - This knight move gives check to the White king on e1, forcing a response
2. **f4d3** - Attacks the rook on g2 and centralizes the knight
3. **g1f3** - Develops the knight to a more active square
4. **d8f6** - Develops the queen with potential tactical ideas

The check with Ne2+ looks very strong as it forces White's king to move and disrupts their coordination. After the king moves, I'll have gained tempo and can continue with my development or tactical operations.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

I can see this is a complex middle game position. Let me analyze the key features:

1. White has a queen on g3 and rooks on a4 and g2
2. I have knights on d4 and g1 - both are actively placed
3. White's king is on e1, which looks somewhat exposed
4. I have a pawn on e5 that's advanced

Looking at my options, I notice some strong tactical possibilities:

- My knight on d4 is very well-placed and can move to several strong squares
- My knight on g1 can also create threats
- The move d4e2+ looks particularly interesting as it would be a check, forking the king and potentially winning material

Let me play the knight fork:

I can see this is a complex middlegame position. Let me analyze the key features:

1. White has both rooks active (on a4 and g2)
2. White's king is on e1, still in the center
3. I have a knight on e2 that's quite active
4. My king is still on e8, also in the center
5. I have a pawn on e5 that's advanced

Looking at the position, I notice that White's king on e1 looks vulnerable, and my knight on e2 is in an excellent central position. The knight can move to several strong squares.

One particularly attractive option is Ne2-d4, which would:
- Centralize the knight on an excellent outpost
- Put pressure on White's position
- Control key central squares

Let me make this move:

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Looking at this position, I can see that White has developed aggressively with a rook on a4 and another on g2, plus a queen on g3. My king is still in the center on e8, which is concerning. I have a knight actively placed on d4, which is a strong outpost.

Let me analyze the key candidate moves:

1. **d4e6** - This centralizes my knight further and attacks the g5 square, potentially preparing to challenge White's pieces.

2. **d4f3** - This attacks the rook on g2 and creates immediate tactical threats.

3. **e8e7** or **d8e7** - Getting my king to safety should be a priority.

4. **d4e2** - This forks the king on e1 and potentially creates tactical opportunities.

Wait, looking more carefully at the position, I notice that **d4f3** would attack the White rook on g2, and this could be very strong tactically. The knight would be well-placed on f3, attacking multiple pieces and creating immediate threats.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Looking at this position, I can see that White has a very active setup with the queen on g3 and rooks on a4 and g2. My king on e8 is still in the center, which is concerning. Let me analyze the key features:

1. My king needs safety - castling isn't available since there are pieces between king and rook
2. White's queen on g3 is very active and potentially threatening
3. I have a knight on f3 that's well-placed in White's territory
4. My pawn on e5 is advanced and could become weak

I should prioritize king safety while maintaining my active pieces. The move **d8e7** looks good as it:
- Moves my queen to a more active square
- Prepares to potentially castle queenside later
- Keeps pressure on the center
- Doesn't block my own pieces

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Let me analyze this position. I can see that:

1. White has a queen on g3 and a rook on g2, creating some pressure
2. My king is on e8 and hasn't castled yet
3. I have a queen on e7 and knights on f3 and g1
4. White has advanced pawns and seems to be in an attacking formation

Looking at the available moves, I notice I have a knight on f3 that's quite active. Let me consider some key candidate moves:

1. **f3d4** - Centralizing the knight to a strong outpost
2. **e7d6** or **e7f6** - Moving my queen to safety while maintaining activity
3. **e8d8** - Getting my king to relative safety
4. **f3g5** - Attacking and creating threats

The knight move to d4 looks very appealing as it centralizes the piece, attacks multiple squares, and puts pressure on White's position. From d4, the knight would control many important central squares.

2. My king on e8 is still uncastled and potentially vulnerable
3. I have two knights - one actively placed on d4 and another on g1
4. White's king appears to be on f1

The knight on d4 is very well-placed in the center. Let me look for the most forcing moves. I notice that my knight on d4 can potentially create threats.

Looking at the knight moves from d4, I see d4e2 is available, which would be a fork attacking both the king on f1 and potentially other pieces.

Let me examine this more carefully - if I play Ne2+, this gives check to the white king on f1 and also attacks the queen on g3!

Let me analyze this position. I can see that:

1. White has a queen on g3 and rooks on g2 and e1
2. My king is on e8 and appears to be in some danger
3. I have a queen on e7 and knights on e2 and g1
4. White has advanced pawns creating some pressure

Looking at the position more carefully, I notice that White's king is on f1 and there might be tactical opportunities. My knight on e2 is very well placed, and I should look for forcing moves.

Let me examine the knight on e2 - it can move to several squares including d4, f4, g3, and c3. The move to g3 would be particularly interesting as it would attack the White queen.

However, I notice that there might be an even stronger move. Let me check if the knight can deliver check or create immediate threats.

Looking at this position, I can see that White has their king on f2 and rooks on g2 and e1, while I have my queen on e7 and knights on g3 and g1. This appears to be a complex middlegame position.

Let me analyze the key features:
- My knight on g3 is very well placed, attacking several squares
- My queen on e7 is centralized and active
- White's king looks somewhat exposed on f2
- I have a pawn on e5 that's advanced

I notice that my knight on g3 can move to e4, which would be a strong central square, or to e2, which would fork the king and rook! Let me check this tactical opportunity.

The move Ng3-e2+ would be a knight fork, checking the white king on f2 and simultaneously attacking the rook on g2. This is a classic tactical motif that should win material.

Now I can see my available moves. Let me analyze the key tactical possibilities:

Looking at the position, I notice:
1. My knight on e2 is very well placed near White's king on f2
2. I have another knight on g1 that could also contribute to an attack
3. White's king looks somewhat exposed on f2

Let me look for the most forcing moves. The knight on e2 can give check or create threats. The move that stands out is:

**e2g3** - This knight move would give check to the White king on f2, forcing it to move and potentially allowing me to continue with tactical pressure.

This appears to be the most forcing continuation that maintains the initiative.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Let me analyze this position. I can see that:

1. White has castled kingside with the king on f2 and rooks on e2 and g2
2. I have my queen on e7 in a central position
3. I have two knights - one on g3 (very active, close to White's king) and one on g1
4. White has advanced pawns on a5, c3, and e3
5. My king is still on e8 (uncastled)

The knight on g3 is in an excellent attacking position near White's king. Let me look for the most forcing moves.

From the legal moves, I notice that my knight on g3 can go to several strong squares:
- g3e4 (centralizing and attacking)
- g3e2+ (this would be check, forking king and rook!)
- g3f5 (attacking)
- g3h5 (attacking)

The move g3e2+ looks very strong as it gives check and forks the king on f2 and the rook on g2!

2. **e7e6** - Centralizing my queen
3. **g1f3** - Developing my other knight

The move **e2g3+** stands out immediately as it wins material by capturing the white rook while giving check to the white king on f2. This is clearly the best move as it gains a significant material advantage.

4. White's king appears to be on f2

Looking at the position, I notice that my knight on g3 has some interesting tactical possibilities. Let me examine the move Ng3-e2+, which would be a fork attacking both the white king on f2 and potentially other pieces.

From the legal moves list, I can see "g3e2" is available, which would put the white king in check and create a powerful fork.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Looking at this position, I can see that White has made some early development with knights on b1 and g1, and their king appears to be on f1. My pieces are mostly on their starting squares, but I notice my queen is actively placed on e7.

Let me analyze the key features:
- White's king is still in the center on f1, which could be a target
- I have my queen actively placed on e7
- White has advanced some pawns (a5, c3, e4) 
- My knights are on e2 and g1 (which seems unusual - let me double-check this position)

Given that White's king hasn't castled and is somewhat exposed on f1, I should look for active moves that can create threats or improve my position. 

The move **e7d6** looks appealing as it:
1. Centralizes my queen
2. Keeps pressure on White's position
3. Maintains flexibility for future moves

However, let me also consider **e7f6**, which attacks the advanced e4 pawn and puts more direct pressure on White's position.

After careful consideration, I'll go with:

Looking at this position, I can see that White has made some early pawn advances and developed a knight to b1. My king is still on e8 and hasn't castled yet. I have my queen actively placed on f6 and knights on e2 and g1.

Let me analyze the key features:
- White's king is on e1 and also hasn't castled
- My queen on f6 is well-centralized
- I have tactical opportunities with my knights
- White has some pawn weaknesses

I notice that my knight on e2 can move to several strong squares. The move Nd4 (e2d4) looks particularly appealing as it:
1. Centralizes the knight on an excellent outpost
2. Attacks multiple squares
3. Puts pressure on White's position
4. Cannot be easily challenged by White's pawns

Looking at this position, I can see that White's king is quite exposed on e1 and I have some tactical opportunities. Let me analyze the key features:

1. White's king is still on e1 (hasn't castled)
2. I have a queen on f6 that's very actively placed
3. I have knights on d4 and g1 - the knight on g1 is particularly interesting as it's deep in White's territory
4. White has some pawn weaknesses

The knight on g1 can deliver a powerful fork. Let me play:

make_move g1f3

This move puts the knight on f3, giving check to the White king on e1 while also attacking other pieces, creating a royal fork that should win material.

2. White's king is on f2, which looks quite exposed

Let me analyze the most promising moves:

- My knight on f3 can give check with moves like f3e1+ or f3d2+
- My knight on d4 is well-centralized
- My queen on f6 is actively placed

The move f3e1 looks particularly strong as it would be check, forcing the White king to move and potentially allowing me to follow up with a devastating attack.

Let me look for the most forcing moves. I notice my queen on f6 has many options, and my knight on d4 is also well-placed.

The move that stands out to me is **d4e2+** - this would be a knight check, forking the king and likely winning material or creating a devastating attack.

Looking at this position, I can see:

2. I have a queen on f6 that's very actively placed
3. White has a king on e1 that also appears to be in the center
4. I have a knight on e2 that's very well placed, close to the white king

This looks like a tactical position where I should look for forcing moves. Let me analyze the most promising options:

The knight on e2 is in an excellent position and can give check or create threats. Looking at the knight moves available: e2f4, e2d4, e2g3, e2c3, e2g1, e2c1.

The move **e2g3** looks very strong as it would:
1. Attack squares around the white king
2. Potentially set up tactical threats
3. Keep the knight actively placed

However, let me also consider queen moves since the queen on f6 is very active. Moves like f6f1+ could be check if the white king is on e1.

Given the position and the need to maintain pressure, I'll play the knight move that keeps maximum pressure on White's position.

Looking at this position, I can see that White has a significant material advantage with a rook on h8, while I have a queen on f6 and a knight on g3. My king appears to be in a precarious position on e8.

Let me analyze the key tactical opportunities:

1. My knight on g3 has several interesting moves
2. My queen on f6 is well-placed and has many options
3. I need to look for forcing moves given the material deficit

The knight move g3e4 looks very interesting as it centralizes the knight and potentially creates threats. Let me also consider queen moves that might create immediate threats.

However, g3e4 stands out because:
- It centralizes the knight powerfully
- It potentially supports tactics involving my queen
- It moves the knight to a more active square

Let me examine if there are any immediate tactical opportunities. The white king on e1 looks very exposed, and with my queen on f6, I might have a powerful check or even checkmate threat.

Looking at the queen moves available, f6f1 would give check to the white king on e1, and this could be a very strong forcing move.

Looking at the position, I can see:

- My king is on e8 and appears to be in a somewhat exposed position
- I have a knight on e4 which is well-centralized
- White has a rook on g8 which could be creating some pressure
- White's king is on f1

The knight on e4 is in an excellent central position with many good squares available. Let me look for the most effective move.

From the legal moves, I notice the knight can go to several strong squares:
- e4f6 would attack potential weaknesses
- e4d6 would centralize further
- e4f2 would be a fork, checking the king on f1 and potentially attacking other pieces
- e4d2 would also be very active

The move Nf2+ looks particularly attractive as it gives check to the White king on f1, forcing White to respond to the check while improving my knight's position.

Looking at this position, I can see:

2. I have a knight on f2 which is very actively placed, deep in White's territory
3. White's king is on g3, also in an exposed position
4. I have several pawns that can advance

The knight on f2 is in an excellent attacking position. Let me look for the most forcing move. The knight can give check with Nh3+ or Ne4+, or it can capture something.

Looking at the knight moves available:
- f2g4 (Ng4+) - this would be check to the White king on g3
- f2e4 (Ne4+) - this would also be check
- f2h3 (Nh3) - attacks but no immediate check
- f2h1 (Nh1) - retreats the knight
- f2d3 (Nd3) - centralizes but less forcing
- f2d1 (Nd1) - retreats

Between the checking moves, Ng4+ looks very strong as it forces the White king to move and maintains pressure.

e8f8,e8e7

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

I can see I have very limited options with only two legal moves for my king: e8f8 and e8e7. This suggests I'm in check or in a very constrained position. Let me analyze the position more carefully:

Looking at the board, I can see:
- My king is on e8
- There's a white rook on f8 (which explains why I'm in check)
- I have a black rook on a8, bishop on c8, and some pawns
- White has pieces creating threats

Since I'm in check from the white rook on f8, I must move my king. Between the two options:
- e8f8 would capture the white rook
- e8e7 would move to e7

Capturing the rook is clearly the better choice as it removes a major attacking piece and gains material.

Looking at this position, I can see:

1. My king on f8 is somewhat exposed
2. I have a knight on g4 that's actively placed
3. White has a king on g3 and some pawns, with a knight on a3
4. There's material imbalance - the position looks like an endgame

Let me analyze the key candidate moves:

- **g4e3+**: This knight move gives check to the white king on g3, forcing it to move
- **g4f2**: Attacks and potentially forks
- **g4h2**: Moves the knight to the edge but might have tactical ideas
- King moves like **f8g8** or **f8e8** to improve king safety

The check with g4e3+ looks very appealing as it forces White's king to move and maintains active play with my knight.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Let me analyze this position. I can see:

- My king is on f8
- I have a rook on a8
- I have a knight on e3 (which is quite active)
- White's king is on g3
- There's a white knight on h8 and another on a3

Looking at the available moves, my knight on e3 has many good options. Let me consider the most forcing moves:

1. **e3f1** - This would be a strong move, putting my knight deep in White's position
2. **e3d1** - Another deep penetration 
3. **e3f5** - Centralizing the knight and potentially eyeing key squares
4. **e3g2** - Getting close to the white king

Given that White's king is somewhat exposed on g3, I think the most forcing move would be to bring my knight closer to create threats.

Looking at this position, I can see:

1. My king is on f8 and appears to be in a somewhat exposed position
2. I have a rook on a8, bishop on c8, and knight on f1
3. White has a king on g2 and knight on a3
4. There are several pawn moves available

Let me analyze the key candidate moves:

- King moves (f8g8, f8e8, etc.) - to improve king safety
- f1g3 or f1e3 - developing the knight to a more active square
- Pawn advances like e5e4, f7f5, d7d5 - gaining space

The knight on f1 is quite passive, and f1g3 would put it on a much better central square where it can influence the center and potentially support future attacks. This seems like the most constructive move.

Looking at the position, I can see:

- My king is on f8 and appears to be somewhat exposed
- I have a knight on g3 that's actively placed
- White has a knight on h8 and king on g1
- There's a pawn structure that suggests we're in a complex middlegame/endgame

The knight on g3 is very well-placed and I should look for tactical opportunities. Let me examine the move g3e2+ - this would be a knight fork, giving check to the white king on g1 while potentially attacking other pieces.

Looking at the position more carefully, g3e2 would indeed give check to the king on g1, which is a forcing move that will disrupt White's coordination.

Looking at the position, I can see:

- White has a king on f2, knights on h8 and a6, and pawns on a5, c5, and b2
- I have a knight on e2 which is in a very active position near White's king

The knight on e2 is excellently placed and can create immediate threats. Let me analyze the key knight moves:

1. **e2f4** - Attacks the king and potentially forks
2. **e2d4** - Centralizes the knight
3. **e2g3** - Attacks near the king
4. **e2c3** - Moves toward the queenside

The move **e2f4** looks particularly strong as it gives check to the White king on f2, forcing it to move and maintaining the initiative.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Looking at this position, I can see that Black has a knight on f4 that's quite actively placed. Let me analyze the key features:

- White's king is on f2, somewhat exposed
- I have a knight on f4 that can create threats
- White has pawns on a6, c5, and b4
- My king is on f8 and appears safe

The knight on f4 is in an excellent position and can create immediate threats. Let me look at the most forcing moves:

1. **f4e2+** - This gives check to the White king on f2, forcing it to move
2. **f4g2** - This attacks the king and potentially forks
3. **f4d3** - Centralizes the knight further

The check with Ne2+ looks very strong as it forces White's king to move and maintains the initiative.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Looking at this position, I can see:

1. My king is on f8 and appears to be somewhat exposed
2. White has a knight on e2 that's quite active and centralized
3. I have a pawn on e5 that could advance
4. My rook is on a8 and bishop on c8

Let me analyze the key candidate moves:

- **e5e4**: This advances my central pawn, gaining space and potentially restricting White's pieces
- **f8g8** or **f8e8**: King moves for safety
- **e2f4, e2d4, e2g3**: These are White's knight moves (seems like there might be an error in the move list showing White's moves)

Wait, I notice the legal moves list includes moves like "e2f4" and "e2d4" which would be moving White's knight on e2. This seems incorrect for Black's legal moves. Let me focus on the moves that make sense for Black:

The most logical Black moves from this list are:
- **e5e4**: Advancing the central pawn
- **f8g8, f8e8, f8g7, f8e7**: King moves
- **a8b8**: Rook move
- **b7b6, b7b5, b7a6**: Pawn moves
- **f7f6, f7f5**: Pawn moves
- **d7d6, d7d5**: Pawn moves
- **c7c6**: Pawn move

Given the position, I think advancing the central pawn with **e5e4** is the strongest move, as it:
1. Gains central space
2. Advances my most advanced pawn
3. Potentially cramps White's position

4. There's a black pawn on e4 that's advanced

Let me analyze the key candidate moves:

- **e2d4**: Another strong central knight move
- **e2g3**: Attacks the white king area
- **e4e3**: Pushes the advanced pawn closer to promotion

The knight on e2 is in an excellent position. Moving it to f4 would be very strong as it:
- Controls key central squares
- Puts pressure on White's position
- Maintains the knight's active role

1. White's king is on d1, quite exposed
2. I have a knight on f4 that's well-placed in the center
3. White has a knight on g8 (which seems unusual - likely promoted or moved there)
4. My king is on f8

Let me look for the most forcing moves. I notice my knight on f4 has several good options. The move f4e2+ looks very promising as it would be a knight fork, giving check to the White king on d1 while potentially attacking another piece.

Looking at the position, I can see this is an endgame with:
- Black: King on f8, Bishop on c8, pawns on a7, b7, c7, d7, f7, e4
- White: King on d1, Knights on a3 and g6, pawns on a6, c6, b4

My legal moves are with the king on f8: Kg8, Ke8, Kg7, or the pawn move f7-g6.

The white knight on g6 is very actively placed and putting pressure on my position. I should consider eliminating this strong piece. The move f7xg6 would capture the knight, which would be excellent for my position as:

1. It removes White's most active piece
2. It opens up my king position 
3. Material gain is always valuable in endgames

Looking at this position, I can see:

- My king is on f8 and appears to be in a somewhat exposed position
- I have a rook on a8, bishop on c8, and pawns on various squares
- White has a king on d1, knight on c4, and several pawns
- There's a black pawn on e4 that's quite advanced

Let me analyze the key candidate moves:

1. **e4e3** - This pushes my advanced pawn closer to promotion, which could be very strong
2. **d7d5** - Attacks the white knight on c4 and opens up the position
3. **King moves** - To improve king safety
4. **g6g5** - Advances the kingside pawn

The pawn on e4 advancing to e3 looks very promising as it's getting close to the first rank and could become a serious promotion threat. This also puts pressure on White's position.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Looking at this position, I can see that:

1. My king is on f8 and appears to be somewhat exposed
2. I have a rook on a8, bishop on c8, and pawns on various squares
3. White has a knight on c4 that's quite active
4. White has pawns advanced on a6 and c6, creating pressure

Let me analyze the key candidate moves:

- King moves (f8g8, f8e8, etc.) - Getting my king to safety is important
- Knight moves from e2 - This knight can become more active
- Pawn moves - d7d6/d7d5 and b7b6/b7b5 to deal with White's pawn pressure

The most pressing concern is my king safety. Moving the king to g8 would be natural castling-like safety, but I also notice that my knight on e2 is quite passive and could become more active.

However, I think the most important move here is to deal with White's advanced pawns and improve my position. The move d7d5 looks strong as it:
1. Challenges White's central control
2. Opens up my position
3. Gives my pieces more breathing room

- **f8g8** or **f8e8**: King moves for safety
- **d5d4**: Advancing my central pawn to gain space

The knight on e2 is very well-placed and can create threats. Moving it to f4 would attack key central squares and potentially support future tactics.

Looking at the available moves, I notice I have an advanced pawn on e3 that could be very dangerous. The move e3e2 would push this pawn to the second rank, creating immediate threats against White's king.

This pawn advance would be very forcing and put significant pressure on White, as the pawn would be just one square away from promoting.

I can see this is an endgame position where I have a significant advantage. I have a pawn on e2 that's about to promote, which is very powerful. Let me analyze the key options:

1. I can promote the e2 pawn to a queen with either `e2d1q` (capturing) or `e2e1q` (straight promotion)
2. I have other pieces that can create threats

The pawn promotion to a queen is clearly the strongest move here, as it will give me a decisive material advantage. Between the two promotion options, `e2e1q` looks better as it doesn't capture anything and simply promotes the pawn straight to a queen.

I can see this is an interesting middlegame position. Let me analyze the key features:

- Black king on f8 looks somewhat exposed
- Black has a knight actively placed on f4
- White has a knight on d1 and king on e1, suggesting the white king hasn't castled
- There's a pawn structure with black having pawns on a7, b7, c7, d5, g6

Looking at the available moves, I notice several interesting tactical possibilities:

1. The knight on f4 has many good squares
2. The bishop on c8 can develop actively
3. The rook on a8 has some mobility

I think the most forcing and strong move here is to attack with the knight. The move **f4e2** looks very strong as it gives check to the white king on e1 and creates a fork, likely winning material.

I can see this is an endgame position. Let me analyze the current situation:

- I have: King on f8, Bishop on c8, Rook on a8, and pawns on b7, g6, d5
- White has: King on e1, Knight on e4, and pawns on a6, c6, b4

This appears to be a complex endgame where I need to be careful about my king safety and piece coordination. Let me look for the most forcing and beneficial move.

The white king is quite active on e1, and the knight on e4 is well-placed. I notice that my king on f8 is somewhat restricted, and I should look for ways to improve my piece activity.

Looking at the position, I think moving my king to improve its activity while maintaining safety would be good. The move Kg7 (f8g7) would centralize my king and give it more mobility.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Looking at this position, I can see that:

1. My king is on g7 and appears to be in a somewhat exposed position
2. I have a rook on a8, a bishop on c8, a knight on e2, and several pawns
3. White has a king on e1 and a knight on g4
4. There's a pawn on d5 that could advance

Let me analyze the key candidate moves:

- **d5d4**: This advances my central pawn and gains space, putting pressure on White's position
- **e2f4** or **e2d4**: These knight moves could be active
- **g6g5**: This attacks White's knight on g4
- **King moves**: My king on g7 has several escape squares

The move **g6g5** looks very appealing as it directly attacks the White knight on g4, forcing it to move and gaining tempo. This also advances my kingside pawns and improves my position.

Looking at this position, I can see:

- I have a black king on g7
- A black rook on a8
- A black bishop on c8
- Black pawns on a7 and d5
- White has a king on e1, knight on g4, and pawns on b4 and c6

This appears to be an endgame position. Let me analyze the key considerations:

1. White has a dangerous passed pawn on c6
2. My king on g7 seems somewhat out of play
3. I need to coordinate my pieces to deal with White's threats

The most pressing concern is the advanced white pawn on c6. I should look for active moves that either create counterplay or help coordinate my pieces.

Looking at my options, I think activating my bishop makes sense. The move Bd7 would:
- Develop the bishop to a more active square
- Potentially support the advance of my d-pawn
- Keep an eye on the white pawn structure

- Potentially support my d5 pawn

2. I have a rook on a8 that can move along the 8th rank
3. I have a bishop on d7 that's well-placed
4. I have a knight on c3 that's very active and close to the White king

The knight on c3 has several interesting options. Let me look for the most forcing move that creates immediate threats.

The move **Ne2+** looks very strong - it gives check to the White king on c1, forcing the king to move and potentially winning material or creating a decisive attack.

- I have a rook on h8, bishop on d7, king on g7, and pawns on a7 and d5
- White has a king on a1, knight on g4, and pawns on b4 and c6

This appears to be a winning endgame for Black due to my material advantage (rook and bishop vs knight). My strategy should be to:
1. Improve my piece coordination
2. Advance my passed pawns
3. Look for tactical opportunities

The most forcing move appears to be advancing my d-pawn, which creates immediate threats and puts pressure on White's position.

Looking at this position, I can see:

- I have a rook on h8, king on g7, bishop on d7, knight on e2, and pawns on a7, g5, and d4
- White has a king on a1, knight on f2, and pawns on b4, c5, and b7

This appears to be an endgame position. Let me analyze the key features:

1. My rook is very active on h8
2. My knight on e2 is well-placed and can create threats
3. I have a passed pawn on d4 that could be dangerous
4. White's king looks somewhat exposed on a1

I think the most forcing move here would be to advance my passed d-pawn, putting immediate pressure on White and potentially creating tactical opportunities.

4. White's king is on a1, quite far from the action
5. White has a knight on f2

This appears to be an endgame position. Let me look for the most forcing moves. I notice my knight on e2 is well-placed and can create threats.

The move **e2d4** looks very strong as it:
- Centralizes my knight to an excellent outpost
- Controls key squares like c6, e6, f5, and b5
- Puts pressure on White's position
- Improves my piece coordination

- This appears to be an endgame position

I notice that my knight on d4 is very well-placed in the center. Let me look for the most forcing moves. I can see that my knight on d7 can move to several squares, and my rook has good mobility on the h-file and 8th rank.

One particularly interesting option is to advance my passed d-pawn with d3d2, which would create immediate threats and put pressure on White.

Looking at this position, I can see:

- My king is on g7 in a somewhat exposed position
- I have a rook on h8, a knight on d4, a queen on d1, and pawns on a7 and g5
- White has their king on a3, a knight on h3, another knight on d7, and pawns on b4 and c6

This appears to be an endgame position. My knight on d4 is well-centralized, and my queen on d1 is very active on the back rank.

Let me look for the most forcing move. I notice that my queen on d1 has many options, and one particularly strong move stands out:

make_move d1a1

This move puts my queen on the back rank attacking along the a-file, and it appears to create serious threats against White's exposed king on a3. The queen will be attacking the king and potentially creating mating threats.

I can see this is an early position where White has played 1.a3 (a pawn move to a3). This is an unusual and non-aggressive opening move. Let me check my legal moves to see my options.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

I can see all the typical opening moves available. Since White played the passive 1.a3, I have the opportunity to seize the center immediately. I'll play a classical central pawn move.

make_move e7e5

This move:
- Controls the center squares d4 and f4
- Opens lines for my bishop and queen
- Follows sound opening principles by occupying the center
- Takes advantage of White's non-developing first move

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

I can see this is the opening position after White has played e2-e4 and I responded with e7-e5. This is a very common opening sequence. Now I need to develop my pieces effectively.

Looking at the available moves, I have several good developmental options:
- Knight moves: Ng8-f6, Nb8-c6
- Bishop moves: Bf8-c5, Bf8-e7, etc.
- Pawn moves for space or development

The most principled approach is to develop knights before bishops. Nf6 is an excellent move as it:
1. Develops the knight to its best square
2. Attacks the e4 pawn
3. Controls important central squares
4. Follows opening principles

I can see this is an early game position where White has played an early f3 (which weakened their kingside) and I have a knight on f6. Looking at the position, I notice that White's king is still in the center and their f3 move has created some weaknesses.

Let me develop my pieces actively. I'll bring my knight from b8 to c6, which is a natural developing move that controls central squares and prepares for further piece development.

Now I can see my available moves. Looking at the position, I'm in what appears to be an Italian Game or similar opening. White has developed a knight to c3 and I have knights on c6 and f6 with my e-pawn on e5.

I want to continue developing my pieces actively. The move d7-d6 would support my e5 pawn and prepare to develop my light-squared bishop, which is a solid continuation. Alternatively, f8-c5 would develop my bishop immediately to an active square, putting pressure on f2.

I think developing the bishop actively is the better choice here.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Looking at this position, I can see several interesting options. White has a knight aggressively placed on d5, and my king is still in the center. Let me consider my main strategic options:

1. **Castling kingside (e8g8)** - This would improve my king safety
2. **Challenging the knight on d5** - I could play Nxd5 to remove White's strong centralized knight
3. **Developing moves** - Various piece moves to improve my position

The knight on d5 is quite strong for White, controlling important central squares. I think I should challenge it directly.

make_move f6d5

This captures White's centralized knight with my knight, removing a key piece from White's position and improving my control of the center.

2. I have active pieces - knights on c6 and d5, bishop on c5
3. My knight on d5 is very well-placed in the center
4. White's king looks vulnerable

I notice that I can play **d5e3+**, which would be a knight fork! This move:
- Gives check to the White king on e1
- Simultaneously attacks what appears to be a piece (likely the queen on d1 or another valuable piece)
- Forces White into a difficult position

This is a classic tactical motif - a knight fork that wins material.

2. My knight on e3 is very well-placed, attacking multiple squares
3. I have another knight on c6 that can also create threats
4. My bishops are still on their starting squares but have potential

The knight on e3 is in an excellent outpost position. Let me look for the most forcing move. I notice that my knight on e3 can move to d1, which would be a powerful fork attacking the white king on e1 and potentially other pieces.

Wait, let me reconsider the position more carefully. The knight on e3 has several strong options, but I should look for the most forcing continuation.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Looking at this position, I can see that White has developed some pieces and there's tactical potential in the center. Let me analyze the key features:

1. White has a bishop on e2 and a knight on g1
2. My knight on d1 is well-placed and can create threats
3. My bishops on c8 and c5 have good scope
4. White's king is still in the center on e1

I notice that my knight on d1 can move to several strong squares. The move Nd1-e3 looks particularly attractive because:
- It attacks the bishop on e2
- It centralizes my knight on an excellent outpost
- It puts pressure on White's position
- It potentially forks multiple pieces

- I have knights on c6 and e3 (the knight on e3 is in an advanced position)
- I have bishops on c8 and c5
- There's a black pawn on e5

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Excellent! I can see several strong tactical options. The knight on e3 is perfectly placed for some devastating moves. Let me analyze the key candidates:

1. **e3g2** - This would be a knight fork, attacking both the king on e1 and likely winning material
2. **e3f1** - Another strong knight move putting pressure on White's position
3. **e3d1** - Attacks the back rank

The knight fork with e3g2 looks particularly strong as it would attack the White king and force it to move, likely winning material in the process.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Looking at this position, I can see some very interesting tactical opportunities. My knight on g2 is in a fantastic advanced position, and I notice that White's king on f1 looks vulnerable.

Let me examine the knight on g2's possibilities:
- g2e1+ would be check, forking the king and potentially winning material
- g2e3 attacks the bishop on e2
- g2f4 centralizes the knight
- g2h4 attacks but seems less effective

The move g2e1+ looks particularly strong as it gives check and forces the White king to move, likely winning the exchange or other material through the fork.

1. White's king is on f1, which is relatively unsafe
2. I have a knight on e1 that's very actively placed
3. I have bishops on c5 and c8 that can potentially create threats
4. White's king lacks proper castling safety

The knight on e1 is in an excellent position to create threats. I notice I can play Nf3+, which would be a check that forces the white king to move and potentially wins material or creates a strong attack.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Looking at this position, I can see that White has castled kingside and has developed some pieces. I notice that White's king is on f1, which suggests they may have lost castling rights or made some unusual moves.

Let me analyze some key features:
- My king is still on e8 and I have castling options available (both kingside with h8g8 and what appears to be queenside)
- I have knights on c6 and f3, with the f3 knight in an advanced position
- My bishop on c5 is actively placed
- White's king position on f1 looks somewhat exposed

The knight on f3 is in a very strong position, giving check or creating threats. Let me look for the most forcing moves.

I notice that my knight on f3 can move to several squares. The move f3d2 looks particularly interesting as it would be a fork, attacking both the king on f1 and potentially other pieces.

Looking at this position, I can see that White has developed their bishops to d4 and e4, and I have a knight on c6 and bishop on c5. This appears to be an opening or early middlegame position.

Let me analyze the key features:
- White has bishops on d4 and e4 (strong central control)
- My knight on c6 is well-placed
- My bishop on c5 is actively placed
- I haven't castled yet, but I have the option (e8g8)

I think castling kingside would be a good move here to improve my king safety, as it's a fundamental principle to get the king to safety early in the game.

1. White's king is on f1 (having castled kingside)
2. I have a bishop on c5 that's very actively placed
3. My knight on c6 has several good squares
4. White's pieces aren't fully developed yet

One move that stands out is **c5f2+** - this would be a powerful bishop check that forks the king and likely wins material, as the bishop would be attacking the king on f1 and potentially other pieces.

Let me execute this tactical shot:

- I'm playing as Black
- White has castled kingside (King on f1, Rook on h1)
- I have a knight on c6 and my king is still on g8
- White has bishops on c1 and e2
- There are pawns advanced in the center

Let me check what legal moves are available to me.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Now I can see my available moves. Let me analyze the position more carefully:

Looking at the board, I notice:
- White has a bishop on e2 and another on c1
- My bishop is on f2, which seems to be in an advanced position
- I have a knight on c6
- My queen is on d8
- White's king is on f1 (castled kingside)

The bishop on f2 is in a very strong position, deep in White's territory. I should look for tactical opportunities.

I notice that my bishop on f2 can potentially create threats. Let me consider the move Bxe1, which would capture something on e1 (likely giving check or winning material), or Be3 to maintain pressure.

Looking at the position more carefully, if I play **Bxe1+**, this would be check to the White king on f1, forcing a response and likely winning material.

Now I can analyze the position. I see that:

1. White has a bishop on e1 that appears to be quite active
2. I have a knight on c6 and my pieces are generally well-developed
3. White has advanced pawns on b4, c5, and h4
4. My king is on g8 and appears safe for now

Looking at the available moves, I notice some interesting tactical possibilities. The move "e1h4" in my legal moves list suggests that my bishop on e1 can capture something on h4, but looking at the board, I think this might be referring to my dark-squared bishop.

Let me make a strong developing move that improves my position. I'll play my knight from c6 to d4, which centralizes it and puts pressure on White's position.

I can see this is a complex middlegame position. Let me analyze the key features:

- I have a knight on d4, which is very well-placed in the center
- White has a bishop on e1 and another on c1
- White's king is on f1, which looks somewhat exposed
- I have my queen on d8 and rooks on a8 and f8

Looking at the tactical possibilities, I notice that my knight on d4 is very active and can create threats. Let me examine the move Nd4-e2+, which would be a fork attacking both the king on f1 and potentially other pieces.

This knight move to e2 would give check to the White king on f1, forcing it to move and potentially winning material or gaining a strong positional advantage.

Excellent! I can see I have many options. Let me analyze the key tactical possibilities:

The knight on e2 is in a fantastic position - it's forking the king and potentially other pieces. I notice I have several strong knight moves available:

1. **e2g1+** - This would be check, forcing the white king to move
2. **e2f4** - Attacks multiple squares
3. **e2d4** - Centralizes the knight
4. **e2g3** - Also looks active

The move **e2g1+** stands out because it gives check, which forces White's response and maintains the initiative. This is typically a strong principle in tactical positions - when you can give check and maintain pressure, it's often the right choice.

2. I have a queen on d8 with several good squares available
3. There's a white bishop on f6 that's quite active
4. White has some pieces developed but my position looks reasonable

Let me analyze some key candidate moves:

- **d8e7** or **d8e8**: These would improve my queen's position and potentially prepare castling coordination
- **g1f3** or **g1e2**: Developing my knight from g1
- **e5e4**: Advancing my central pawn to gain space

Given the position, I think developing my knight while maintaining central control would be good. The knight on g1 is currently out of play.

- **f3g5**: Attacks the h7 square and centralizes the knight
- **d8h4**: Brings the queen into an attacking position
- **e1h4**: Bishop move that could create threats

The knight check with f3h2+ looks very promising as it forces White's king to move and gives me tempo.

Now I can see the available moves. Looking at the position, I notice:

1. White's king is on g2 and appears somewhat exposed
2. I have a knight on h2 that's in an advanced position
3. My queen on d8 has several good squares available
4. White has bishops on e4 and e1

Let me look for the most forcing moves. The knight on h2 can give check with Ng4+, which would be a strong move as it forces the white king to move and keeps the initiative.

Looking at this position, I can see that:

1. White has a king on g2 that appears somewhat exposed
2. I have a knight on g4 that's actively placed
3. My bishop on e1 is well-positioned on the long diagonal
4. White has rooks on a1 and h1, and a bishop on a7

I notice that my knight on g4 can deliver a powerful fork. Let me play:

make_move g4h2

This move puts my knight on h2, giving check to the White king on g2 while simultaneously attacking the rook on h1. This is a classic knight fork that will win material.

Looking at this position, I can see that White has made some aggressive moves with pieces like the bishop on b6 and a pawn on h4. My king appears to be on g7, and I have several tactical options available.

Let me analyze the key features:
- White has a bishop actively placed on b6
- There's a white pawn on h4 that could be part of a kingside attack
- My knight on h2 is well-placed and has several good squares
- My bishop on e1 has multiple options

I notice that my knight on h2 can move to some very strong squares. The move Ng4 would be particularly interesting as it attacks multiple squares and could create tactical threats.

Looking at this position, I can see:

1. White has a king on g2 and rooks on a1 and h1
2. White has a bishop on a5 and pawns on a3, b4, c6, and h5
3. Black has the king on g8, rooks on a8 and f8, queen on d8, bishop on e1, and knight on g4
4. Black has pawns on b7, d7, e5, f7, g7, and h7

This appears to be a complex middlegame position. I notice that my bishop on e1 is very actively placed, and my knight on g4 is also well-positioned. Let me look for the most forcing moves.

The knight on g4 has several interesting options, including Nh6+ and Nf6+, both giving check. Let me also consider the powerful bishop on e1.

I think the most forcing and strong move here is to play the knight to f6, giving check and creating immediate threats.

Looking at this position, I can see that White has made some aggressive moves with pawns advanced and a bishop on a5. My king appears to be in a somewhat exposed position on g8, and I need to improve my piece coordination.

Let me analyze the key features:
- My king on g8 needs safety
- I have a knight on f6 that's well-placed
- My rook on a8 could be more active
- White has a bishop on a5 and some advanced pawns

The move **f6e4** looks very appealing - it centralizes my knight to an excellent outpost on e4, where it will be well-placed to influence the center and potentially create tactical opportunities. From e4, the knight would control many important squares and be difficult for White to dislodge.

Looking at this position, I can see several interesting tactical possibilities. The black knight on e4 is very well-placed and has many good squares available. Let me analyze the key candidate moves:

1. **e4f2+** - This would be a knight fork, giving check to the white king on g2 and potentially attacking other pieces
2. **e4g3** - Attacks the rook on f1 and maintains central control
3. **e4d2** - Attacks the rook on e1
4. **d8h4** - Queen move that could create threats against the exposed white king

The knight fork with check looks very promising. Let me play:

1. White has a rook on f1 and g1, with the king on g1
2. White has a bishop on a5 and pawns on c3, b4, h5, a3
3. I have my queen on d8, rooks on a8 and f8, king on g8
4. I have a knight on f2 which is in a very strong position, deep in White's territory
5. My pawns are mostly intact on the 7th rank, with one advanced pawn on e5

The knight on f2 is in an excellent attacking position. Let me look for the most forcing moves. I notice that my knight can move to several squares, and one particularly interesting option is Nf2-e4, which would centralize the knight and potentially create threats.

However, I also see that Nf2-d1 could be very disruptive, potentially forking or creating tactical threats near White's back rank.

Let me play the most aggressive continuation:

Now I can see my available moves. Let me analyze this position:

Looking at the board, I can see:
- White has a rook on e4 that's quite active
- White has a rook on f1 and king on g1
- White has a bishop on a5
- I have my queen on d8, rooks on a8 and f8, and king on g8
- There's a knight on d1 (mine)

The white rook on e4 is in a strong central position. I notice I can potentially attack it or improve my piece coordination.

Looking at my options, I see several interesting possibilities:
1. d8e7 - centralizing my queen
2. f8e8 - doubling on the e-file to pressure the rook
3. Various pawn moves to improve my structure

I think the most logical move is to challenge White's active rook by putting pressure on the e-file:

Looking at this position, I can see that:

1. White has a rook on e4 that's quite active
2. White has another rook on f1 
3. White's king is on g1
4. My king is on g8 and needs to get to safety
5. I have my queen on d8 and rooks on a8 and e8

The most pressing concern is king safety. My king on g8 is somewhat exposed, and I should consider castling or moving it to a safer square.

Looking at the available moves, I notice I can move my king to h8 or f8. Given that White has active rooks, I think moving my king to h8 would be safer as it gets away from the center files where White's rooks are operating.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Looking at this position, I can see that White has a rook on e4 that appears to be quite active, and there's a White king on g1. I notice I have castling rights available (both h8g8 and e8g8 are legal moves).

Let me analyze the key features:
- My king on e8 is still in the center and hasn't castled yet
- White has rooks on e4 and f1, with the rook on e4 being particularly active
- I have a queen on d8 and rooks on a8 and h8
- There's a knight on d1 (which seems unusual - possibly White has been maneuvering pieces)

Given that my king is still uncastled and exposed in the center, and White has active pieces, I should prioritize king safety. Castling kingside looks like the most prudent move to get my king to safety and connect my rooks.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Looking at this position, I can see that White has a very active setup with rooks on e5 and f1, and a bishop on a5. My king looks somewhat exposed on g8, and I need to improve my piece coordination.

Let me analyze the key features:
- White has rooks on e5 and f1, creating pressure
- My queen on d8 and rook on a8 are not well coordinated
- My knight on d1 is actively placed but somewhat out of play
- I should look to improve my king safety and piece coordination

I think the best move here is to castle queenside to improve my king safety and connect my rooks:

make_move d8c8

This move:
1. Prepares potential queenside castling (O-O-O)
2. Gets my queen to a more active square
3. Opens up the d-file for potential rook activity
4. Improves coordination between my major pieces

This appears to be an endgame position where material coordination is crucial. Let me analyze the key candidate moves:

1. The rooks and queen need to work together
2. White's rook on c5 is quite active
3. I should look for ways to improve my piece coordination

The move **c8d8** stands out as it:
- Centralizes the queen
- Keeps pressure on White's position
- Maintains flexibility for future moves
- Doesn't block my own pieces

- My queen on d8 is quite active and has many options

Given the position, I think moving my queen to create threats or improve coordination would be good. The move Qd2+ looks particularly interesting as it gives check and forces White's king to move, potentially disrupting White's coordination.

Looking at this position, I can see that White has a rook on c5 and a bishop on a5, while I have my queen on d2 in a very active central position. My rooks are on a8 and g8, and my king is on h8.

The most striking feature is my queen's powerful position on d2. Let me look for the most forcing move.

I notice that my queen on d2 can deliver checkmate! The white king is on g1 with a rook on f1, and my queen can move to e1 to give checkmate.

Looking at this position, I can see that:

1. My king is on g8 and appears to be in a somewhat exposed position
2. White has a rook on c5 and a bishop on a5, creating some pressure
3. My queen is actively placed on e1
4. I have rooks on a8 and f1

Given the position, I want to improve my king safety while maintaining my active pieces. Moving my king to a safer square seems prudent.

I can see this is an endgame position where I'm playing as black. Let me analyze the current situation:

- White has: King on g1, two Rooks on c5 and e1, Bishop on a5, and two pawns on a4 and b4
- Black has: King on h8, two Rooks on a8 and f8, Knight on d1, and several pawns

The black knight on d1 is very actively placed and can create threats. I notice that the white king on g1 looks somewhat exposed.

Let me make a move that improves my position. The knight on d1 can move to several good squares. I'll play the knight to f2, which gives check to the white king and forces it to move.

Looking at this position, I can see:

- White has a rook on c3 and another on e1
- White has a bishop on a5 
- White has pawns on a4 and b4
- Black has rooks on a8 and f8
- Black has a knight on f2
- Black has pawns on b7, c7, f7, g7, h7
- Black king is on h8

The black knight on f2 is in an excellent attacking position near the white king on g1. I should look for the most forcing move.

The knight on f2 can give check with Nh3+ or Ne4+. Let me analyze:

- f2h3 would be Nh3+, which gives check and forks the king
- f2e4 would be Ne4, which is also strong but doesn't give immediate check

The check with Nh3+ looks very strong as it forces the white king to move and maintains pressure.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

I can see this is an endgame position. Let me analyze what I have:

As Black, I have:
- King on h8
- Two rooks on a8 and f8
- A knight on h3
- Pawns on b7, c7, f7, g7, h7

White has:
- King on f1
- Two rooks on c3 and e1
- A bishop on a5
- Pawns on a4 and b4

The knight on h3 is in an interesting position and can create threats. Let me look for the most forcing move. The knight can go to several squares, but h3g5 looks particularly strong as it attacks the f7 square and potentially creates tactical opportunities.

However, let me also consider rook moves. The rooks could coordinate better, and f8e8 would put pressure on White's rook and potentially create back-rank tactics.

I think the most principled move is to improve my rook coordination and put pressure on White's position.

4. I have a knight on h3 that's in an advanced position
5. My pawns are mostly intact on the 7th rank

The knight on h3 is in a strong outpost position. Let me look for the most forcing move. I notice I can give check with my rook, which is often a good principle in tactical positions.

From my legal moves, I can see that Re1+ would be a powerful check, forcing the white king to move and potentially winning material or gaining a significant positional advantage.

Looking at this position, I can see that White has a rook on c3 and my king is on h8. I have two rooks - one on a8 and one on e1. This appears to be an endgame position.

Let me analyze the key features:
- My rook on e1 is very actively placed on the back rank
- White's king is on g2, somewhat exposed
- I have a knight on h3 which is well-placed near White's king
- White has a bishop on a5 and some pawns

The most forcing move I can see is to use my rook on e1 to give check and create immediate threats against White's exposed king.

Looking at this position, I can see that Black has a significant material advantage with two rooks against White's rook and bishop. My king appears to be relatively safe on h8, while White's king on f1 looks vulnerable.

I notice that White's king is on f1 and my rook on e2 is already on the second rank, which is a very strong position. Let me look for the most forcing move.

The move e2e1+ looks very promising as it would give check to the White king on f1, forcing it to move and potentially leading to a winning attack.

Looking at this position, I can see that White has a rook on c3 and my king is on h8. I have two rooks - one on a8 and one on e1, plus a knight on h3. This appears to be an endgame position.

Let me analyze the key features:
- My rook on e1 is very active on the back rank
- White's king is on g2, somewhat exposed
- I have a knight on h3 that can create threats
- White has a rook on c3 and a bishop on a5

The most forcing move I can see is to use my rook on the back rank to create immediate threats against White's king. The move **e1e2** looks very strong as it:
1. Attacks along the second rank
2. Puts pressure on White's king position
3. Potentially sets up back rank tactics

Looking at this position, I can see that I have a very strong tactical opportunity. I have two rooks - one on a8 and one on e2, and White's king is on g3 in a very exposed position.

I notice that I can deliver checkmate with my rook on e2. The White king on g3 has limited escape squares, and if I play Re3+, it will be check. Let me analyze the king's possible moves:
- The king cannot go to f2, g2, h2 (controlled by my rook on e2)
- The king cannot go to f3 (would still be in check from Re3)
- The king cannot go to h3 (occupied by White's own knight)
- The king cannot go to f4, g4, h4 (would still be in check from Re3)

This appears to be checkmate!

Let me analyze the key candidate moves:

1. **e1e4+** - This would be check, forcing the White king to move
2. **a8a4** - This would capture the White rook
3. **e1g1** - Centralizing the rook

The most forcing move appears to be **e1e4+**, which gives check and forces White's king to move from its current square. This puts immediate pressure on White and maintains the initiative.

Let me analyze the key tactical opportunities:

1. The White king on f3 is quite active but potentially vulnerable
2. I have a rook on e4 that's well-placed on the 4th rank
3. My knight on h3 can create threats
4. The rook on a8 has good mobility along the back rank

The most forcing move I see is to attack the White king directly. The rook on e4 can move to e3, giving check to the king on f3 and forcing it to move to a potentially worse square.

This appears to be an endgame position where piece activity is crucial. I notice that my rook on a8 is somewhat passive on the back rank, while White's pieces are more centralized and active.

I should look to activate my rook and create counterplay. The move that stands out to me is bringing my rook to the g-file to create threats against White's exposed king position.

Looking at this position, I can see:

- My king is on g8 and can move along the back rank
- I have a knight on h3 that's quite active and can move to several squares
- White has a rook on e5 and their king on f3
- White has a bishop on a5

The knight on h3 is in an excellent position. Let me analyze the knight moves:
- h3g5 would attack the rook on e5
- h3f4 would give check to the white king on f3
- h3f2 would also give check
- h3g1 moves the knight away from the action

Since I can give check and force White's king to move, this seems like the strongest continuation.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Looking at this endgame position, I can see:

- Black king on g8
- Black rook on f8 
- Black pawns on b7, c7, f7, g7, h7
- White king on f4
- White rook on e5
- White bishop on a5
- White pawns on a4, h5

This appears to be a rook and bishop vs rook endgame with pawns. The white king is quite active in the center, and I need to be careful about my king safety while looking for counterplay.

Let me analyze the key considerations:
1. My king on g8 is somewhat passive
2. White's rook on e5 is very active
3. I should try to activate my rook and create counterplay

The rook moves along the 8th rank could help activate my rook, particularly moving it away from defending and toward creating threats. Moving to a8 or b8 could potentially create back-rank pressure.

Looking at this position, I can see that White has a rook on e5 and their king on e4, creating some tactical pressure. My king is on h8 and I have a rook on a8. 

Let me analyze the key features:
- White's king is quite active on e4
- White has a rook on e5 that's well-placed
- My rook is somewhat passive on a8
- I need to improve my piece coordination

I think the best move here is to activate my rook and create counterplay. Moving the rook to the g-file will put pressure on White's position and give me more active piece play.

Looking at this position, I can see:

- My king is on g8 and can move along the back rank
- White has a rook on e5 that's quite active
- White's king is on e4, which is very centralized
- I have pawns on b7, c7, f7, g7, and h7

This appears to be an endgame position where White has a material advantage. My king is somewhat restricted on the back rank, and White's pieces are well-coordinated.

Let me analyze the key considerations:
1. White's king on e4 is very active
2. The White rook on e5 is controlling important squares
3. I need to try to activate my king or create counterplay with my pawns

Given that my king is currently trapped on the back rank, I should try to improve its position. Moving the king to f8 would give it more central access and potentially allow it to become more active in the position.

Looking at this endgame position, I can see:

- Black king on h8
- Black rook on f8  
- Black pawns on b7, f7, g7, h7
- White king on e5
- White rook on e6
- White bishop on c7
- White pawns on a4, b5, h5

This appears to be a complex endgame. The white king is quite active on e5, and there's a white rook on e6 that's putting pressure on my position. The white bishop on c7 is also well-placed.

I need to be careful about my king safety and look for active play with my rook. Let me consider moving my rook to create counterplay and potentially challenge White's active pieces.

make_move f8f5

This move:
1. Attacks the white king on e5, forcing it to move
2. Activates my rook on the 5th rank
3. Creates immediate threats and counterplay rather than playing passively

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

I apologize for the illegal move. Let me check the legal moves again and analyze the position more carefully.

Looking at the legal moves: h8g8,f8g8,f8e8,f8d8,f8c8,f8b8,f8a8,f7e6,h7h6,g7g6,f7f6,b7b6,g7g5,f7f5

I see that f7f5 is legal (pawn move), but f8f5 (rook move) is not, which means there must be something blocking that square or the rook's path.

Looking more carefully at the position, I notice the white rook on e6 is controlling key squares. Let me make a move that improves my position.

make_move f8d8

This move:
1. Moves my rook to the d-file, getting it to a more active square
2. Puts distance between my rook and the white rook on e6
3. Potentially prepares to challenge White's pieces from the back rank

- I have a rook on d8
- White has a rook on e6 and king on e5
- There's a white bishop on c7
- This appears to be an endgame position

The white king on e5 is quite active and centralized. I need to be careful about potential threats. Let me analyze the key candidate moves:

1. The rook moves along the d-file could be useful for activity
2. King moves to get my king more active
3. Pawn moves to create space or threats

Given that this is likely an endgame, I want to activate my pieces. Moving my rook to a more active square seems logical. The move Rd1 would put my rook on the back rank where it can be very active.

I can see this is an endgame position. Let me analyze what I have:

**Black pieces (my pieces):**
- King on h8
- Rook on d1
- Pawns on b7, f7, g7, h7

**White pieces:**
- King on e5
- Bishop on c7
- Rook on e7
- Pawns on a4, b6, h5

This looks like a complex endgame. Let me check what legal moves are available to me.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Looking at this position, I can see that White has a very active setup with the king on e5 and rook on e7, while my king is somewhat trapped on h8. Let me analyze the key candidate moves:

1. **d1d8+** - This gives check and forces the white king to move
2. **d1d5+** - Another check, directly attacking the centralized king
3. **King moves** like h8g8 to improve king safety
4. **Pawn breaks** like h7h6, g7g6, or f7f6

The most forcing moves are the checks. Let me consider d1d8+ - this forces the white king away from its strong central position and gives me the initiative.

After d1d8+, White's king will have to move (likely Kf6, Kf5, or Ke6), and this disrupts White's coordination between the king and rook.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Looking at the position, I can see:

- My king is on h8
- I have a rook on d8
- White has a rook on e7 and bishop on d6
- White's king is on e5

This appears to be an endgame position. White's rook and bishop are actively placed, and my king looks somewhat restricted. Let me analyze the key candidate moves:

1. Moving my king (h8g8) would give it more mobility
2. My rook has several options along the d-file and 8th rank

The white rook on e7 is quite active, and the bishop on d6 is well-centralized. I should look for active counterplay with my rook or improve my king position.

Given that my king is currently in the corner, improving its activity seems important. Moving to g8 would centralize it slightly and give it more escape squares.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Looking at this endgame position, I can see:

- White King on d5
- White Rook on e7  
- White Bishop on d6
- White pawns on b6, h5, and a4

- Black King on g8
- Black Rook on d8
- Black pawns on b7, f7, g7, h7

This appears to be a difficult endgame for Black. White has active pieces and is likely winning. However, I need to find the best defensive try.

The White rook on e7 is very active, and my rook on d8 is somewhat passive. I should look for ways to activate my rook or create counterplay.

Looking at my options, I think the best move is to activate my rook by moving it to the back rank where it can potentially create threats or at least improve its scope.

make_move d8a8

This move:
1. Activates my rook on the a-file
2. Gets away from potential tactics involving the White rook and bishop
3. Prepares potential counterplay against White's queenside pawns
4. Maintains flexibility for my rook's future positioning

- Black rook on a8  
- Black pawns on b7, f7, g7, h7
- White has a rook on e7, bishop on c5, king on d5, and pawns on b6, a4, h5

This appears to be an endgame position where White has a strong attacking setup with the rook on the 7th rank and the king actively placed. The white rook on e7 is very dangerous, controlling the 7th rank and limiting my king's mobility.

I need to find the most active defense. Let me consider my options:

1. Moving the rook from a8 to create counterplay
2. Moving pawns to create escape squares for my king

The most logical move seems to be to activate my rook. Moving Ra8-e8 would challenge White's rook and potentially force a trade, which would be favorable in this difficult position.

Looking at this position, I can see:

- White has a rook on e7 and king on d5
- White has a bishop on a3

This appears to be an endgame position. The white rook on e7 is quite active on the 7th rank, cutting off my king and pawns. I need to find the best way to coordinate my pieces.

Let me analyze the key candidate moves:

1. **e8e7** - This would exchange rooks, which might be favorable since I'm likely in a difficult position
2. **e8d8** or **e8c8** - Moving the rook along the back rank to potentially get more active
3. King moves like **g8f8** or **g8h8** - Improving king position

The rook exchange with **e8e7** looks very appealing here. In rook endgames, when you're under pressure, exchanging into a king and pawn endgame can sometimes offer better drawing chances, especially if the resulting pawn structure is favorable.

- Bishop on c5
- Pawns on a4, b6, h4

**Black pieces:**
- King on g8

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Looking at this position, I need to find the most effective move. I have a rook on e1 and my king is somewhat trapped on g8. White has a dangerous passed pawn on b6 that could become a serious threat.

Let me analyze the key candidate moves:

1. **e1e8+** - This gives check and forces the white king to move, potentially disrupting White's coordination
2. **e1e4** - Attacks the white king directly and centralizes my rook
3. **e1e6** - Blocks the b6 pawn's advance and keeps the rook active
4. Pawn moves like **h7h6** or **g7g6** - But these seem passive given the tactical nature of the position

The check with e1e8+ looks very strong because:
- It forces White's king to move away from the center
- It gives me tempo to reorganize my position
- After the king moves, I can potentially follow up with moves like Re6 to blockade the dangerous b6 pawn

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Looking at this endgame position, I can see:

- Black king on g8
- Black rook on e8  
- Black pawns on b7, f7, g7, h7
- White king on d5
- White bishop on c5
- White pawns on a4, b6, h5

This appears to be a rook and pawns vs bishop and pawns endgame. The white king is quite active on d5, and there's a passed pawn on b6 that could become dangerous.

I need to be careful about the white king's activity and the bishop controlling key squares. Let me activate my rook to put pressure on White's position.

make_move e8e2

This move:
1. Activates the rook on the second rank
2. Attacks from behind, which is often effective in rook endgames
3. Puts pressure on White's position and potentially targets the back rank
4. Keeps the rook active while maintaining defensive possibilities

- Bishop on b4
- Pawns on a4, b6, and h4

Black pieces:
- King on g8
- Rook on e2

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Looking at this position, I have a rook and pawns versus White's bishop and pawns. My rook is very active on e2, and I need to look for ways to create threats.

I notice that White's king is somewhat exposed on d4, and I have several interesting options:

1. I could play Re4+ to give check and force the White king to move
2. I could play Re1 to get to the back rank
3. I could advance my pawns to create counterplay

Let me play the most forcing move:

make_move e2e4

This gives check to the White king on d4, forcing it to move and allowing me to maintain the initiative with my rook.

Let me check what legal moves are available for Black.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Looking at this position, I can see that White has a king and bishop versus my king and rook, with pawns on both sides. This is generally a winning endgame for Black due to the rook's superiority over the bishop.

I notice that the White king on d5 is quite active and centralized. My rook on e4 is well-placed, but I should look for ways to improve my position.

Let me analyze the key candidate moves:

1. **e4e5+** - This gives check to the White king, forcing it to move and potentially disrupting White's coordination
2. **e4d4+** - Another check, attacking the king from a different angle
3. King moves like **g8f8** or **g8h8** - Improving king activity
4. Pawn advances like **h7h6**, **g7g6**, **f7f6** - Creating potential passed pawns

The most forcing move appears to be **e4e5+**, which gives check and forces the White king to make a decision. This maintains the initiative and keeps pressure on White's position.

**White pieces:**
- King on e4
- Bishop on c3
- Pawns on a4, b6, h4

**Black pieces:**
- King on g8
- Pawns on b7, f7, g7, h7

This appears to be a King and Bishop + pawns vs King and pawns endgame. Let me check what legal moves are available to me.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Looking at this position, I can see that White has a significant advantage with the bishop and better pawn structure. My king is somewhat trapped on the back rank, and I need to be careful about White's advancing pawns.

Let me analyze my options:

1. **g8h8** or **g8f8** - King moves along the back rank
2. **h7h6, g7g6, f7f6** - Single pawn advances
3. **g7g5, f7f5** - Double pawn advances

The key considerations:
- White's king is very active on e4
- White's b6 pawn is quite advanced and dangerous
- I need to create counterplay with my kingside pawns
- My king needs to become more active

I think the best approach is to advance my f-pawn two squares to create immediate counterplay and potentially distract White from pushing the dangerous b-pawn.

This appears to be a King and Bishop vs King and pawns endgame. My available moves are:
- King moves: g8h8, g8f7
- Pawn moves: h7h6, g7g6, f5f4, g7g5

The key strategic considerations:
1. My f5 pawn is advanced and could become dangerous
2. I need to be careful about my king safety
3. White's king is very active on e5

I think pushing the f-pawn to create counterplay is the most principled approach in this position, as it advances my most dangerous pawn and creates threats.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Looking at this endgame position, I need to assess the key factors:

1. White has a dangerous passed pawn on b6 that's very advanced
2. I have a far advanced passed pawn on f3 that could become dangerous
3. White's king and bishop are actively placed

Let me analyze the candidate moves:

- **f3f2**: This advances my passed pawn closer to promotion, creating immediate threats
- **g7g6** or **g7g5**: These moves activate my kingside pawns but seem less urgent
- **h7h6**: A waiting move that doesn't address the critical situation
- **g8f7** or **g8h8**: King moves that might help but don't create immediate counterplay

The position looks critical - White's b6 pawn is very dangerous, so I need to create maximum counterplay with my f-pawn. Advancing it to f2 puts tremendous pressure on White and forces them to deal with my promotion threat.

I can see this is an endgame position. Let me analyze what I see:

- Black King on g8
- White King on c7
- White Bishop on c3
- Black pawns on b7, g7, h7, f2
- White pawns on b6, h5, a4

This appears to be a King and Bishop vs King and pawns endgame. Let me check what legal moves are available to me.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Excellent! I can see that my f2 pawn can promote. This is a critical moment in the endgame. Let me analyze the promotion options:

- f2f1q (promote to queen) - Most powerful piece
- f2f1r (promote to rook) - Strong piece
- f2f1b (promote to bishop) - Could be useful
- f2f1n (promote to knight) - Sometimes useful for tactics

In this endgame position, promoting to a queen gives me the most powerful piece and the best winning chances. A queen can control many squares and coordinate well with my king to create threats against the white king and potentially stop the white pawns.

- White King on c7
- Black pawns on b7, g7, h7
- White pawns on a4, b6, h5
- White Bishop on e1
- Black Queen on f1

This looks like a complex endgame. Let me check what legal moves are available to me as Black.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Looking at this position, I can see that White has advanced pawns and the White king is actively placed on c7. My queen on f1 is very active and I need to use it effectively.

Let me analyze the key candidate moves:

1. **f1f8+** - This gives check to the White king, forcing it to move
2. **f1a6** - Attacks the b6 pawn 
3. **f1e1** - Attacks the White bishop
4. King moves to create escape squares

The check with f1f8+ looks very strong as it forces the White king to move and disrupts White's coordination. After the king moves, I can potentially follow up with more pressure.

Looking at this position, I can see:

- My king is on g8
- My queen is on f8 
- White's king is on c7
- White has a bishop on e1
- White has pawns on a4, b6, and h6
- I have pawns on b7, g7, and h7

This appears to be an endgame position where I have a significant material advantage with my queen. I need to look for ways to create threats against the exposed white king on c7.

Let me consider my queen moves. The white king on c7 looks vulnerable, and I can potentially create immediate threats.

make_move f8c8

This move puts my queen on the same rank as the white king, giving check and forcing the white king to move, which should help me maintain the initiative in this winning endgame position.

- Black: King on g8, Queen on c8, pawns on b7, g7, h7
- White: King on d6, Bishop on e1, pawns on b6, a4, h6

This appears to be a Queen vs Bishop endgame where Black has a significant material advantage. Let me check the available legal moves to see my options.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

I can see I have many options with my queen and some pawn moves. In this endgame position, I have a significant material advantage (Queen vs Bishop), so I should look for ways to either:

1. Create threats against the White king
2. Advance my pawns to create winning chances
3. Coordinate my pieces for a decisive attack

Looking at the position, the White king on d6 is quite active and centralized. My queen has many squares available. Let me consider some key moves:

- The pawn capture g7xh6 would eliminate White's advanced pawn and create a passed g-pawn
- Queen moves like Qc6+ would give check and force the king to move
- Qe6+ would also be a strong centralizing check

I think capturing the h6 pawn is very strong here, as it eliminates White's most advanced pawn and creates winning chances with my own passed pawns.

Looking at this position, I can see:

- My king is on g8 and appears to be in a somewhat exposed position
- I have a queen on c8 with many movement options
- White has a king on d6, a bishop on c3, and pawns on a4 and b6
- My pawns are on b7, h7, and h6

This appears to be an endgame position. With my queen having so many options, I should look for the most forcing move. Let me analyze the key candidate moves:

1. The white king on d6 looks vulnerable
2. I could give check or attack key squares
3. I need to be careful about my own king safety

The move **Qc1+** looks very strong here - it gives check to the white king on d6, forcing it to move and potentially allowing me to improve my position or win material.

Looking at this position, I can see that White has a very strong position with the king on d7 supporting the advanced pawn on b7, and my king is somewhat trapped on the back rank.

Let me analyze my three options:

1. **g8f8** - Moves my king to f8, staying on the back rank
2. **g8f7** - Moves my king to f7, coming forward to be more active
3. **h6h5** - Advances my h-pawn

In this endgame, king activity is crucial. The move Kf7 brings my king into a more active position where it can potentially help deal with White's threats or support my own pawns. Staying on f8 keeps my king passive, and while h6-h5 creates a passed pawn, my king position is more immediately important.

- f7f8: Also moves to the back rank  
- f7g6: Moves toward the kingside pawns
- h6h5: Advances my h-pawn

This appears to be a critical moment. White's bishop on d5 is controlling key squares, and the b6 pawn is very advanced. I need to be careful about White's potential threats.

The move f7g6 looks most active as it brings my king closer to support my kingside pawns and potentially creates counterplay. Moving to the back rank (g8 or f8) seems too passive and could allow White to make progress with the b-pawn.

I can see this is an endgame position with very few pieces remaining. Let me analyze what's on the board:

- White King on d8
- White Bishop on d4
- White pawns on b6 and a4
- Black King on g6
- Black pawns on b7, h7, and h6

This appears to be a critical endgame position. Let me check what legal moves are available to me.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Looking at this position, I can see that White has a dangerous passed pawn on b6 that's very close to promoting. My king is currently on g6, and I need to make a decision about whether to try to stop the pawn or improve my king position.

Let me analyze the key factors:
- White's b6 pawn is only one square away from promoting (b7 is occupied by my pawn)
- White has a bishop on d4 that can support the pawn advance
- My king on g6 is too far away to catch the b-pawn if it advances

The critical question is whether I can create counterplay or if I need to try to stop White's pawn. Given that my king is on g6 and the white pawn is on b6, I'm likely too far away to stop it directly.

However, I should try to activate my king and create the best practical chances. Moving towards the center and White's king could be the most principled approach.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Looking at this endgame position, I need to carefully consider my king placement. The white king on d7 and bishop on d4 are well-coordinated, and White has advancing pawns.

Let me analyze the options:
- f7g8 or f7f8: Moving to the back rank
- f7g6: Moving toward the kingside pawns
- h6h5: Advancing my h-pawn

In king and pawn endgames, king activity is crucial. The move f7g6 keeps my king more centralized and active, potentially supporting my h-pawn's advance while maintaining flexibility to respond to White's threats. Moving to the back rank (g8 or f8) would be more passive.

The pawn move h6h5 is also interesting as it advances my passed pawn, but king moves are typically more important in these positions.

This appears to be a critical endgame position. Let me check what legal moves are available to me as Black.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Looking at this position, I can see that White has a dangerous passed pawn on b6 that's very close to promoting. The White king on d7 is supporting this pawn's advance.

My king is currently on g6, and I need to make a decision about whether to try to stop the b-pawn or improve my king position in some other way.

Let me analyze the key candidate moves:

1. **g6f7** - Moves my king closer to the center and the White king
2. **g6h5** - Moves toward my h-pawns 
3. **g6g5** - Advances toward the center
4. **g6f5** - Centralizes the king and moves toward White's position

Given that White's b6 pawn is so advanced and supported by the king on d7, I don't think I can catch it in time. However, I should try to create counterplay with my own pawns or get my king to a more active position.

The move Kf5 (g6f5) looks most promising as it centralizes my king and potentially creates threats of my own while keeping options open.

1. White has a bishop and pawns, Black has pawns and the king
2. White's king is on d8, quite far from the action
3. My king on f5 is actively placed
4. The h-pawns could become dangerous if I can advance them

The most promising plan appears to be advancing my king toward White's pawns or supporting my own pawn advancement. Let me consider:

- Kg6 would support the h6 pawn and potentially prepare h5
- Ke6 moves toward the center and White's pawns
- Kg5 also supports the h-pawns

Given that White's king is far away on d8, I think advancing toward the kingside pawns while keeping my king active is the best approach.

Now I can see my legal moves. Looking at the position more carefully:

- My king is on f7
- I have a pawn on h6
- White has a king on c8, bishop on h8, and pawns on b7 and a4

This appears to be a king and pawn endgame with a white bishop. The white bishop on h8 is controlling the back rank, and my king has several squares available.

Let me analyze the key considerations:
1. The white king on c8 and pawn on b7 suggest White might be trying to promote
2. My king needs to stay active
3. The h6 pawn could potentially advance

Given that White has a bishop and is likely trying to promote the b7 pawn, I should try to keep my king active and centralized. Moving towards the center or towards White's pawns would be logical.

- e6f7: Advances toward White's pieces, potentially supporting pawn advancement
- e6e7: Moves up the e-file, centralizing
- e6d7: Moves toward White's king area
- e6f5: Retreats but maintains central control
- h6h5: Advances the h-pawn

Given that this is likely a race situation where both sides are trying to create threats, I think advancing my king toward the center and White's position while maintaining flexibility is best.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Looking at this endgame position, I need to be careful about White's potential threats. White has a king and bishop working together with passed pawns, which can be dangerous.

Let me analyze the key considerations:
1. White's king on b7 is supporting the b6 pawn
2. The white bishop on c3 controls important squares
3. I need to keep my king active and prevent White from making progress

The move d7e6 looks most promising because:
- It centralizes my king
- It keeps my king active and flexible
- It doesn't allow White to gain tempo or restrict my king further
- From e6, my king can potentially challenge White's advancing pawns or support my own pawns

Looking at this endgame position, I need to carefully consider my king placement. White has a dangerous passed pawn on b6 and is trying to promote it. My king is currently on e6, and I have limited options.

Let me analyze the moves:
- e6f7: Moves my king toward the kingside
- e6e7: Moves my king up the e-file
- e6f5: Moves my king toward the center/queenside
- h6h5: Advances my h-pawn

Given that White has a far-advanced passed pawn on b6 and my king needs to help stop it or create counterplay, I should move my king toward the action. The move e6f5 brings my king closer to the center and potentially toward White's dangerous pawn, while also maintaining flexibility.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Looking at this position, I can see that White has a dangerous passed pawn on b6 that's quite advanced, and my king needs to be active. Let me analyze the key candidate moves:

1. **f5g6** - Moves toward my pawns but away from the center
2. **f5e6** - Centralizes the king and potentially blocks White's king advancement
3. **f5g5** - Stays active but moves away from the queenside action
4. **f5g4** - Very aggressive, pushing toward White's pieces
5. **f5f4** - Advances down the f-file
6. **f5e4** - Attacks the bishop and centralizes
7. **h6h5** - Advances my pawn but doesn't improve king activity

The most appealing moves are **f5e4** (attacking the bishop and centralizing) and **f5g4** (staying active and potentially creating counterplay).

**f5e4** looks strongest because:
- It attacks the White bishop on c3, forcing it to move
- It centralizes my king
- It keeps my king active in this critical endgame

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Looking at this position, I need to analyze the critical endgame carefully. White has a bishop and two pawns versus my king and two pawns.

The key considerations are:
1. White's b6 pawn is very advanced and dangerous
2. My king is actively placed on e4
3. I need to either stop White's pawns or create counterplay with my h-pawns

Let me analyze the main candidate moves:

- **e4f5, e4f4, e4f3**: These moves bring my king toward White's pawns, potentially helping to blockade or attack them
- **e4d5, e4d3**: These moves also approach White's position but from a different angle
- **e4e3**: A more central retreat
- **h6h5**: Advancing my own pawn to create counterplay

Given that White's b6 pawn is very dangerous and close to promotion, I think I need to get my king involved in stopping it. The move Kf5 looks promising as it brings my king toward the queenside while maintaining good central control.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Now I can see my available moves. This is a critical endgame position where I need to be very careful. Let me analyze the situation:

White has a dangerous passed pawn on b7 that's one move away from promoting, and White's king is actively supporting it. White also has a bishop that can control key squares.

My options are:
- King moves: f5g6, f5f6, f5e6, f5g5, f5e5, f5g4, f5f4, f5e4
- Pawn moves: h7h6, h5h4

The key considerations:
1. White's b7 pawn is extremely dangerous and will promote soon
2. I need to either create counterplay with my h-pawns or try to stop White's promotion
3. My king position is crucial for both defense and creating threats

Looking at this position, I think I need to advance my h-pawn to create immediate counterplay since I cannot stop the b7 pawn from promoting. The move h5h4 creates a passed pawn and forces White to deal with my threats as well.

I can see this is an endgame position with:
- White King on b5
- White Bishop on e1
- White pawns on a6 and b6
- Black King on f5
- Black pawns on h7 and h4

Let me check what legal moves are available for Black.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Looking at this endgame position, I need to be careful about White's advanced pawns on a6 and b6. White appears to be trying to promote one of these pawns while using the king and bishop to support the advance.

My key considerations:
1. White's pawns are very advanced and dangerous
2. I need to either stop the pawns or create counterplay with my own pawns
3. My h-pawns could become dangerous if I can advance them while keeping White's king busy

The most active move appears to be advancing my h7 pawn. This creates immediate threats and forces White to consider my counterplay.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

I can see this is an endgame position with very few pieces remaining. Let me analyze what's on the board:

- White: King on b5, Bishop on g3, and two pawns on a6 and b6
- Black: King on f5 and one pawn on h4

This appears to be a critical endgame position. Let me check what legal moves are available to me as Black.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

I can see the available moves. Let me analyze this position carefully:

White has:
- King on b5
- Bishop on g3
- Pawns on a6 and b6

Black has:
- King on f5 
- Pawn on h4

This is a critical endgame. I notice that White's pawns are quite advanced and the White king is actively supporting them. My pawn on h4 is also advanced and could potentially promote.

The key tactical opportunity I see is **h4g3** - capturing the White bishop! This would be a significant material gain, removing White's only piece and leaving just the king and pawns. After capturing the bishop, I would have excellent winning chances with my king and pawn versus just White's king and pawns.

Let me take the bishop:

I can see my available moves. Looking at this position, I have a black king on f5 and pawns on h5 and g3. This is a race situation where both sides are trying to promote their pawns.

The key consideration is that my g-pawn is very advanced (on g3) and close to promotion. White's pawns on a6 and b6 are also advanced, but my g-pawn appears to be faster.

The critical move here is to push my g-pawn to g2, getting it one step closer to promotion and creating a serious threat.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Looking at this position, I have a powerful queen against White's advanced pawns. The White pawns on a6 and b6 are quite dangerous and close to promotion, so I need to deal with them quickly.

I can see that my queen can capture the b6 pawn with check, which would be very strong. Let me analyze:

If I play Qxb6+, this:
1. Captures one of White's dangerous passed pawns
2. Gives check to the White king on a3
3. Forces the White king to move, likely giving me time to deal with the remaining a6 pawn

This looks like the most forcing and effective move.

Looking at the position, the white king on b3 is somewhat exposed. I should look for ways to restrict the white king's movement and potentially create mating threats.

Let me play a move that centralizes my queen and puts pressure on the white king:

make_move a6d3

This move:
1. Centralizes the queen on a strong square
2. Controls important squares around the white king
3. Keeps the white king restricted to the queenside
4. Maintains flexibility for future tactical shots

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Looking at this position, I have a significant material advantage with my queen and pawn against the lone white king. The white king is somewhat trapped on a4, and I need to systematically force checkmate.

Let me analyze the key candidate moves:
- Queen moves that give check and restrict the white king
- King moves that support the advance and help in the mating net
- Pawn advances when safe

The move **d3a3+** looks very strong here because:
1. It gives check to the white king on a4
2. It forces the king to move to very limited squares
3. It brings my queen closer to deliver mate

This check will force the white king to move, likely to b4 or b5, after which I can continue to restrict its movement and work toward checkmate.

I can see I have moves with both my king and my h-pawn. In this king and pawn endgame, I need to carefully coordinate my pieces to promote the pawn.

Looking at the position:
- My king is on f5, well-placed to support the h-pawn
- The white king is far away on a3
- My h-pawn is on h5 and can advance

The key principle here is to advance the pawn while keeping my king in support. Since the white king is so far away, I should be able to promote this pawn.

I can see I have a black king on f5 and a black pawn on h4. This is a king and pawn endgame where I need to promote my h-pawn while keeping the white king at bay.

In king and pawn endgames, the key principles are:
1. Push the pawn when the opposing king is far away
2. Use the king to support the pawn's advance
3. Try to get the king in front of the pawn when possible

The white king is on b2, which is quite far from my h-pawn. This gives me a good opportunity to advance the pawn. I should push it to h3 to get closer to promotion.

- The White king on a2 is too far away to stop the pawn
- I should push the pawn immediately since it's unstoppable

I can see I have many options with both my king and queen. In a Queen vs King endgame, the key is to systematically restrict the enemy king's movement and drive it toward the edge of the board for checkmate.

The white king is currently on b2, already near the edge. I should look for moves that either give check or further restrict the white king's escape squares.

Looking at the position, I can give check with my queen from h1. Let me play:

make_move h1b1

This move gives check to the white king on b2, forcing it to move and further restricting its position along the edge of the board.

- 'get_legal_moves' to get a UCI formatted list of available moves
- 'make_move <UCI formatted move>' when you are ready to complete your turn (e.g., 'make_move e2e4')

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Now I can see my available moves. Looking at the position, White has aggressively placed a knight on e5 early in the game. This is a central outpost, but it can also become a target.

I have several good options:
1. d7-d6 - attacks the knight on e5 and opens up my position
2. Nf6-d5 - centralizes my knight and attacks White's pieces
3. Nb8-c6 - develops my knight and puts pressure on the e5 knight

I think the most principled move here is to attack the knight on e5 with a pawn move, forcing White to make a decision about this piece.

I can see the current position. It looks like we're in the early opening phase where:
- White has played Nf3 and the knight is on e5
- Black's knight from b8 has moved to f6
- There's a pawn missing from d7 (likely moved to d6)
- White is missing a knight from g1 (the one now on e5)

Let me check what legal moves are available to me as Black.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Now I can see all my legal moves. Looking at the position, White has a knight aggressively placed on e5, which is quite centralized and strong. I need to address this.

I notice that my knight on f6 can capture the white knight on e5 with Nxe5 (f6e4 in the move list appears to be the knight taking something, but I see f6d5, f6g4, f6e4 - let me look more carefully).

Actually, looking at the legal moves, I see "d6e5" which would be my d6 pawn capturing the knight on e5. This would be an excellent move as it:
1. Removes White's strong centralized knight
2. Advances my pawn to a central square
3. Opens up my position

I can see this is an early opening position. White has played h4 (pawn to h4) and I have a knight on f6. This appears to be after moves like 1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.h4 Nf6.

White's h4 move is quite unusual and aggressive in the opening. I should focus on solid development and controlling the center. Let me develop my pieces harmoniously.

I'll play Nc6 to develop my knight and put pressure on the center, specifically targeting the d4 and e5 squares.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Looking at the position, I can see that White has developed some pieces and pushed a pawn to h4. I have several good options available. Let me analyze the key features:

1. White's king is still in the center
2. I have both knights developed to active squares (c6 and f6)
3. My bishops are still on their starting squares
4. White has pushed h4, which could be part of a kingside attack

I think developing my dark-squared bishop would be a good move here. The bishop can go to several squares, but I particularly like the idea of putting pressure on White's position.

make_move c8g4

This move:
- Develops my dark-squared bishop to an active square
- Pins White's queen to the king (if there's a queen on d1)
- Puts pressure on White's position
- Prepares for potential tactics involving the pin

- I have a bishop actively placed on g4
- My knights are well-positioned on c6 and f6
- White's king appears to still be in the center

Looking at the available moves, I notice several tactical possibilities. The bishop on g4 is well-placed and putting pressure on White's position. I also see that my knight on f6 has some interesting options.

Let me make a move that increases pressure and improves my position:

make_move f6e4

This knight move centralizes my knight to an excellent outpost on e4, where it will be very active and put pressure on White's position while potentially supporting future tactical ideas.

Looking at this position, I can see that White has developed their queen to d2 and has some pieces active. I have two knights well-placed on c6 and e4, and my bishop is on g4. Let me look for the most forcing and effective move.

I notice that my knight on e4 is very well-placed in the center, and my knight on c6 has several good options. The position looks like it's from an opening where I should continue developing and creating threats.

One strong option that catches my eye is **Nd4**, moving my knight from c6 to d4. This would:
1. Centralize the knight on an excellent outpost
2. Attack White's queen on d2
3. Control important central squares
4. Force White to respond to the threat

Player_Black (to Proxy):

I can see this is an interesting middlegame position. Let me analyze what I'm seeing:

- White has developed pieces actively with knights on d4 and e4, and the queen is centralized on d2
- I have two knights actively placed on d4 and e4, and my bishop is on g4
- White's king appears to still be in the center on e1
- I have castling rights available (h8g8 is in my legal moves)

Given that White's king is still uncastled and in a potentially vulnerable position, I should look for tactical opportunities. My knights are very well-placed, and I notice I have some interesting possibilities.

Let me make a move that increases pressure on White's position:

make_move g4e2

This move forks the White king and queen with my bishop, which should win material since the White king will be in check and must move, allowing me to capture the queen on the next move.

Looking at this position, I can see:

1. White has both knights actively placed on d4 and e4 in the center
2. My king is still on e8 and hasn't castled
3. I have a bishop on e2 that's quite active
4. White's queen is centralized on d3

I need to address the central pressure from White's knights. Let me make a move that challenges one of them while developing my position.

make_move e2f3

This move:
- Attacks the knight on e4
- Develops my bishop to a more active square
- Puts pressure on White's kingside
- Forces White to deal with the threat to the knight

Looking at this position, I can see that White has developed their pieces actively with knights on d4 and e4, and their queen is centralized on d3. My pieces are still mostly on their starting squares, but I have good opportunities to develop and create counterplay.

Let me analyze the key features:
- White has two knights in strong central positions (d4 and e4)
- My king is still in the center and needs safety
- I have development opportunities with my pieces
- The position looks like it could be from a Scandinavian Defense or similar opening

I think the most logical move here is to develop my bishop and attack the knight on e4, while also preparing to castle kingside.

Looking at the position, I can see that White has developed their pieces actively with knights on d4 and e4, and their queen is centralized on d2. My king is still in the center and needs safety. Let me analyze the key features:

1. My king on e8 is still uncastled and potentially vulnerable
2. White has two well-placed knights putting pressure on my position
3. I have knights on d4 and e4 which are well-centralized
4. White's king on e1 is also uncastled

I should prioritize king safety while maintaining my active piece play. Castling queenside looks like a good option to get my king to safety while connecting my rooks.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

I see there was an error with my move notation. Let me look at the legal moves again more carefully. I notice that castling queenside should be possible, but it would be notated as a king move from e8 to c8. However, since that move failed, let me check if there are any pieces or attacks preventing castling.

Looking at the position again and the legal moves provided, I can see several good options. Let me make a strong developing move that improves my position:

make_move d8d6

This move:
1. Develops my queen to a more active square
2. Supports my advanced pawn on e4 (wait, I see the knight is on e4)
3. Prepares to potentially castle later
4. Keeps pressure on White's position

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Looking at this position, I can see that White has just played what appears to be an aggressive setup with pieces on f3 and e2, and my king is still in the center on e8. I have two knights actively placed on d4 and e4, which gives me good central control.

Let me analyze some key candidate moves:

1. **e8c8** - Castling queenside to get my king to safety
2. **d4e6** or **d4c6** - Advancing the knight from d4 to attack pieces
3. **e4f6+** - Knight fork giving check and attacking pieces
4. **d6d5** - Advancing the queen to a more active square

The most pressing concern is king safety. With White's pieces actively placed and my king still on e8, castling queenside looks very appealing to get my king to safety while connecting my rooks.

2. I have two strong knights in the center (d4 and e4)
3. White's king looks somewhat exposed on e1
4. White has a rook on g3 that might be vulnerable

I notice that my knight on e4 can capture something on f2, which would be a fork attacking the king and potentially winning material. Let me check this tactical shot:

make_move e4f2

This move puts the knight on f2, giving check to the White king on e1, and also attacks the rook on g3. This is a classic knight fork that should win material.

Looking at this position, I can see that White has just played what appears to be an aggressive setup with the Queen on d3 and a Rook on g6. I need to assess the tactical situation carefully.

Let me analyze the key features:
- My King is on c8, somewhat exposed
- White has a Rook on g6 which could be creating threats
- I have a Queen on d6 and knights on d4 and f2 that are well-placed
- The knight on f2 is particularly active, close to White's king

The knight on f2 is in an excellent position and can create immediate threats. Let me look at the move f2e4, which would:
1. Attack the White Queen on d3
2. Centralize my knight further
3. Create tactical complications

This looks like the most forcing and promising continuation.

Looking at this position, I can see that White has a rook on g6 that appears to be in an aggressive position. I have two knights on d4 and e4 that are well-centralized and can create threats.

Let me analyze the key features:
- White's king is on e1 (uncastled)
- White has a queen on f6 and rook on g6 creating pressure
- My knights on d4 and e4 are actively placed
- My queen on d6 is centralized

I notice that I can play **Nf2+** with the knight from e4, which would be a fork - giving check to the White king on e1 while simultaneously attacking the White queen on f6. This is a powerful tactical shot that wins material.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Looking at this position, I can see that White has just played a move that puts my king in a precarious position. Let me analyze the key features:

1. My king is on c8, and White has a rook on g6 that's quite active
2. I have a queen on d6 that's well-centralized
3. I have knights on d4 and f2 that are both very well-placed, especially the knight on f2 which is deep in White's territory
4. White's king is on e1, still in the center

The knight on f2 is in an excellent attacking position. Let me look for a strong tactical move with it.

I notice that from f2, my knight can go to e4, which would:
- Attack the bishop on f3
- Control important central squares
- Maintain pressure on White's position

However, let me also consider d4c2+, which would be check and fork the king and rook! But I don't see a rook that would be forked... 

Wait, let me look more carefully at knight moves. The knight on d4 can go to c2, and if that's check, it would be very strong.

Actually, looking at the position again, I think the most forcing move is with my knight on f2. Let me play:

make_move f2e4

This attacks the bishop on f3 and centralizes my knight powerfully, maintaining strong pressure on White's position.

The knight on e4 to f2 would give check to the white king on e1, and this appears to be a strong tactical shot.

Looking at this position, I can see that White has a rook on g4 that appears to be somewhat active, and there's a bishop on c6. My king is on c8 and I have several pieces that can create threats.

Let me analyze the key candidate moves:

1. **d4e6** - This knight move attacks the bishop on c6 and centralizes the knight
2. **d4c6** - This would capture the white bishop directly
3. **d6d5** - Advancing the queen to a more central square
4. **f2e4** - The other knight can jump to a strong central square

The most forcing move appears to be capturing the bishop on c6. This wins material immediately and removes a well-placed white piece.

Looking at this position, I can see that White's king is on e1 and appears to be in a somewhat exposed position. I notice I have a queen on d6 and knights on c6 and f2. The knight on f2 is particularly well-placed, being deep in White's territory.

Let me analyze some key tactical possibilities:

1. The knight on f2 can give check with Ng4+ or Ne4+
2. My queen on d6 has good central control
3. White's king looks vulnerable

I think the most forcing move here is to give check with the knight, which will disrupt White's position and potentially create tactical opportunities.

Looking at the position, I can see that White has a rook on g5 that appears to be somewhat active, and my king is on c8. I have several pieces that can contribute to the position - my queen on d6, knights on c6 and e4, and my rooks.

Let me analyze some key candidate moves:

1. My knight on e4 is well-placed and has several good squares
2. My queen on d6 is centralized and active
3. I should look for tactical opportunities

The knight on e4 can go to several strong squares. Let me consider e4f6+ - this would be a check, forcing the White king to move and potentially disrupting White's coordination.

Looking at the White king on e1, a knight check from f6 would be quite strong, forcing the king to move and giving me tempo.

Looking at this position, I can see that White has a rook on g5 that appears to be somewhat active. Let me analyze the key features:

1. My king is on c8, somewhat exposed
2. White's king is on e2, also in the center
3. I have active pieces - my queen on d6 and knights on c6 and f6
4. White has a rook on g5 that could be creating threats

I notice that my knight on f6 has several good options. Let me look for the most forcing move that improves my position.

The move **f6e4** stands out because:
- It centralizes my knight to an excellent outpost on e4
- From e4, the knight attacks multiple squares and puts pressure on White's position
- It's a natural developing move that improves my piece coordination

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Looking at this position, I can see that White has just played Rg4, likely attacking my knight on e4. Let me analyze the key features:

1. My king is on c8, somewhat exposed
2. I have a knight on e4 that appears to be under attack
3. My queen is actively placed on d6
4. White's king is on e2, also somewhat exposed

The knight on e4 is in a strong central position, and I should look for ways to either defend it effectively or use it tactically. Let me examine the knight moves:

- e4f6: Retreats but keeps the knight active
- e4d2+: This would be check, forking the king and potentially winning material
- e4c3: Attacks pawns and stays centralized
- e4f2: Attacks but might be less secure

The move e4d2+ looks very promising as it gives check to the White king on e2, and knights giving check often create tactical opportunities.

I notice that my queen on d6 has several powerful options. Let me look for the most forcing moves first.

I can see that my queen can move to d4, which would be a strong central square, or d2 which would give check to the white king on e2. The check looks very promising as it forces White's response.

2. I have knights on c6 and e4 that are well-positioned
3. White's king on e2 looks somewhat vulnerable
4. The rook on g5 is attacking, but I can potentially counter-attack

I notice that my knight on e4 has some excellent tactical possibilities. Let me look at the move **e4f2** - this would be a knight fork, attacking both the White king on e2 and potentially creating threats.

However, let me also consider **d6d2+** - this would be a check with my queen, forcing the White king to move and potentially winning material or gaining a strong initiative.

Wait, looking more carefully at the legal moves, I don't see d6d2+ listed, so that square must be defended or blocked.

The knight move **e4f2** looks very strong as it would fork the king and potentially other pieces, creating immediate tactical threats.

However, I also see that my queen on d6 has some powerful options. Let me consider Qd3, which would centralize the queen even more and put pressure on White's position.

But the most forcing move appears to be with the knight. Ne4+ looks like it gives check to the White king on f3, which would be very strong.

Looking at this position, I can see that White has a rook on g5 that appears to be quite active. Let me analyze the key features:

1. My king is on c8, somewhat exposed
2. I have a powerful queen on d6 in the center
3. White's rook on g5 is putting pressure on my position
4. I have knights on c6 and f2 that could be useful

The knight on f2 is in a very advanced position and can create threats. Let me look for the most forcing moves.

I notice that my knight on f2 can move to e4, which would:
- Centralize the knight powerfully
- Attack potential weak squares
- Support my central control

However, I also see that my knight can go to d3, which might be even stronger as it would:
- Attack from a central outpost
- Potentially support tactics with my queen
- Control key central squares

Let me play the most active move:

Looking at this position, I can see that White's king is somewhat exposed on g4, and I have some active pieces. Let me analyze the key features:

1. White's king on g4 is in an advanced and potentially vulnerable position
2. I have a queen on d6 that's well-centralized
3. I have knights on c6 and e4 that are actively placed
4. White has a rook on g5 that might be defending the king

I notice that my knight on e4 can move to f2, which would be a powerful fork, checking the White king on g4 and potentially attacking other pieces. Let me examine this move more carefully:

If I play Ne4-f2, this would give check to the king on g4, and the king would be forced to move. This looks like a strong tactical shot.

1. My queen on d6 is very actively placed and has many options
2. White's king on h4 looks somewhat exposed
3. I have knights on c6 and f2 that could create tactical opportunities

The knight on f2 is particularly well-placed and can create threats. Let me look for the most forcing moves.

I notice that my knight on f2 can move to e4, which would:
- Centralize the knight powerfully
- Attack the white rook on g5 (if I'm reading the position correctly)
- Create potential tactical threats against the exposed white king

2. I have a queen on d6 which is very active
3. I have knights on c6 and e4 which are well-placed
4. White has a rook on g5 and their king on h3

Looking at the position, I notice that my knight on e4 is very well-placed and can create threats. Let me look for the most forcing moves.

The knight on e4 can go to several squares, and I see that e4f2 would be a powerful move, as it would fork the king on h3 and potentially create serious threats.

However, let me also consider my queen on d6, which has many options. The move d6d4 looks interesting as it centralizes the queen further.

But the most forcing and tactical move appears to be with the knight. The move e4f2 would be a knight fork, attacking the king and potentially winning material.

2. My queen on d6 is centralized and has many options

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Let me analyze this position. I can see that:

1. My king is on c8 and appears to be in a somewhat exposed position
2. I have a queen on d6 which is very active and centralized
3. White has a rook on g5 that could be threatening
4. I have knights on c6 and h5 that can create tactical opportunities

Looking at the available moves, I notice some interesting tactical possibilities. The knight on h5 can move to f6 or f4, and my queen on d6 has many options.

Let me look for the most forcing move. I see that my knight on h5 can go to f4, which would be a strong central square and could create threats. Alternatively, Qd4 with my queen could be very strong, centralizing it even more and potentially creating threats.

However, I notice that Qd4 looks particularly appealing as it centralizes my queen on a dominant square and could create multiple threats.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Let me analyze this position. I can see that:

1. My king is on c8 and appears to be in a somewhat exposed position
2. I have a powerful queen on d4 in the center
3. White has rooks on g5 and a7, and their king is on h7
4. I have knights on c6 and h5

Looking at the position, my queen on d4 is very well-placed and I should look for tactical opportunities. I notice that White's king on h7 looks vulnerable, and I have several pieces that could potentially create threats.

Let me examine some key candidate moves:

1. **d4d7** - This attacks the rook on d8... wait, that's my own rook, so this isn't right
2. **d4g4** - This move puts pressure on White's position and potentially threatens the king
3. **h5f6** - The knight move could be strong, potentially forking or creating threats
4. **d4e3** - Advancing the queen closer to White's king

Looking more carefully at the position, I think **d4g4** looks very promising as it puts my queen on an aggressive square, potentially threatening White's king and maintaining central control.

Looking at this position, I can see that I'm Black and have several pieces actively placed. Let me analyze the key features:

1. My queen on g4 is very actively placed in the center
2. I have knights on c6 and h5 that can create threats
3. White's king appears to be on g7, which seems exposed
4. I have rooks on d8 and h8

Let me look for the most forcing moves. I notice my queen on g4 has many options, and my knights can potentially create threats.

The move that stands out is using my knight on h5 to attack. The move h5f6+ would be a knight fork, giving check to the white king on g7 while potentially attacking other pieces.

Wait, let me reconsider the board orientation. Looking more carefully at the position and the available moves, I should focus on the most aggressive continuation.

My queen on g4 is well-placed, and I can see that g4g2 might be a strong move, potentially threatening the white king's safety.

However, looking at knight moves, h5f6 appears to give check and create immediate threats.

1. My king is on c8 with rooks on d8 and h8
2. I have knights on c6 and f6 that are well-placed
3. White has rooks on e7 and g4, with the king on h7

I notice that my knight on f6 has several good options. One particularly attractive move is **Nd5**, which would centralize my knight powerfully and potentially create threats against White's position.

The knight on d5 would:
- Control important central squares
- Potentially support future tactical ideas
- Be well-protected and difficult to dislodge

One particularly strong move catches my eye: my knight on d5 can go to e3, which would be a powerful centralized square that forks the white king on h7 and potentially creates tactical threats.

Let me examine this more carefully - Ne3 would put my knight in a very strong central position and could create immediate threats.

Let me analyze this position. I can see that:

1. My king is on c8, somewhat exposed
2. I have rooks on d8 and h8
3. I have knights on c6 and f5 that are well-placed
4. White has a rook on g4 and another on e1
5. White's king is on h7

Looking at the position, I notice that White's king on h7 appears to be in a vulnerable position. My knight on f5 is very well-placed and can create threats.

Let me look for tactical opportunities. The knight on f5 can move to several squares, and I notice that f5-g3 would be a powerful move, potentially creating threats against White's exposed king and attacking the rook on e1.

Looking at this position, I can see that White has a rook on g4 that appears to be somewhat active, and my king is on c8. I have two knights on c6 and g3, with the knight on g3 being quite active in White's territory.

Let me analyze some key candidate moves:

1. The knight on g3 has several interesting options, including Nge2+ which would be check, or Nge4 centralizing the knight
2. My rook on d8 could become more active
3. I should consider king safety

The knight on g3 is in a very strong position. Let me play:

make_move g3e2

This move puts the knight on e2, giving check to the White king on g7, and the knight will be well-centralized from e2, controlling important squares and potentially creating tactical opportunities.

2. I have rooks on d8 and h8
3. There's a knight on c6 
4. White has rooks on g4 and e7, and their king is on h7

Looking at the position, White's rook on e7 is quite active and my king position looks vulnerable. I need to improve my king safety.

The move that stands out to me is moving my king to safety. Let me play:

make_move c8b8

This gets my king away from the center files where White's rooks are active, moving it toward the queenside where it should be safer.

2. White's king is on h4, which appears somewhat exposed

The most striking feature is my rook on d3, which is on the third rank and very active. I should look for ways to create threats against White's somewhat exposed king.

Let me consider the move **d3d1**, which would put my rook on the back rank. This creates immediate threats and forces White to deal with back rank pressure.

- My rook on d8 is actively placed
- I have a knight on c6 that can move to several squares
- White has rooks on e3 and g4, with the king on h4
- My king position on b8 seems relatively safe for now

I notice that my knight on c6 has several good options. Let me consider moving it to d4, which would centralize it and potentially create threats against White's position.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Looking at this position, I can see that White has a very active setup with rooks on e4 and g4, and my king looks somewhat exposed. I have a knight on d4 which is well-centralized, and I need to find a good move.

Let me analyze the key candidate moves:

1. **d4e6** - This centralizes my knight further and attacks some key squares
2. **d4c6** - Moves the knight to a solid outpost
3. **d4f5** - Attacks the bishop on f6 and creates threats
4. **d4e2** - A very aggressive move, forking potential targets

The move **d4e2** looks particularly interesting as it's a knight fork that could create serious threats against White's pieces. Let me examine this more carefully - from e2, the knight would be attacking multiple squares and potentially forking pieces.

However, **d4f5** also catches my attention as it directly attacks the white bishop on f6, forcing it to move and potentially disrupting White's coordination.

I think the most forcing move here is:

1. My king is on b8 and appears to be in a somewhat exposed position
2. I have a rook on d8 and h8
3. I have a bishop on f8
4. I have a knight on f5 which is well-placed in the center
5. White has pieces that look threatening, including a rook on g4 and bishop on f4

Looking at the knight on f5, it's in an excellent central position. I notice I can move it to several squares, and one move that stands out is Nh4, which would attack White's rook on g4 and potentially create tactical opportunities.

Let me make this move:

4. I have a knight on h4 that could be quite active
5. White has a bishop on g5

Looking at the knight on h4, it has some interesting tactical possibilities. The move h4g2 would be a knight fork, attacking both the white king on h3 and potentially other pieces. Let me examine this more carefully.

The white king appears to be on h3, and if I play Ng2+, this would be check while also potentially attacking other pieces.

5. White's king is on h3

Looking at the legal moves, I notice I have a knight on e3 which has many possible moves. This knight is very actively placed and could be causing problems for White.

Let me look for the most forcing moves. The knight on e3 has several interesting options:
- e3f5 (attacking something)
- e3d5 (centralizing)
- e3f1, e3d1 (back rank moves)

Given the position of White's king on h3 and the active placement of my knight, I think e3f1 could be very strong as it attacks along the back rank and potentially sets up tactical threats.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Looking at this position, I can see that White has a very active setup with rooks on f6 and f4, creating significant pressure. My king on b8 appears to be in a precarious position, and I need to address the immediate threats.

Let me analyze the key features:
- White has doubled rooks on the f-file
- My king on b8 is somewhat exposed
- White has a knight on a3 and bishop on g5
- I have a rook on d8 and h8, knight on g3, and several pawns

The most pressing concern is improving my king safety. Moving my king to a safer square seems like the priority.

make_move d8c8

This move:
1. Gets my rook off the dangerous d-file where it could be attacked
2. Prepares to potentially castle queenside or move my king to b7
3. Keeps my rook active and connected to my other pieces
4. Avoids any immediate tactical shots from White's aggressive piece placement

Let me analyze this position. I can see that:

1. My king is on b8 and appears to be in a somewhat precarious position
2. I have rooks on a8 and h8
3. White has rooks on f6 and f4, which are very active
4. White's king is on h4
5. I have a knight on g3 which is well-placed and has many options

Looking at the position, my knight on g3 is in an excellent outpost and I should look for tactical opportunities. Let me examine the knight moves:

- g3e4 would centralize the knight further
- g3e2 could be interesting, getting closer to White's king area
- g3f5 attacks the rook on f6
- g3h5+ would be check, forcing the White king to move

The move g3h5+ looks very promising as it gives check and forces White's king to move, potentially improving my position.

1. White's rook on f6 is very active and putting pressure on my position
2. My king on b8 needs safety
3. I have a knight on h5 that could be useful
4. My rooks on c8 and h8 need better coordination

I notice that White's king on h4 is quite exposed. My knight on h5 can potentially create threats. Let me consider the move **h5f4**, which would:
- Attack White's rook on g4 with check (since the White king is on h4)
- Force White to deal with the immediate threat
- Improve my knight's position

This looks like a strong tactical shot.

Looking at this position, I can see that White has two rooks on the f-file (f6 and f4) creating significant pressure. My king on b8 appears to be in a precarious position, and I need to improve my king safety.

Let me analyze the key features:
- White has doubled rooks on the f-file
- My king on b8 looks vulnerable 
- I have a rook on h8 and c8 that could potentially coordinate better
- White's king on h4 also looks somewhat exposed

From my legal moves, I think the most logical choice is to improve my king position by moving it away from the dangerous b-file and toward the center where it might be safer.

Let me analyze the key features:

- White has doubled rooks on the f-file
- My rook on d8 is my most active piece
- I need to find a way to create counterplay or improve my king safety

The move **d8d1** looks very appealing as it:
1. Activates my rook to the back rank
2. Creates immediate threats against White's exposed king on g5
3. Forces White to deal with back rank pressure
4. Gives me counterplay in what appears to be a difficult position

I can see this is an endgame position where I'm playing as Black. Let me analyze the key features:

- My king is on b8
- I have a rook on h8 and another rook on d1
- I have a bishop on f8
- White has a king on g4, two rooks on f6 and f5, a bishop on g5, and a knight on a3

The position looks quite active for Black. My rook on d1 is very well placed on the back rank, and I notice White's king is somewhat exposed on g4.

Let me look for the most forcing moves. I can give check with my rook on d1 by moving it along the first rank or the d-file. The move **d1d4** looks particularly interesting as it would give check to the White king on g4 and force it to move.

Let me analyze this position. I can see that:

1. I have a rook on d4 that's very active in the center
2. My king is on b8 
3. I have a bishop on f8
4. Another rook on h8
5. Several pawns on the 7th and 5th ranks

Looking at the legal moves, I notice that my rook on d4 has many options. Let me look for tactical opportunities:

- The rook can move to d1, which would be on the back rank
- It can also move horizontally along the 4th rank
- I can also consider pawn moves or moving my other pieces

Given that my rook is very well-placed on d4 and I can see White has pieces that might be vulnerable, I'll play a move that maintains pressure and improves my position.

make_move d4d1

This move puts my rook on the back rank, which is often a powerful position that can create threats and control important squares.

Looking at the position, I can see:

- My king is on b8
- I have rooks on h8 and d1
- I have a bishop on f8
- White has rooks on f6 and f3, a bishop on g5, a knight on a3, and king on g3
- There's a black pawn on e5 and several other pawns

This appears to be an endgame position. Let me analyze the most promising moves:

1. The rook on d1 has many options along the first rank and d-file
2. I could potentially create threats or improve my piece coordination

Looking at the position, I notice that White's king on g3 might be vulnerable. My rook on d1 can move to d3 to give check and force the white king to move, which could improve my position.

Looking at this position, I can see that White's king is on g3 and appears to be in a somewhat exposed position. I have a rook on d3 that's actively placed, and I notice White has rooks on f6 and f3.

Let me analyze the key features:
- My king is on b8
- I have a rook on d3 that can move along the rank or file
- I have a rook on h8
- White's king on g3 looks potentially vulnerable

I'm particularly interested in the move d3d1, which would put my rook on the back rank and could create threats. This move activates my rook powerfully and puts pressure on White's position.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Looking at this position, I can see that:

1. My king is on b8 and appears to be in a somewhat exposed position
2. I have a rook on d8 that has good mobility
3. White has rooks on f6 and e3, and their king is on g3
4. The position looks like an endgame with limited material

Let me analyze the key candidate moves:

- **d8d1**: This move puts my rook on the back rank, which could be very strong for creating threats and controlling important squares
- **d8d3**: This challenges White's rook on e3 directly
- **h8g8**: This moves my king toward the center/safety
- **e5e4**: This advances my passed pawn

The move **d8d1** looks very appealing because:
- It activates my rook to its maximum potential on the back rank
- It creates immediate threats against White's exposed king
- It improves my piece coordination significantly

- Bishop on f8
- Rook on h8
- Rook on d3
- Pawns on a7, c7, e7, g7, h7, and e5

I notice that my rook on d3 is very actively placed and has many movement options. The white king appears to be on g3, and there are white pieces including rooks on f5 and e3, a bishop on g5, and a knight on a3.

Given the active position of my rook on d3, I should look for tactical opportunities. I notice that my rook can move to d1, which would be a very strong move - it would place the rook on the back rank and potentially create threats against the white king.

Looking at this position, I can see that:

1. My king is on b8 and can move to b7
2. I have a rook on h8 that can move to g8
3. I have a rook on d1 with many movement options
4. I have several pawn moves available
5. White has a rook on f5 and c3, a bishop on g5, a knight on a3, and their king on g3

The most striking feature is that I have a rook on d1 (the back rank), which is very active. I notice that White's king is on g3, which looks somewhat exposed.

Let me look for the most forcing move. With my rook on d1, I can give check by moving it to d3, attacking the king on g3.

- I have a rook on h8
- I have a bishop on f8
- White's king is on h5
- White has rooks on f5 and c3, and a bishop on g5

The position looks quite tactical. My rook on d3 is very well-placed and has many options. Let me look for the most forcing move.

I notice that White's king on h5 is somewhat exposed. I can give check with my rook from d3 by moving it to h3, which would force the White king to move and maintain pressure.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Looking at the position, I can see that White has a rook on c3 and another rook on f2, along with a knight on a3, bishop on g5, and king on h3. My king is on b7 and I have a rook on h8, bishop on f8, and several pawns.

This appears to be an endgame position where I need to be careful about my king safety. Let me analyze the key candidate moves:

1. **b7c8** - Moving my king to c8 gets it away from the center and potential rook attacks
2. **e5e4** - Advancing my passed pawn could be strong
3. **h8g8** - Moving the rook along the back rank

The most pressing concern is king safety. My king on b7 looks somewhat exposed to the white rooks. Moving to c8 would put my king in the corner but also get it away from the active white pieces.

However, I also notice I have a passed pawn on e5 that could advance to e4, which might create counterplay.

Let me go with the king move to improve safety first:

Looking at this position, I can see:

- My king is on c8 and appears to be in some danger with White's rooks on f6 and c3
- White has a knight on a3 and bishop on g5
- I have a rook on h8, bishop on f8, and several pawns
- White has advanced pawns on b5 and c5, and I have a pawn on e5

The position looks quite tactical. Let me analyze the key candidate moves:

1. **e5e4** - This advances my central pawn and could be strong
2. **King moves** (c8d8, c8b8, c8d7, c8b7) - Getting my king to safety
3. **Rook moves** (h8g8) - Activating my rook

Given that my king looks exposed and White has active pieces, I think advancing the central pawn to create counterplay is the most principled approach. The pawn advance e5-e4 gains space in the center and could help create tactical opportunities.

Looking at this position, I can see that White has active pieces with rooks on c3 and f3, and my king on c8 is somewhat exposed. I have a few key considerations:

1. My king safety - the king on c8 is on the back rank with limited escape squares
2. The advanced white pawn on e4 that I can potentially capture with e4e3
3. My rook on h8 and bishop on f8 are somewhat passive

The most forcing and beneficial move appears to be capturing the white pawn on e4. This:
- Wins material (a pawn)
- Advances my pawn toward promotion
- Creates counterplay in the center

Looking at this position, I can see that White has a rook on c3 and my king is on c8. I have a rook on h8 and a bishop on f8. There's also a black pawn on e3 that's quite advanced.

Let me analyze the key candidate moves:

1. **e3e2** - This advances my passed pawn to the 2nd rank, creating a serious promotion threat
2. **h8g8** or other king moves - To improve king safety
3. **c8d7/b7** - King moves to get off the back rank

The pawn on e3 advancing to e2 looks very strong as it creates an immediate promotion threat that White will have to deal with. This forces White into a defensive position.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

I can see this is an endgame position where I have a significant advantage. Looking at the board, I have:
- King on c8
- Bishop on f8  
- Rook on h8
- Several pawns
- A very advanced pawn on e2 that can promote!

The most powerful move available is to promote my pawn on e2. I should promote to a queen for maximum material advantage.

Looking at this position, I can see that White has a queen on e1 that's very active and centralized, along with rooks on c3 and h3, and a knight on a3. My king on c8 appears to be in a somewhat precarious position.

Let me analyze the key features:
- White's queen on e1 is dominating the center
- My king on c8 needs safety
- I have a rook on h8 and bishop on f8
- White has advanced pawns on b5 and c5

I think the most logical move is to improve my king's safety by moving it away from the exposed c8 square. Moving to d8 or b8 would centralize or decentralize the king respectively.

Let me analyze this position. I can see that:

1. My king is on d8 and appears to be in a somewhat exposed position
2. I have a queen on e1 which is very actively placed
3. White has a king on h3, rooks on g3 and h2, a knight on a3, and a bishop on f6
4. White's king looks quite exposed on h3

Looking at my legal moves, I notice my queen on e1 has many powerful options. Let me look for the most forcing move.

The move e1g3+ looks very promising as it would be a check, forcing White's king to move and potentially winning material since the rook on g3 would be attacked.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Looking at this position, I can see that Black is in a difficult endgame situation. White has a rook on h7 and a knight on a3, while Black has a king on d8, bishop on f8, and rook on h8, along with several pawns.

The White rook on h7 is very active and threatening. I need to find a way to improve my position or create counterplay.

Let me analyze the key candidate moves:
1. **h8g8** - Moves my rook to a more central file and away from potential tactics
2. **d8e8** or **d8c8** - King moves to potentially safer squares
3. Pawn moves like **g7g6** or **h7h6** - But these might weaken my king position

The rook move h8g8 looks most promising as it:
- Centralizes my rook
- Gets it off the h-file where it might be vulnerable
- Potentially prepares counterplay along the g-file or 8th rank

My king on d8 is in a precarious position, and I need to improve its safety. The white rook on h7 is quite active, and the white king on g4 is also well-placed.

Let me move my king to a safer square. Moving to e8 will get the king away from the center and potentially prepare to castle queenside if that becomes possible, or simply improve the king's safety.

- I have a rook on g8 and bishop on f8
- White has active pieces including a rook on e2 and king on g4
- This appears to be an endgame where I need to be very careful

Given the available moves, I should prioritize king safety. Moving the king to a safer square seems most prudent. The move Kd7 (e8d7) would centralize my king and potentially improve my defensive chances.

Looking at this endgame position, I can see:

- Black king on d7
- Black bishop on f8  
- Black rook on g8
- White king on g5
- White bishop on f6
- White knight on a3
- White rook on e2

This appears to be a complex endgame. The white king is quite active on g5, and there's a white bishop on f6 that's well-placed. I need to be careful about my king safety and look for the best defensive setup.

Let me analyze the key candidate moves:

1. **d7e8** - Moves the king toward the back rank, potentially preparing coordination with my rook
2. **g8h8** - Moves the rook to the corner, which might be passive
3. **d7c8** - King moves to the queenside
4. **g7g6+** - Pawn advance giving check to the white king

The move **g7g6+** looks very interesting as it gives check to the white king on g5, forcing it to move and potentially disrupting White's coordination.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Looking at the position, I can see this is an endgame with:
- Black: King on d7, Bishop on f8, Rook on g8, and several pawns
- White: King on g5, Bishop on f6, Rook on e2, Knight on c2, and some pawns

The white king is quite active on g5, and there's a white bishop on f6 that's well-placed. I need to be careful about my king safety and look for active moves.

Let me analyze the key candidate moves:
1. **Rg8-h8** - Moves the rook to the h-file, potentially preparing counterplay
2. **Rg8-g7** - Defends the 7th rank and keeps the rook active
3. **Kd7-e8** or **Kd7-d8** - King moves for safety
4. **Be8-g7** - Activates the bishop and potentially challenges White's bishop

Given the position, I think **Rg8-g7** is a strong move as it:
- Keeps my rook active on the 7th rank
- Defends my pawns
- Maintains flexibility for future moves
- Doesn't allow White's pieces to dominate completely

d7e8,d7c8,d7e6

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Looking at the position, I can see this is an endgame where I'm playing as Black with my king on d7. I have three legal moves available:
- d7e8 (king to e8)
- d7c8 (king to c8) 
- d7e6 (king to e6)

Let me analyze the position:
- White has a king on g5, a bishop on f6, a knight on c2, a rook on d2, and pawns on b5 and c5
- Black has a king on d7, a bishop on f8, a rook on g7, and pawns on a7, c7, e7, g6, and h7

This appears to be a complex endgame. The white king is actively placed on g5, and there's significant material still on the board. I need to consider king safety and activity.

Moving to e6 would centralize my king and keep it active, while e8 and c8 would move toward the back rank. Given that White has active pieces, I think centralizing with Ke6 is the most principled move.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Looking at this position, I can see:

- My king is on e6, somewhat centralized
- I have a rook on g7 that can potentially promote a pawn on g7 to g8
- White has their king on g5 and some pieces creating threats
- I have pawns on a7, c7, e7, g7, and h7

Wait, let me reconsider the board. Looking more carefully, I see I have a rook on g7 and my king on e6. The move g7g8 would move my rook to the back rank.

Given the position and that this appears to be an endgame, I should look for the most forcing and advantageous move. Moving the rook to the 8th rank (g7g8) would give me a rook on the back rank, which is typically very strong in endgames as it can control important squares and potentially create back-rank threats.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Looking at this position, I can see:

- My king is on e6 in a somewhat exposed position
- White has a rook on d2 and bishop on d4 that could be threatening
- White's king is on g5
- I have a rook on g8 and bishop on f8

Let me analyze the key candidate moves:

1. **e6f7** - Moves my king forward, potentially more active
2. **e6d7** - Moves my king back, more defensive
3. **f8g7** - Develops my bishop to a more active square
4. **f8h6** - Bishop move that could control important squares
5. **g8g7** - Rook move that could coordinate with other pieces

Given that my king is somewhat exposed and White's king is advanced on g5, I think the most prudent move is to improve my king's safety while maintaining piece coordination.

d7e8,d7c8,d7e6

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

I can see this is an endgame position where I have a king on d7, a bishop on f8, and a rook on g8, while White has a king on g5, a knight on b4, a bishop on b2, and a rook on d2.

Looking at my legal moves:
- d7e8: King moves to e8
- d7c8: King moves to c8  
- d7e6: King moves to e6

I need to analyze the position carefully. My king appears to be somewhat centralized on d7. Moving to e6 would bring my king more actively into the center and closer to White's king, which could be beneficial in this endgame. Moving to c8 or e8 would move my king toward the back rank, which seems more passive.

In endgames, active king play is usually crucial, so I'll advance my king toward the center.

2. White has a king on g5 and pieces including a rook on d2, bishop on b2, and knight on b4
3. I have a rook on g8, bishop on f8, and several pawns

The most pressing concern is king safety. My king on e6 is quite active but potentially vulnerable. Let me analyze the key candidate moves:

- **e6f7**: Moves my king to a more protected square
- **f8g7**: Develops my bishop to a strong diagonal
- **g8g7**: Activates my rook
- **f8h6**: Bishop move that could be interesting

Given the position, I think moving my king to safety is the priority. The move e6f7 gets my king to a more secure square while maintaining good central control.

- White also has a knight on b5 and a bishop on b2

The white king on g5 looks quite active and potentially dangerous. I should look for ways to improve my king safety or create counterplay.

Let me analyze the key candidate moves:
1. **Kg7** - Moves my king to a safer square and potentially prepares to support my pieces
2. **Rg7** - Defends along the 7th rank and keeps the rook active
3. **Bh6** - Attacks the white king and forces it to move
4. **Be8** - Retreats the bishop but keeps it safe

The move **Bh6+** looks very appealing as it gives check to the white king on g5, forcing it to move to a less active square and potentially disrupting White's coordination.

Let me analyze this position. I can see that:

1. I have a rook on g8, a king on f7, a bishop on h6, and several pawns
2. White has a rook on d6, a knight on b4, a king on g4, a bishop on b2, and some pawns
3. The white king on g4 looks quite exposed and advanced

Looking at the legal moves, I notice that my bishop on h6 has several good options. The move h6f4+ would give check to the white king on g4, forcing it to move and potentially improving my position.

Looking at this position, I can see that:

1. My king is on f6 (quite active in the center)
2. I have a rook on g8 that can move along the back rank
3. I have a bishop on f4 with good diagonal control
4. White has a rook on e6 and king on g4, with a knight on b4

This appears to be an endgame position. Let me look for the most forcing moves. I notice that my bishop on f4 has several good options, and my rook has mobility along the 8th rank.

The move that stands out to me is **f4e3** - this advances my bishop to a more active square, potentially creating threats and improving my piece coordination. The bishop on e3 would control important central squares and could support future tactical ideas.

2. My king is on f6 
3. I have pawns on a7, c7, g6, and h7
4. I have a bishop on e3
5. White has a rook on e6, a knight on b4, a bishop on b2, and king on g3

This appears to be an endgame position. Let me analyze the key features:

- White's rook on e6 is actively placed
- My bishop on e3 is well-centralized
- The white king on g3 looks somewhat exposed

I notice that my bishop on e3 has several good options. One particularly interesting move is **e3g5**, which would:
1. Attack the white rook on e6
2. Force the rook to move to a less active square
3. Maintain good central control with my bishop

This seems like the most forcing and beneficial move in the position.

Looking at this position, I can see that:

1. I'm playing as Black with a King on f6, Rook on g8, Bishop on g5, and pawns on a7, c7, e6, g6, and h7
2. White has a King on g3, Rook on e6, Knight on b4, Bishop on a1, and pawns on b6 and c5
3. This appears to be an endgame position

Let me analyze the key features:
- White's rook is actively placed on e6
- My rook on g8 has good mobility along the 8th rank
- My bishop on g5 is well-placed
- White's king is somewhat exposed on g3

I notice that my rook can move along the entire 8th rank. Let me look for the most forcing move. The move **g8g3** would be a rook check, forcing the White king to move and potentially gaining tempo.

Wait, I don't see g8g3 in the legal moves list, which means there must be something blocking that path or the white king isn't actually on g3. Let me reconsider the position.

Looking at the available moves, I think **g8a8** could be strong, improving my rook's position and potentially preparing back-rank tactics. Alternatively, **g5e3** with the bishop could be very strong, centralizing the bishop and putting pressure on White's position.

5. I have pawns that can advance

Looking at the position, I notice that White's king on g3 appears somewhat exposed. My bishop on e3 is well-placed and has several good squares available.

This appears to be an endgame position. Let me analyze the key features:

- White's king is actively placed on g4
- My rook has good mobility on the back rank
- The white rook on e6 is controlling the 6th rank where my king sits

I should look for active moves. The rook move to the back rank could be useful for creating threats or improving coordination. Let me consider Rg8-e8 to challenge the white rook and potentially create counterplay along the e-file.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

I can see this is an endgame position where I have a black king on f6, a black rook on e8, a black bishop on f2, and several pawns. White has a king on g4, a rook on e5, a bishop on f5, a knight on c6, and a pawn on b6.

Let me analyze the position more carefully. White's king is quite active on g4, and I need to be careful about potential threats. My rook on e8 has good mobility along the 8th rank, and my bishop on f2 is well-placed.

Looking at the tactical possibilities, I notice that White's king on g4 might be vulnerable. Let me consider a move that puts pressure on White's position.

make_move f2e3

This bishop move centralizes my bishop, controls important squares, and maintains pressure on White's position while keeping my pieces coordinated.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Looking at this endgame position, I can see:

- White King on g4
- White Rook on e6  
- White Bishop on f6
- White Knight on a7
- White pawns on b6, c5

- Black King on f7
- Black Rook on e8
- Black Bishop on e3
- Black pawns on c7, e7, g6, h7

This appears to be a complex endgame where both sides have active pieces. Let me analyze the key features:

1. The white king is quite active on g4
2. White has a rook and bishop creating pressure
3. My rook on e8 is on an open file
4. My bishop on e3 is well-placed

I notice that White's rook on e6 and bishop on f6 are creating some threats. I should look for active counterplay.

The move **e8e4+** looks very strong - it gives check to the white king on g4, forcing it to move and gaining tempo while activating my rook to a central square.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

I apologize for the error. Let me look more carefully at the position. It seems I misread the board layout. Let me check the legal moves again and make a proper move.

Looking at the available moves, I can see that e8e4 is not in the legal moves list, which means there must be something blocking that path or I misunderstood the position.

From the legal moves available, I notice several interesting options:

1. Rook moves along the 8th rank (e8h8, e8g8, e8f8, etc.)
2. King moves (f7g8, f7f8, f7e6)
3. Bishop moves from e3 (e3h6, e3g5, e3c5, etc.)
4. Pawn moves

Given that this appears to be an endgame position, I want to improve my piece activity. The move **e3g5** looks promising as it:
- Activates my bishop to a strong diagonal
- Potentially creates threats against White's position
- Keeps my pieces coordinated

Looking at this position, I can see:

- My king is on f7
- I have a rook on e8
- I have a bishop on g5
- White has their king on g4, a rook on e6, a bishop on f6, and a knight on b5

This appears to be an endgame position. Let me analyze the key threats and opportunities:

1. White's king is quite active on g4
2. My rook has good mobility on the 8th rank
3. My bishop on g5 is well-placed
4. I need to be careful about White's pieces coordinating

Given the position, I think moving my rook to create threats or improve its position would be good. The move Re8-e1 would put my rook on the first rank where it could be very active, but I don't see that in my legal moves list.

Looking at my options, I'll play Re8-a8 to move my rook to the a-file where it might create back-rank threats or support an advance.

2. White has a rook on e6 and bishop on f6, creating pressure
3. My king on f7 is somewhat restricted
4. I have a rook on a8 that could become more active

Key considerations:
- The move e7xf6 would capture White's bishop, which is a significant material gain
- My rook on a8 has many squares available along the 8th rank and a-file
- The pawn moves c7-c6 or c7xb6 could be relevant for pawn structure

The bishop on f6 is a strong piece that's limiting my king's mobility and supporting White's position. Capturing it seems like the most logical move.

5. White has a passed pawn on b6

Key considerations:
- My c7 pawn is under attack by the knight on b5
- I could capture the white rook with f7xe6, but I don't see that in my legal moves list, which suggests the rook might be protected or there's something I'm missing
- I should look for active rook moves or pawn breaks

The move c7xb6 looks interesting as it would capture White's advanced passed pawn and remove the knight's attack on c7. This would also open up the c-file for potential rook activity.

Looking at this position, I notice that White's rook on e6 is undefended and I can capture it with my king! This would be a significant material gain, winning the exchange (rook for nothing).

Let me analyze the consequences:
- If I play Kxe6, I win White's rook
- White's knight on d6 cannot immediately recapture
- This would give me a decisive material advantage in the endgame

This seems like a clear tactical opportunity that I should take.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

I can see this is an endgame position. Let me analyze what's on the board:

Black pieces (my pieces):
- King on e6
- Rook on a8
- Pawns on b6, f6, g6, h7

White pieces:
- King on f4
- Knight on d6
- Pawn on c5

This appears to be a complex endgame. Let me check what legal moves are available to me.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Now I can see my available moves. This is a rook and pawns vs knight and pawn endgame. Let me analyze the key features:

1. My rook on a8 has good mobility along the 8th rank and a-file
2. White's knight on d6 is well-centralized
3. White has a dangerous passed pawn on c5
4. My king on e6 is actively placed

The critical decision is whether to deal with White's passed c-pawn or try to create counterplay with my own pawns.

Looking at the position, I notice that if I can advance my kingside pawns, I might create winning chances. The move f6-f5 looks particularly attractive as it:
1. Advances my pawn majority on the kingside
2. Potentially creates threats against White's exposed king on f4
3. Opens up more space for my king

Proxy (to Player_Black):

You are a professional chess player and you play as black. Now is your turn to make a move. Before making a move you can pick one of the following actions:
- 'get_current_board' to get the schema and current status of the board
- 'get_legal_moves' to get a UCI formatted list of available moves
- 'make_move <UCI formatted move>' when you are ready to complete your turn (e.g., 'make_move e2e4')

Player_Black (to Proxy):

I'll start by examining the current board position to understand the game state.

Now I can see my available moves. This is a complex endgame position where I need to be careful. Let me analyze the key features:

1. White has a dangerous knight on e4 and a passed pawn on c5
2. My rook is somewhat passive on a8
3. I have a pawn majority on the kingside
4. The white king is actively placed on f4

Looking at my options, I notice I can capture the white pawn with `b6c5`, which would eliminate White's dangerous passed pawn. I can also capture the knight with `f5e4`, which would be winning material.

The knight capture looks very attractive since knights are generally worth about 3 points compared to a pawn's 1 point. Let me take the knight.
