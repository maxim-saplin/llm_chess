--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

I'll analyze the position and make a move as Black.

White has played 1.c3, which is a somewhat passive opening move. It controls the d4 square but doesn't immediately fight for the center.

As Black, I have several good options:
1. e5 - Taking central space
2. d5 - Taking central space
3. Nf6 - Developing a knight toward the center
4. c5 - Taking space on the queenside

I'll play 1...e5, which is a classical response that immediately stakes a claim in the center. This gives me good control of the central squares and opens lines for my bishop and queen.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Looking at the position and available moves, I need to develop my pieces and respond to White's early queen development.

The most principled approach is to continue development with a knight to f6, which controls the center, prepares for castling, and indirectly defends the e5 pawn.

After analyzing the position, I see several good options. I notice my king is still in the center, so castling kingside with h8g8 would be a good priority to improve my king's safety.

I also see that White has moved their queen to c2 early, which is unusual. My knights are well-developed on c6 and f6, and I have a pawn on e5 controlling the center.

Given these factors, I'll castle kingside to secure my king's position:

Now I can see all my legal moves. Let me analyze the position and make a strategic decision:

1. I should continue development, with priority on getting my pieces out and castling
2. The white queen on c2 is already developed, so I need to be careful about potential threats
3. My knights are already developed, so I should focus on bishops and preparing to castle

Looking at the available moves, developing my dark-squared bishop with Bf8-e7 looks very natural. This would:
- Develop a piece
- Protect my e5 pawn
- Prepare for castling

I can see all my legal moves now. Let me analyze the position:

1. I'm playing as Black and the position appears to be in the middle game
2. My king has castled kingside
3. White has developed pieces and has some central control
4. I have knights on c6 and f6, bishops on e7 and c8
5. There's a pawn on e5 that could be vulnerable

Looking at my options, I should focus on completing development and improving my position. My bishop on c8 is still undeveloped, and I could consider castling queenside or developing that bishop.

Among the strong candidate moves:
- a8b8 (preparing queenside development)
- d8e8 (connecting rooks)
- f6e4 (knight to an active central square)
- d7d5 (fighting for central control)

After consideration, I'll play d7d5, challenging White's center and opening lines for my pieces.

- 'get_legal_moves' to get a UCI formatted list of available moves
- 'make_move <UCI formatted move>' when you are ready to complete your turn (e.g., 'make_move e2e4')

After analyzing the position and my available legal moves, I'll make a decision.

I notice I have a developed position with knights on c6 and f6, bishops on c8 and e7, and pawns advanced to e5 and d5. White has a bishop pair and queen centralized.

One of my strongest moves would be to develop my bishop from c8 with tempo by playing c8f5, which develops a piece while threatening White's queen on c2.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

After analyzing the position and available moves, I can see I'm playing as Black in a complex middlegame position. I have several tactical opportunities to consider.

I notice my bishop on f5 is attacking White's queen on c2, but it's protected. I also have two knights that could potentially create threats. The e5 pawn is a point of tension in the center.

One strong move would be to develop my knight to e5, putting pressure on White's position and controlling important central squares:

Player_Black (to Proxy):

After analyzing the position and available moves, I see I have several good options. I notice I have two knights (on e5 and f6) and two bishops (on e7 and f5) already developed, which is good.

Looking at the position, I think strengthening my center with d5-d4 would be a strong move. This advances a central pawn, puts pressure on White's position, and gains space. It also supports my knight on e5 and could help in future operations on the queenside or center.

After analyzing the position and available moves, I see several interesting options:

1. My knight on e5 is well-positioned and could attack White's position with moves like e5g4 or e5f3
2. My bishop on f5 has good diagonals and could move to e6 or g6
3. My queen on d8 could develop to more active squares

The most pressing concern is that my king on f8 seems somewhat exposed with pieces around it. I should consider improving my position while maintaining king safety.

I'll move my knight from e5 to g4, creating threats and pressure on White's kingside:

- My king is on f8 with a rook on a8
- There appears to be some pressure on my kingside

One of my strongest moves appears to be moving my bishop from f5 to g6, which would protect my kingside and potentially force White's queen to retreat.

- I have knights on f6 and g4, with the g4 knight potentially having some active options
- My dark-squared bishop is on e7 and light-squared bishop on g6
- White has a queen on g5 that could be targeted

Looking at the legal moves, I see some tactical opportunities. The knight on g4 has several interesting options, including a potential fork with Ne3 that could attack White's king and rook.

I'll make this move:

Now I have a clear picture of the position and my available moves. Let me analyze the situation:

I notice that:
- White's queen is on h4, creating some pressure
- I have knights on f6 and e3, with the e3 knight being quite active
- My bishops are on e7 and g6
- The pawn structure is somewhat intact

Looking at my options, I see a few strong candidate moves:

1. Knight e3 captures on g4 (e3g4) - attacking White's position
2. Knight e3 captures on g2 (e3g2) - a fork potentially hitting White's rook and another piece
3. Knight e3 captures on c2 (e3c2) - attacking White's queenside
4. Knight f6 to e4 (f6e4) - developing to a strong central square

After evaluation, I believe the knight fork on g2 is particularly strong as it threatens multiple pieces.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

I need to analyze this position carefully. I see that:

1. White's queen is on h4, threatening my kingside
2. I have a knight on g2 that's deep in White's territory
3. My bishops are on e7 and g6
4. My queen is on d8

Looking at the legal moves, I notice several interesting options:
- I could move my knight on g2, but it's in a strong position and could be part of an attack
- I could develop my rook with a8c8 or a8b8
- I could move my queen to various squares
- I have a knight on f6 with several possible moves

Given the position, I think I should prioritize development and king safety. Moving my rook to c8 develops a piece and connects my rooks.

I'll analyze this position carefully before making my move.

I notice several key aspects of the position:
- White's queen is on h4, putting pressure on my kingside
- I have knights on f6 and g2, with the g2 knight being a strong outpost deep in White's territory
- My bishops are on e7 and g6
- White has a queen on h4 that could be threatening

Looking at my options, I see a few strong candidate moves:

1. Knight g2-e1+ would give check to White's king on d1
2. Knight f6-e4 would centralize my knight and attack White's d-pawn
3. Bishop e7-c5 would develop with pressure toward White's king position

After careful consideration, I'll play the knight check, which forces White to respond and gives me the initiative.

2. White's queen is on h4, potentially threatening my kingside
3. I have two bishops (e7 and g6) and two knights (f6 and e1)
4. My king is on f8 with a rook on each side

The knight on e1 is deep in White's territory and could be valuable. Let me consider the best move for it. Moving it to f3 would put pressure on White's g-pawn and potentially threaten the queen if it moves. The knight on f3 would be protected by my bishop on g6.

4. White has a queen on h4 that could be threatening

One strong move I see is to activate my knight on f3 by moving it to e5, which would control central squares and potentially threaten White's pieces.

Looking at the threats and opportunities, I notice my knight on e5 is well-positioned and can potentially fork White's pieces. The move e5c4 looks particularly strong as it attacks White's b-pawn while maintaining a strong central position.

I also see that my bishop on e7 can develop with a threat by moving to c5, putting pressure on White's position.

Given the current position, I'll play the knight move to e4, which develops my piece to a strong central square and puts pressure on White's position.

I notice I have two knights on c4 and e4 that are well-positioned. My dark-squared bishop on e7 is also active. I should look for a move that improves my position while addressing any immediate threats.

One strong move would be to activate my knight on e4 by moving it to c5, which attacks White's pawn on d3 and improves my knight's position.

After analyzing the position and available moves, I notice several key factors:

1. White's queen is on e5, creating pressure
2. I have two knights (c4 and c5) that could potentially make strong moves
3. My dark-squared bishop on e7 could develop further
4. My king's position seems relatively safe at the moment

One particularly strong move I see is to develop my knight from c5 to e4, which:
- Attacks White's queen
- Establishes a strong central outpost
- Creates potential threats against White's position

After analyzing the position and legal moves, I can see I'm playing as Black and have several interesting options.

I notice my king is on f8, and I have a knight on f2 that's quite active in White's position. I also have a bishop on g6 that could be developed further. My pawn structure seems intact except for the d-pawn which appears to be advanced to d4.

Looking at the tactical possibilities, I see my knight on f2 has several strong moves. Moving it to e4 looks particularly powerful as it would attack White's queen on f6 while also establishing a strong central presence.

- My knight on f2 is attacking White's pieces and could make a strong move

One of the most promising moves is the knight on f2, which can deliver a fork or gain material. Let me play:

4. I have two bishops (e7 and g6)

The most pressing issue is the white queen on f6 which is creating threats. I should prioritize safety and development.

One strong move is to develop my knight on d3 to f4, which attacks the white queen and forces it to move. This would relieve some pressure.

After analyzing the position and my available legal moves, I notice several key factors:

1. My king is on f8 with a rook on each side
2. White's queen is on f6, putting pressure on my position
3. I have two bishops (e7 and g6) and two knights (c4 and f4)
4. There appears to be tactical opportunities with my knights

One of my strongest moves appears to be f4e6, which would place my knight on e6. This is a strong central square that attacks White's queen on f6, forcing it to move. This would relieve some pressure on my position while developing my piece to an excellent square.

I notice I have several tactical opportunities. My knights on c4 and c5 are active, and I have bishops on e7 and g6. Looking at the position, I see White has a queen on f3 and the white king appears to be on c2.

One strong move would be to play Nc4e3, which attacks White's queen on f3 while also threatening a potential fork of the king and another piece. This creates immediate pressure.

I think one of my strongest moves is to develop my rook to e8, centralizing it and potentially preparing for action in the center or kingside.

Looking at the threats and opportunities:
- White has bishops on c3 and d3, with the queen on f3 potentially creating pressure
- I should consider my king's safety and potential development of my pieces

Among my options, I think castling kingside would be a good move to improve my king's safety:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

After analyzing the position and my legal moves, I need to make a decision. I notice several important factors:

1. My king on e8 is in the center, and White's queen is on e5, creating some pressure
2. I have a bishop on e7 that's under attack by White's queen
3. I have a knight on f5 that could make several moves

One of my strongest options is to move my knight from f5 to d6, which would:
- Attack White's queen on e5
- Protect my e7 bishop
- Develop my knight to a strong central square

I need to analyze this position carefully. I'm playing as Black and there are several tactical considerations:

1. My king is on e8 with rooks on c8 and g8
2. White has two bishops on c3 and c4, and the queen on e4 is attacking my d4 pawn
3. I have knights on d6 and bishops on e7 and g6

Looking at the legal moves, I notice several key options:
- I could castle kingside with g8h8
- I could move my queen from d8
- I need to be careful about the white queen on e4 attacking my d4 pawn

The most pressing issue is the attack on my d4 pawn. I should either defend it or make a more valuable counterattack. Moving my bishop from g6 to e4 would attack the white queen while defending my pawn.

Let me analyze the position and make a good move as Black.

I notice several key aspects of the position:
- I have a bishop on g2 that's actively attacking the white king's position
- My pawn on d4 is advanced and could potentially promote
- White has two bishops, one on c4 and one on d4

Looking at my legal moves, I see some strong options:
1. The bishop on g2 has several good moves, particularly g2e4 which would attack the white rook on a8
2. Advancing the d4 pawn with d4d3 increases pressure in the center
3. I could improve my king's safety with castling (f8g8 or h8g8)

After careful consideration, I'll move my bishop to e4, which attacks the white rook on a8 and improves my piece activity.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

I need to analyze the position carefully before making my move.

Looking at the board, I notice:
- I'm playing as Black and have two bishops on e4 and e7
- White has two bishops on d5 and f7
- My king is on f8 with a rook on h8
- I have a pawn on d4 that could be advanced

Among my options:
- The bishop on e4 has many possible moves and is quite active
- I could consider developing my rook on c8
- My queen on d8 has several options

After evaluating the position, I'll move my bishop on e4 to capture White's pawn on h1, which gives me material advantage without immediate drawbacks.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

After analyzing the position, I see several interesting options:

1. I have a bishop on h1 that's attacking diagonally and could be developed to various squares
2. My king is on f8 with potential to castle kingside (h8g8)
3. I have a queen on d8 with several possible moves
4. I have a bishop on e7 that could move to d6

The most striking feature is my bishop on h1, which is quite active on the long diagonal. I should consider either maintaining this bishop or using it to capture something valuable.

Looking at the position, I notice I have a bishop on h1 that's attacking the white king on d1. This is a check and a very powerful move.

I need to analyze this position carefully. 

I notice several key aspects:
- I'm playing as Black and have two bishops (e7 and g2)
- White has two bishops (d7 and f7) and two knights (c3 and f1)
- My king is on f8 with a rook on h8
- I have a pawn on d4 that could be vulnerable

Looking at my options, the bishop on g2 is particularly active and has several strong moves. It's attacking the white king on d2 and has multiple good squares available.

The most powerful move appears to be g2e4, moving my bishop to e4 where it attacks both the white king on d2 and the undefended rook on a1, creating a double attack (fork). This would win material as White cannot defend both pieces simultaneously.

One of the strongest moves appears to be moving my bishop from e4 to g2, which attacks White's king on d2 and puts White in check. This forces White to respond to the check and gives me the initiative.

After analyzing the position and available moves, I notice several important factors:

1. I have two bishops - one on d6 and another on g2
2. My king is on f8 with a rook on h8
3. White has a bishop on f6 that's restricting some of my movement

Looking at my options, I see a particularly strong move with my bishop on g2. This bishop is attacking White's knight on h1, and I can also use it to create threats elsewhere.

I'll play:

make_move g2f1

This move attacks White's rook on h1 while also potentially setting up future threats along the a6-f1 diagonal. It maintains control of important squares and improves my bishop's position.

Looking at the board, I notice:

- White has a bishop on e8
- My king is on f8
- I have a pawn on d4 that could be vulnerable
- White has knights on e5 and h2, and the king on d2

One of my strongest pieces is the bishop on f1, which is attacking along the a6-f1 diagonal. I also see my bishop on d6 has several good diagonal options.

The move f1e2 looks particularly strong as it attacks White's king on d2. This would be a check and force White to respond to the threat.

- White has a knight on d4 that's attacking my bishop on e2
- White has a bishop on d8 that's in an unusual position (likely just captured)
- My king is on f8 and appears safe for now

One of my strongest pieces is the bishop on e2, which is under attack by the knight on d4. I should either move this bishop or capture the knight with another piece.

Looking at the legal moves, I notice the bishop on e2 has several options. Moving it to f3 looks particularly strong as it would attack White's king on d1 while maintaining control of important squares.

One of the strongest moves I see is to attack White's king with my bishop:

This move puts my bishop on e2, directly attacking White's king on d2. This creates a powerful check that White must respond to immediately. It also maintains control of important diagonals and puts pressure on White's position.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Let me analyze the position and make a strong move.

I notice several key aspects of the position:
- I have two bishops (on d6 and e2) that are well-positioned
- My king on f8 seems relatively safe
- I have a passed pawn on d3 that could be valuable
- White has a rook on c4 that's quite active

Looking at my options, I see a few strong candidates:
1. Developing my rook with c8b8 or c8a8
2. Moving my bishop e2 to control more squares
3. Advancing my d3 pawn

The bishop on e2 is particularly powerful, controlling the long diagonal. I think strengthening its position by moving it to g4 would be a good strategic choice, putting pressure on White's position.

I notice I have two bishops - one on d6 and one on e2, with the latter being particularly active. My king is on f8, and I have a pawn on d3 that's advanced.

Looking at White's position, I see their king is on d2, somewhat exposed, and they have a rook on e4 that could be targeted.

One of my strongest moves is to use my bishop on e2 to attack White's knight on g4, which would gain material:

Player_Black (to Proxy):

I see the current position and my legal moves. Let me analyze the situation:

1. I'm playing as Black and have two legal moves: f8f7 (King from f8 to f7) or d8e8 (Queen from d8 to e8)
2. I notice my king on f8 is in check from the white rook on e6
3. I need to address this check immediately

Looking at my options:
- f8f7: Moving my king away from the check
- d8e8: Interposing my queen between the king and the attacking rook

The king move to f7 appears safer as it gets out of the check directly. Moving the queen to e8 would block the check but could potentially expose my queen to capture.

I'll make my decision:

3. There appears to be a potential checkmate threat I need to address

The most urgent priority is to deal with the check from the rook on e5. I have a few options:

1. Move my king out of check
2. Capture the rook
3. Block the check

1. Material is roughly equal (I have two bishops, a queen, two rooks, and several pawns)
2. White has a rook on e8 that's attacking my position
3. My king is on g7
4. I have a bishop on g4 that could be under threat

Let me check what legal moves I have available.

1. White's rook on e8 is a major threat that needs to be addressed
2. My queen on d8 is under attack by this rook
3. I have the opportunity to capture the rook with either my queen or rook

Taking the rook with my queen (d8e8) would be a mistake since White's other rook could recapture. However, I can capture with my rook from h8, which would be a clean capture of a rook.

I'll capture White's rook on e8:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

After analyzing the position and my available moves, I notice I have a strong position as Black. I have two bishops aimed at the kingside, my queen is active, and White's king appears to be somewhat exposed on d3.

One of the strongest moves I see is to bring my queen into the attack with:

make_move d8h4

This move puts pressure on White's position by:
1. Creating a powerful queen-bishop battery with my dark-squared bishop on e6
2. Threatening the h-pawn
3. Potentially setting up tactical threats against White's king
4. Maintaining control of the center

This aggressive move aligns with my advantage in piece activity and development.

Looking at my options, I see a strong move with my bishop from e6 to g4, which would attack White's king. This creates a direct threat and forces White to respond.

I notice I have a bishop on d6 with several good diagonal moves available. Looking at the position, I see my king is on g6, and White's king is on d3. White has a knight on f1 and a bishop on g2.

One of my strongest moves would be to use my bishop on d6 to attack White's position. The move Bd6-h2 looks particularly strong as it attacks deep into White's territory and could potentially set up threats.

The bishop on g4 can capture a piece on d7 (based on the legal moves list showing g4d7), which is likely a strong tactical opportunity.

After analyzing the position and available moves, I see several interesting options. I notice I have two rooks on the 8th rank, two bishops, and my king is on g7. White has a bishop on b4, a knight on f1, and the king on d3.

One of the strongest moves I can make is to attack White's king with my bishop:

make_move g3f2

This move puts my bishop on f2, creating a powerful attack on White's king at d3. This is a direct threat that White must respond to, and it controls important squares around White's king. If White isn't careful, this could lead to checkmate opportunities.

After analyzing the position and my legal moves, I can see I'm playing as Black and have several strong options.

The position shows I have two rooks on the 8th rank, two bishops (one on d7 and one on f2), and my king on g6. White has a bishop on c3, a knight on f1, and the king on d3. Material appears to be roughly even.

Looking at my options, I notice I can use my bishop on f2 to deliver a powerful check:

make_move f2e3

This move checks the White king and attacks the square the king would likely retreat to (e2). This creates a strong tactical threat and puts immediate pressure on my opponent.

2. My king is on g6, somewhat exposed
3. White has a king on d3, a knight on f1, and a bishop on h1
4. I have a bishop on e3 that's attacking diagonally and could be powerful

Looking at my options, I see a strong move with my bishop on e3. I can capture White's knight on f1 with:

make_move e3f2

This move:
1. Captures White's knight on f1 (which appears to be on f1 based on the legal moves)
2. Puts pressure on White's position
3. Maintains my material advantage

I can see my legal moves now. Let me analyze the position:

I'm playing as Black and have several key pieces: two rooks on c8 and e8, two bishops on d7 and g6, and my king on g7. White has a bishop on e5, a knight on f2, and the king on d4.

Looking at my options:
- I have several moves with my bishop on g6
- I can move my rook on e8 to e4, which would attack White's bishop on e5
- I can move my bishop on d7 to f5, which would put pressure on White's position

The most powerful move appears to be e8e4, attacking White's bishop on e5 with my rook. This creates an immediate threat and puts pressure on White's position. The bishop can't be easily defended, and this move would give me a material advantage if White can't respond effectively.

After analyzing the position, I see several strong options:

1. I have a rook on c8 and c4, both with many available moves
2. I have bishops on d7 and g3, with the g3 bishop targeting White's king area
3. My king is on g7, and I have pawns on a7, b7, and h7

The most powerful move I see is to use my rook on c4 to attack along the c-file, potentially creating threats against White's position.

After analyzing the position, I see I have several strong options. I'm playing as Black and have two rooks, two bishops, and my king against White's king and two knights. I'm clearly ahead in material.

Looking at the position, I notice my rook on c2 is attacking along the c-file with no immediate threats to it. I also have a rook on h8 that could be developed better. My bishop on g6 is well placed, controlling important diagonals.

One of the strongest moves would be to bring my rook from h8 to the center with:

make_move h8e8

This centralizes my rook, controls the e-file, and increases my piece coordination. From e8, the rook supports potential attacks against White's position and helps control the center of the board, which is crucial for converting my material advantage.

2. White has two knights and a pawn on a4
3. My rook on e8 is currently under attack by White's knight on c3

Since my rook on e8 is under attack, I need to address this immediately. I have several options:

1. Move the rook along the e-file or 8th rank
2. Capture the attacking knight (not possible here)
3. Defend the rook (not practical in this position)

Looking at my options, I'll move the rook to h8, which keeps it safe while maintaining control of the back rank.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

After analyzing the position, I see I have several good options. I'm playing as Black and need to make a strong move.

I notice I have two bishops, a rook on h8, another rook on b2, and my king on g6. White has a knight on c3 and f1, with the white king on a1. I also see I have a pawn on a4, which could be dangerous.

Looking at my options, I see a particularly strong move with my rook on b2. I can attack the white king directly with:

- I can improve my bishop on g6
- I can advance my rook on h8

The most decisive move appears to be attacking White's king directly with my rook on a2. Since White's king is on b1, I can deliver check.

- A rook on h8
- Several pawns (a7, b7, g7, h7)

White has:
- A king on b2
- Two knights (on c8 and f1)
- A pawn on a4

Let me check what legal moves I have available.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

After analyzing the position and the legal moves, I can see several promising options:

1. The bishop on g3 is very active and can potentially deliver a check by moving to e1.
2. The rook on h8 can move along the back rank to attack the white knight on c8.
3. The bishop on d7 has several diagonal moves available.

The most decisive move appears to be:

make_move g3e1

This bishop move delivers check to the white king on b2 from e1. Since there's no piece that can block this check and the king can't capture the bishop, this should be a strong move that forces the white king to move and gives me the initiative.

I notice several strong options:
1. I can move my bishop on d7 to create threats
2. I can improve my king position
3. I can reposition my rook on the back rank

The bishop on d7 has particularly good diagonals. Moving it to f5 creates a powerful diagonal and puts pressure on White's position.

- I have two bishops (on f5 and e1), a rook on h8, and my king on g6
- White has two knights (on c3 and f1) and the king on b2
- Material is roughly equal, but I need to improve my position

The most promising moves appear to be:

1. Bishop moves with the f5 bishop, particularly f5e4 which controls more central squares
2. Rook moves along the back rank, especially h8c8 which attacks the knight
3. Bishop moves with the e1 bishop to develop it better

After consideration, I'll move my rook to attack White's knight.

2. I have two powerful bishops controlling diagonals
3. White has a king on b2, a knight on f1, and a bishop on c3

Let me consider my best options:
- The bishop on f5 can capture the white bishop on c8 with f5c8
- The bishop on e1 has several good moves including e1f2 which attacks the white knight
- Moving my king to a safer square could be prudent

The most immediate opportunity is capturing the white bishop with my bishop. This gives me a material advantage without any apparent risk.

I'll move my bishop from e1 to h4, which maintains pressure and improves my piece positioning.

I see the current position. As Black, I have two bishops and a king, with a few pawns, while White has a king and a knight. Let me check what legal moves I have available.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

After analyzing the position and my legal moves, I see several good options:

1. I could move my bishop from c8 to develop it further
2. I could improve my king position
3. I could advance my pawns
4. I could reposition my bishop on h4

The bishop on h4 is particularly active and is currently attacking White's knight on d8 diagonally. I can strengthen this attack by moving the bishop to e7, maintaining pressure on the knight while developing a more centralized position.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Thank you for providing the legal moves. Now I can analyze the position and make a decision.

Looking at the position, I notice:
- I have two bishops and three pawns against White's lone knight
- My king is on g6, and I should consider its safety
- I should look for opportunities to improve my piece positioning

Among the available moves, I'll consider:
1. Improving my bishop positions (particularly the c8 bishop which is undeveloped)
2. Advancing pawns to create passed pawns
3. Moving my king to a safer or more active position

The c8 bishop is currently undeveloped, so activating it with c8e6 or c8f5 would be good. The move c8f5 looks particularly strong as it controls important central squares.

Thank you for providing the legal moves. Now I can analyze the position and make a decision.

Looking at the position, I notice I have two bishops against White's lone knight, giving me a material advantage. My king is relatively safe on g7, but I should consider improving my position further.

Among my options:
- I could advance my a-pawn with a7a6 or a7a5
- I could move my h-pawn with h7h6 or h7h5
- I could reposition my bishops to more active squares

The bishop on f5 has several good options. Moving it to c2 (f5c2) would attack White's king directly, forcing a response. This seems like a strong move that puts immediate pressure on my opponent.

I'll make this move:

Thank you for providing the legal moves. Let me analyze the position and make the best move.

I have several strategic options:
1. Improve my bishop positions
2. Advance my pawns
3. Improve my king position

Looking at the position, I notice my bishop on c2 is very active and pins the white king to that diagonal. My bishop on e8 could be more active. I also have pawn advancement opportunities.

The most principled approach would be to activate my e8 bishop while maintaining control. Moving it to g5 (e7g5) would place it on a good diagonal, controlling important squares and adding pressure.

Let me analyze this position:

I'm playing as Black and have:
- King on g6
- Two bishops (on g5 and c2)
- Three pawns (on a7, h7, and g7)

White has:
- King on c3
- Knight on c4

Looking at the legal moves, I need to consider my best option. The bishop on c2 is attacking the white king on c3, putting it in check. However, I need to be careful as the white knight on c4 is protecting the king.

My bishop on g5 has many diagonal moves available. I could consider improving its position or using it to control key squares.

Given that I have a material advantage (two bishops and three pawns vs. a king and knight), I should focus on maintaining my advantage while advancing toward checkmate.

One strong move would be to move my bishop from c2 to e4, which maintains the check on the white king while also controlling important central squares.

- I could improve my king's position with g6f6 or g6f7
- I could advance a pawn with a7a5 to create more space

Now I can see all my legal moves. Let me analyze the position and make a strategic decision:

1. I have two bishops against White's lone knight, giving me a material advantage.
2. My king is relatively safe on g6.
3. My bishop on g4 is attacking empty squares, but the bishop on f3 is well-positioned.

Looking at my options, I notice I can improve my position in several ways:

- I could advance my a-pawn with a7a5 to challenge White's knight
- I could move my bishop on g4 to a more active diagonal
- I could improve my king position

The bishop on g4 seems to be on a good diagonal but could be more active. Moving it to e6 (g4e6) would control important central squares, but I don't see that move in my legal moves list.

I think the strongest move is to move my bishop from f3 to e4, which puts pressure on White's position and controls important central squares.

I can see the current position. Black has a king on g6, two bishops on e4 and g4, and pawns on a7, g7, and h7. White has a king on c3 and a knight on b1.

Let me check what legal moves I have available.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Now I can see all my legal moves. Let me analyze the position and make the best move:

I have two bishops and three pawns against White's lone knight. This is a winning material advantage. 

Looking at the position:
- My king is on g6
- I have bishops on e4 and g4
- White's king is on c3 and knight on b1

Key considerations:
1. I should look for any immediate tactical opportunities
2. I could improve my bishop positions to control more squares
3. I could advance my pawns toward promotion

The bishop on e4 is already well-placed, controlling the a8-h1 diagonal. I notice my bishop on g4 can capture the knight on b1, which would further increase my material advantage.

I apologize for the error. Let me check the board again. I misread the position - the bishop is on g5, not g4. Let me try again with the correct move.

I apologize for the confusion. Let me carefully review the legal moves again. It seems I misunderstood the position.

Looking at the legal moves provided: g6f7,g6h6,g6f6,g6h5,g6f5,g5d8,g5e7,g5h6,g5f6,g5h4,g5f4,g5e3,g5d2,g5c1,e4a8,e4b7,e4c6,e4f5,e4d5,e4f3,e4d3,e4g2,e4c2,e4h1,e4b1,h7h6,a7a6,h7h5,a7a5

I see that e4b1 is a legal move, which would capture the knight on b1 with my bishop on e4.

Looking at the position and my legal moves, I need to make a strategic decision.

I notice that:
- I'm playing as Black with a material advantage (two bishops and three pawns vs White's lone king)
- White's king is on b4
- My king is on g6
- I have bishops on g5 and b1
- Pawns on a7, h7, and g7

One of my strongest moves would be to use my bishop on b1 to control more of the board while putting pressure on White's king. The move b1e4 places the bishop on a strong central square, controls important squares around White's king, and maintains a safe distance.

I have a significant material advantage with two bishops and three pawns versus just a lone king. This is a completely winning position for Black. My goal should be to coordinate my pieces to force checkmate.

Looking at the position, I notice that my bishop on e4 controls important squares and can help restrict White's king. Moving this bishop to f3 would maintain control while allowing me to potentially advance my pawns safely.

I have a winning position with material advantage and can aim for checkmate. The most direct approach is to coordinate my pieces to restrict White's king and deliver checkmate.

I'll move my bishop from f3 to e4, which controls important squares and helps restrict the White king's movement. This maintains my control of the position while preparing for a checkmate sequence.

You are a professional chess player and you play as black. Now is your turn to make a move. Before making a move you can pick one of the following actions:
- 'get_current_board' to get the schema and current status of the board
- 'get_legal_moves' to get a UCI formatted list of available moves
- 'make_move <UCI formatted move>' when you are ready to complete your turn (e.g., 'make_move e2e4')

I can see that White has played an early knight to f3 and pushed the e-pawn to e5. As Black, I've developed my knight to f6. Let me check what legal moves I have available.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

After analyzing the position, I see several good options:

1. I could challenge White's e5 pawn with Nxe4, but that might be premature
2. I could develop my knight with Nc6, which is a solid developing move
3. I could play d6 to challenge White's center pawn
4. I could develop my bishop with Be7

Since White has advanced the e-pawn to e5, I'll play d6 to challenge it immediately. This is a standard response in many openings when White pushes the e-pawn too far forward too early.

After analyzing the position, I see we're in an early opening position where White has played Nf3, attacking our e5 pawn. I need to defend this pawn and continue development.

The most principled move here is to develop my knight to c6, which defends the e5 pawn and develops a piece. This is a standard move in many openings like the Two Knights Defense or other open games.

2. I could protect my f6 knight by moving my g7 pawn to g6
3. I could develop my pieces with moves like Be7 or Bd7

The most direct response is to capture White's knight since it's undefended.

After analyzing the position and my legal moves, I'll make a move that addresses White's knight on h5 while developing my pieces.

The knight on h5 is somewhat exposed and can be challenged. I'll play g7-g6, which helps control the f5 and h5 squares, prepares to fianchetto my bishop to g7 (a strong development), and indirectly challenges White's knight.

1. e8d8 - Capturing the white rook with my king
2. e8e7 - Moving my king to e7
3. c6d8 - Capturing the white rook with my knight

Let me evaluate these options:
- e8d8: Capturing the rook with my king is good material-wise, but puts my king in the center which could be dangerous
- e8e7: Moving my king to e7 avoids capture but abandons material
- c6d8: Capturing the rook with my knight is best as I regain material while keeping my king safer

I'll capture the rook with my knight.

Thank you for providing the legal moves. After analyzing the position, I can see several good options.

I notice my knight on h4 can make some interesting moves, and I also have the opportunity to complete my kingside development. Since White has a knight on h5 that could potentially cause trouble, I should consider how to best respond.

One of the strongest moves here would be to complete my castling by moving the rook to g8, which would solidify my king's position and connect my rooks.

After analyzing the position, I can see I'm playing as Black with a fairly standard development. I notice:

1. My king is on e8 with pieces developed
2. White has a knight on h5 that could be threatening
3. I have several good developing moves available

I'll choose to develop my dark-squared bishop to e6, which improves my position by:
- Developing a piece
- Controlling important central squares
- Preparing for potential kingside castling

Looking at the legal moves, I should prioritize king safety and piece coordination. I notice my king is still in the center, which can be dangerous. Castling would be ideal, but I see I can only castle kingside with g8h8 and e8f8 (O-O).

I'll castle kingside to improve my king's safety:

I'm playing as Black and have a fairly developed position with both knights out, both bishops, and castled kingside. I notice my bishop on e7 is well-positioned and could potentially move to g5 or h4 to pin White's knight or attack the queenside.

My knight on h5 is active and could potentially move to f4 to attack White's center or g3 to fork pieces.

Looking at the pawn structure, I should consider strengthening my center with moves like d6-d5.

After evaluating the options, I'll play the knight from h5 to f4, which puts pressure on White's center and could potentially threaten a fork later.

I notice I have a knight on f4 that's quite active and can make several interesting moves. I also have two bishops - one on e7 and one on e6 that could be developed further.

Looking at the position, I see my knight on f4 can attack White's bishop on h3 or potentially move to d5 as a central outpost. My bishop on e6 could also move to f5 to increase its activity.

I'll choose to move my knight from f4 to d5, occupying a strong central square and putting pressure on White's position:

Looking at the available moves, I should focus on improving my position. The knight on d5 is well-placed in the center and has several good options. Moving it to f4 would put pressure on White's position and potentially threaten the g2 pawn (though it's not on the board currently).

Another strong option is developing my bishop on e6 to f5, which would control more of the center and potentially target White's queenside.

After consideration, I'll move my bishop from e6 to f5, which improves my control of the center and develops my pieces harmoniously.

After analyzing the position and my available moves, I see several good options. I notice I have two knights (on d8 and f4) and two bishops (on e7 and f5) that could be developed.

The knight on f4 is particularly active and could make some interesting moves. I also see my king is on f8 with a rook on each side.

I'll play a strong developing move with my knight on f4, bringing it to d5 where it controls several important central squares and puts pressure on White's position.

After analyzing the position, I can see I'm playing as Black with a fairly developed position. I notice my king is on f8, and I have several active pieces including knights on d5 and d8, bishops on e7 and f5, and rooks on c8 and f8.

Looking at the legal moves, I should prioritize king safety and piece coordination. The knight on d5 is particularly well-placed and could be used for an attack or to improve my position.

I think one of the strongest moves here is to develop my bishop on e7 to g5, which puts pressure on White's position and improves my piece activity.

One strong move would be to develop my bishop on g5 to e7, which would protect my king and connect my rooks. This is a natural developing move that improves my position.

I'll analyze this position carefully to make the best move as Black.

Looking at the board, I notice:
- I have two knights (on d8 and d5)
- Two bishops (on e7 and f5)
- My king is on f8 with rooks on c8 and g8
- The pawn structure is relatively intact

Among my options, I see some tactical opportunities. The knight on d5 has several good outposts, and my bishop on f5 is actively placed. 

I think one of the strongest moves here is to improve my knight position with:

make_move d5f4

This knight move to f4 creates pressure in White's position, attacks the g2 area, and positions my knight on a strong central outpost where it can't be easily challenged by pawns. This square gives the knight excellent mobility and attacking potential.

3. I have a bishop on f5 that's active and attacking White's position
4. I have a knight on f4 that's well-positioned in White's territory

Looking at my options, I should prioritize king safety and development. The move Kf8 (e8f8) would improve my king's position by moving it away from the center file and preparing to castle by hand later.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

After analyzing the position, I see several strong options for Black. 

I notice I have two bishops (on e7 and f4) and two knights (on d8 and e4) that are active. My king is on f8 with a rook on g8. White has a queen on f5 which could be dangerous.

One of the strongest moves appears to be moving my knight from e4 to f5, which would:
1. Attack White's queen on f5
2. Create a strong knight outpost
3. Potentially force White to retreat the queen

Let me make this move:

Player_Black (to Proxy):

After analyzing the position and the available legal moves, I'll make my decision.

I notice I have several strong pieces in active positions, including two bishops, two knights, and a rook. Looking at the position, I see that my bishop on f5 has several good options, and developing my knight on d8 could also be valuable.

One particularly strong move I see is to develop my bishop on f5 to e6, which would protect my d-pawn while maintaining control of important central squares. This bishop is currently undefended on f5, so repositioning it to a safer but still active square makes sense.

The knight on f4 is particularly active and can attack White's pieces. Moving it to d3 would create a fork threatening both White's rook on a3 and potentially the bishop on d4.

I'm playing as Black and have several interesting options. I notice I have two bishops (on e6 and e7), a knight on d8, and another knight on f4 that seems to be active. My king is on f8 with a rook on g8.

Looking at my options, I see some tactical opportunities:
- My knight on f4 has several good squares including g2 which could potentially fork pieces
- My bishop on e6 has good diagonal control
- My bishop on e7 can move to g5 or h4 which could increase pressure

After evaluating the position, I think the knight move f4-g2 looks particularly strong as it attacks White's king on g1 and potentially creates a fork. This is a tactical opportunity I should capitalize on.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

After analyzing the position, I can see I'm playing as Black with a fairly complex middlegame position. I have several pieces developed, including two bishops, two knights, and a rook.

Looking at the legal moves, I notice a few key opportunities:

1. My bishop on e7 has several diagonal moves available
2. My bishop on e6 can move in multiple directions
3. I have a knight on d5 in a strong central position with many options
4. I have a knight on d8 that could be better developed

The knight on d5 looks particularly strong, and I should consider if there are any tactical opportunities with it. Looking at the position, moving this knight to f4 seems promising as it attacks White's position and puts pressure on their kingside.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

After analyzing the position and my available legal moves, I need to make a strategic decision.

I notice I have two bishops (on e7 and g4), two knights (on d8 and f4), and a rook on f8. My king is on f6. White has a queen on e1, two bishops (on b2 and d2), two knights (on b1 and h4), and two rooks (on b3 and f3).

Looking at the position, I see that my bishop on g4 is attacking White's rook on f3, which is defending the g3 square where White's king is located. This creates tactical opportunities.

I'll play the bishop move g4f3, capturing White's rook which defends the king. This will significantly weaken White's position and give me a material advantage.

After analyzing the position, I see I have several good options. I notice I have two bishops (on e7 and f4) and two knights (on d8 and e4) that can make moves, along with various pawn moves.

The knight on e4 is particularly active and has many options. I also see that my king is on f8 with a rook on g8, and I could consider king safety.

One strong move would be to develop my knight on e4 to f6, which would protect my king and control important central squares:

Looking at the position more carefully, I notice my bishop on f5 has a powerful diagonal and can attack White's position. One particularly strong move is to capture White's pawn on c2, which would threaten White's knight on b1.

- White has a queen on f1, which could be dangerous
- My king on f6 seems relatively safe at the moment

Among my options, I see several strong candidates:
- Knight e4 has many good options, including e4f3 which attacks White's king
- Bishop f4 has several diagonal moves available
- Knight d8 can develop to better squares

After evaluating the position, I believe the best move is to attack White's king with my knight.

2. My dark-squared bishop on e7 can develop further
3. My king on f8 is relatively safe but could improve its position
4. White has a rook on c3 that's quite active

Looking at my strongest options:
- Knight f3 to e4 looks promising, attacking the center
- Knight f4 to d5 would create a strong central outpost
- Bishop e7 to g5 would increase my piece activity

I'll go with the knight move to e4, which controls important central squares and puts pressure on White's position.

The knight on e4 is particularly well-placed and could make some strong moves. I also see that my bishop on e7 could move to g5 to pin White's queen against their king.

I'll play the bishop move e7g5, pinning the queen to the king. This creates an immediate tactical threat and puts pressure on White's position.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

I need to analyze this position carefully. As Black, I have several pieces under attack and need to make a strong move.

Looking at the board:
- My king is on f8 with a rook on g8
- White has a rook on c7 threatening my knight on d8
- I have bishops on e4 and g5, knights on d8 and f4
- Material seems roughly equal

Key observations:
- My knight on d8 is under attack by the white rook on c7
- I should either move the knight or capture something valuable

Among my options, I see that my bishop on e4 can capture on h1, which appears to be a free piece. This would be a material gain.

3. My king on f8 is somewhat exposed with White's rook on c7

Looking at my options, I notice my bishop on g5 has several strong moves. It can attack White's queen from f4 or potentially pin pieces. My knight on e6 also has tactical possibilities.

After evaluating the position, I believe the best move is to attack White's queen with my bishop:

I need to analyze this position carefully. I see that:

1. I have two bishops (a8 and e5), two knights (d8 and e6), and a rook (f8)
2. White has a queen on c3, a rook on c7, and knights on h4 and d4
3. My king is on f8 and appears to be somewhat exposed

Let me consider my best options:

- The bishop on e5 has several good moves, including taking the knight on h2 (e5h2)
- My knight on e6 has mobility and could potentially fork pieces
- The bishop on a8 has a long diagonal available

After evaluating the position, I believe capturing the knight on h2 with my bishop is a strong move. This captures a piece and maintains my bishop's activity.

I need to analyze the position carefully before making my move.

Looking at the board, I notice:
- I have a bishop on h2 that's attacking diagonally
- My king is on f8 with a rook on g8
- White has a rook on c7 threatening my position
- I have knights on d8 and e6

Among my options, I see some strong possibilities:
- The bishop on h2 has several good moves, particularly h2e5 which would attack White's queen on b2
- Knight e6 has mobility and could develop to better squares
- I could castle by playing g8h8

After evaluation, I believe the strongest move is to move my bishop to e5, putting pressure on White's queen.

After analyzing the position and available moves, I need to make a strategic decision.

I notice I have two bishops (on a8 and e5), two knights (on d8 and e6), and my king is on f8. White has a rook on c7 that's attacking my a7 pawn, and I need to address this threat while improving my position.

One of my strongest pieces is the bishop on e5, which is well-positioned on the diagonal. I also see that my knight on e6 has good mobility.

Looking at the most promising moves:
- The bishop on e5 can move to h2, putting pressure on White's position
- The knight on e6 can move to c5 or g5, developing further into the game
- I could also consider king safety with g8h8 or g8g7

I'll choose to move my bishop from e5 to h2, which puts pressure on White's position while maintaining my strong diagonal control.

The most critical move appears to be with my bishop on h2, which is putting pressure on the white king's position. I can either capture the bishop on e5 or move to f4 to maintain pressure.

I'll choose to capture the bishop on e5, which removes a defender and maintains pressure on White's position.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

After analyzing the position and my legal moves, I see several key factors:

1. I have two bishops (on a8 and e6), two knights (on d8 and e5), and my king is on f8
2. White has a rook on c7 that's attacking my a7 pawn
3. My e5 knight is well-positioned with many options

The knight on e5 is particularly strong, controlling several important squares. I should consider using it to create threats or improve my position further.

Looking at the best candidates:
- e5g4 would attack White's queen, but it's not in the legal moves list
- e5f3 could fork pieces, but it's not available
- e5c4 would be a good outpost, but not available

Among the available moves, I think the best is to develop my light-squared bishop with:

Player_Black (to Proxy):

I apologize for the error. Let me check the legal moves again and make a valid move.

Looking at the legal moves list, I see that e6c4 isn't actually legal. Let me select a better move from the available options.

The bishop on e6 has several good options. Moving it to c4 would be strong, but since that's not legal, let me consider e6d4, which attacks the pawn on c5 and maintains control of important central squares.

3. My king on f8 needs attention
4. I have a bishop on h2 that's deep in White's territory

Looking at my options, I notice the bishop on h2 has several strong moves. In particular, I can play Bh2-e5, which:
- Attacks White's queen on g7
- Creates a strong central presence
- Threatens to fork White's king and rook with a potential Nd4-f3+ later

This is a tactical opportunity I should capitalize on.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

After analyzing the position, I see several strong options as Black. 

I notice I have two knights (on d4 and d8), two bishops (on a8 and e5), and my king is on f8. White has a queen on g7 that's quite active, and a rook on c7 that's penetrated my position.

One of my best moves appears to be capturing the white knight on h2 with my bishop: e5h2. This wins material cleanly as the knight is undefended.

Another strong option is Nf3+ (d4f3), which would give check to the white king on f2 and potentially fork another piece.

After careful consideration, I'll capture the free knight.

1. Material is roughly even, with both sides having significant pieces
2. My king on f8 is somewhat exposed with the white rook on c8
3. I have two knights (on e8 and f5) and two bishops (on a8 and h2)
4. White's queen is on e5, potentially threatening pieces

The knight on f5 is well-positioned and has several good options. One particularly strong move is to attack White's queen with Nd4, which would force the queen to move and gain tempo.

I see that I'm playing as Black and the position is quite complex. Looking at the board:
- I have knights on d4 and e8
- My king is on f8 with a rook on g8
- White has a queen on e5 and a king on f6

Key observations:
- My knight on d4 is very active and has several good options
- The knight on d4 can fork White's pieces with the move d4f5, which would attack both the king on f6 and the queen on e5

This is a powerful tactical opportunity - a knight fork attacking both the king and queen simultaneously. This is a winning move.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

After analyzing the position, I can see I'm playing as Black with several pieces under attack. My rook on g8 is under attack by a white rook on b8, and I need to address this immediate threat.

Looking at my options, I notice I have a knight on f5 that has several good moves. I also need to consider the safety of my king on f8.

One of the strongest moves appears to be moving my knight from f5 to g7, which defends my king while attacking the white rook on b8. This creates a counter-threat and protects my king's position.

- White has a queen on e5 which is quite active
- I need to consider both safety and development

Looking at my options:
- Moving my bishop from a8 could develop a piece
- Knight moves from g7 could improve my position
- Pawn moves are also available

After evaluating the position, I'll develop my bishop to improve my position:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

I need to analyze the position carefully before making my move.

Looking at the board, I'm playing as Black and I notice:
- My king is on f8 with a rook on g8 and bishop on h8
- White has a queen on e5 which is quite active
- I have knights on d8 and g7, bishops on b7 and h8
- The position appears somewhat complex

Among my legal moves, I should consider:
- Knight moves (g7e8, g7e6, g7h5, g7f5)
- Bishop moves (b7c8, b7a8, b7c6, b7a6, b7d5)
- Pawn moves (h7h6, f7f6, a7a6, h7h5, f7f5, a7a5)

The knight on g7 is currently protecting my king from the white queen on e5. Moving it could be dangerous unless there's a strong tactical reason. The bishop on b7 has good mobility.

After evaluating the options, I'll make a solid move that improves my position without creating weaknesses:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Let me analyze the position and my available moves:

I'm playing as Black, and I notice several key aspects of the position:
- My king is on f8 with a rook on g7
- White has a queen on f3 which could be dangerous
- I have knights on d8 and g7, bishops on b7 and h8
- Material seems roughly equal

Looking at my legal moves:
- King moves: f8e8 (moving my king to safety)
- Knight moves: g7e8, g7e6, g7h5, g7f5 (my knight on g7 has several options)
- Bishop moves: b7c8, b7a8, b7c6, b7d5 (my bishop on b7 has mobility)
- Pawn moves: h7h6, f7f6, a6a5, h7h5, f7f5 (various pawn advances)

The most pressing concern is my king's safety. Moving my king to e8 gets it away from the edge of the board and improves its position. This is a solid, safe move that improves my king's position.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

I'll analyze the position and my available moves:

The position appears to be in the middlegame/endgame phase. As Black, I need to consider:
1. My king safety (currently on e8)
2. The activity of my pieces
3. Any immediate threats

Looking at the legal moves:
- King moves: e8f8, e8d7
- Knight moves: g7e6, g7h5, g7f5
- Bishop moves: b7c8, b7a8, b7c6, b7d5
- Pawn moves: h7h6, f7f6, a6a5, h7h5, f7f5

I notice my king is in the center, which is generally unsafe. Moving the king to f8 would improve safety and connect my rooks. The move g8f8 would also be a rook move that helps control the f-file.

After consideration, I'll move my king to f8 to improve its safety and prepare to connect my rooks.

Looking at the legal moves, I see several key options:
- f8e8: Moving my king to e8
- g7e8/e6/h5/f5: Knight moves
- b7 moves: Developing my bishop
- Pawn moves like f7f6 or h7h6

Given that my king is somewhat exposed, I'll prioritize king safety and make a move that improves my position.

I see that I have three legal moves as Black:
1. e8f8 - Moving my king from e8 to f8
2. e8d7 - Moving my king from e8 to d7
3. g7e6 - Moving my knight from g7 to e6

Let me analyze the position:
- I'm playing as Black and my king is on e8
- White's queen is on e4, creating pressure
- I have a knight on g7 that can move to e6
- My king can move to either f8 or d7

The knight move to e6 looks interesting as it develops the piece to a central square. However, I need to be careful about any potential threats.

Moving my king to f8 seems safest, as it keeps my king protected while I assess the position further. The d7 square could potentially be more exposed.

I'll make my move:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

I can see all my legal moves now. Let me analyze the position:

I'm playing as Black and have several knight and bishop moves available, along with some pawn advances. Looking at the board:

1. My king on f8 seems relatively safe
2. I have a knight on g7 that has several possible moves
3. I have a bishop on b7 that can move in several directions
4. I have pawns that can advance on a6, h7, and f7

The most active and developing move appears to be moving my bishop to c6, which would put pressure on the center and potentially target White's pieces. This improves my piece activity and controls important central squares.

I'm playing as Black and I notice:
- I have a material advantage with two bishops, two knights, and a rook
- My king on f8 seems relatively safe
- White has a queen on e5 which is quite active
- I have several knight moves available from both g7 and c6

Looking at the most promising moves:
- Knight c6 to d5 looks strong, attacking White's queen on e5
- Knight g7 to e6 could develop the piece to a good central square
- Bishop c6 to e8 could help consolidate my position

The most pressing concern is White's queen on e5, which is threatening my position. I should address this threat.

I'll play the knight move to d5, which directly attacks the queen and improves my position.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

After analyzing the position, I can see I'm playing as Black with several pieces including a king on f8, knights on d8 and g7, bishops on h8 and d5, a rook on g8, and some pawns.

The position looks complex with White having a queen on e5 that's creating pressure. My bishop on d5 is particularly active and has many potential moves.

I'll make a strategic decision based on the current position:

The bishop on d5 is my most active piece with many options. I notice it can capture White's knight on h1, which would be a material gain. This also keeps my bishop active on a long diagonal.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

I need to analyze the position carefully before making my move.

Looking at the board, I see that:
- I'm playing as Black with my king on f6
- White has a queen on b3 and a bishop on f2
- I have two knights (d8 and g7) and two bishops (h1 and h8)
- Material seems roughly equal, but I need to consider tactical threats

The most critical aspects I need to consider are:
1. King safety
2. Tactical opportunities
3. Development of my pieces

After analyzing the position, I see that my bishop on h1 has good mobility and can potentially create threats. Moving it to e4 would put pressure on White's position and develop the piece to a more active square.

The bishop on e4 is particularly strong, and I notice it can capture on h1. This appears to be a free piece capture.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

I need to analyze the position carefully before making my move.

Looking at the board, I notice:
- I'm playing as Black and have a knight on g7 that could develop
- There's a white rook on a7 that's attacking my a-pawn
- I have a bishop on a8 with several possible moves
- My knight on d8 also has mobility options

The most pressing issue is the white rook on a7 threatening my a6 pawn. I should either defend it or make a counter-threat.

One strong move is to develop my bishop with a8b7, which would defend my a6 pawn while also controlling the long diagonal.

Another good option is to develop my knight with g7e6, which would protect the f8 square near my king and prepare for further development.

After consideration, I'll develop my bishop to b7, defending my pawn and activating this piece.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

I need to analyze this position carefully. 

I'm playing as Black and I see that:
- I have my king on f8 with a rook on g8 and bishop on h8
- I have knights on d8 and g7
- I have a bishop on b7
- I have pawns on a6, f7, and h7
- White has a rook on a7 that's attacking my a-file

Looking at my legal moves, I need to consider my priorities:
1. King safety
2. Piece coordination
3. Counterattack opportunities

The knight on g7 has several good options. Moving it to e6 would centralize it and protect the f8 square near my king. The bishop on b7 is also very active with many diagonal options.

After consideration, I'll move my knight from g7 to e6, which centralizes it, protects my king's position, and creates threats in White's position.

Looking at my options, I notice my bishop on b7 has several strong diagonal moves. In particular, I can capture White's knight on h1 with b7h1, which would be a free piece.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Looking at the board and my legal moves, I need to make a strategic decision as Black.

I notice I'm playing with a material advantage (I have a bishop on g1, two knights, and a rook), but my king on f8 is somewhat exposed. White has a rook on a7, a queen on f1, and a bishop on f2 that could be threatening.

One of my strongest moves would be to improve my rook's position by moving it to the open g-file, which would increase my control of the board and potentially create threats.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

I need to analyze this position carefully. 

I see that I'm playing as Black and have several pieces: king on f8, knights on d8 and e6, pawns on a6, f7, and h7, a rook on g2, and a bishop on g1.

White has a king on d3, rook on a7, knights on h4 and b1, bishop on g6, queen on f1, and pawns on a4, b4, and d7.

Looking at the legal moves, I notice:
- My rook on g2 is active and threatening along the g-file
- My bishop on g1 is well positioned
- My knight on e6 has several good options

The most critical decision is what to do with my rook on g2, which appears to be putting pressure on White's position. I could also consider knight moves to create threats.

I'll play my rook to e2, putting direct pressure on White's king:

After analyzing the position, I see several strong options. I notice my rook on e2 is active and could be used effectively. I also have two knights that could be repositioned for better coordination.

Looking at the position critically:
1. My rook on e2 is threatening the white king's position
2. I have a bishop on g1 that's well placed
3. My knights on e6 and d8 could be better coordinated

The move e2e1 looks particularly strong as it maintains pressure along the e-file and prepares a potential back-rank checkmate threat. This keeps my rook active while maintaining pressure on White's position.

Looking at the legal moves, I notice I can move my king, knights, bishop, or pawns. The most pressing concern is safety, as White has some attacking pieces.

The knight on e6 appears to be well-positioned and could potentially fork pieces. Moving my bishop at g1 could develop it further. My king also has some mobility.

After evaluating the position, I think the best move is to develop my bishop from g1 to e3, which puts pressure on White's king on e5.

You are a professional chess player and you play as black. Now is your turn to make a move. Before making a move you can pick one of the following actions:
- 'get_current_board' to get the schema and current status of the board
- 'get_legal_moves' to get a UCI formatted list of available moves
- 'make_move <UCI formatted move>' when you are ready to complete your turn (e.g., 'make_move e2e4')

Player_Black (to Proxy):

I need to analyze this position carefully. I'm playing as Black and need to make the best move.

Looking at the board:
- I have my king on f8 with a knight on d8
- White has a rook on a8 that could be dangerous
- I have two knights (d8 and e6) and a bishop on f2
- White's king is on e4 with a queen on d4

Key considerations:
- My bishop on f2 is attacking White's queen on d4
- I should check if there are any tactical opportunities or immediate threats

The move f2d4 looks very strong as it captures White's queen. Let me make that move.

The most critical factor is that my bishop on d4 is attacking the white king on e5. I should capitalize on this tactical opportunity.

2. I have knights on d8 and e6 that could be developed
3. My king on f8 can move to safety

The most critical move is addressing the check I'm delivering with my bishop. I should consider whether to maintain the check or make a different strong move.

Since my bishop is attacking the white king, and the king is quite exposed, I'll maintain pressure by moving the bishop to a safe square while keeping the check.

Proxy (to Player_Black):

f8g8,f8g7,f4d6

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

I can see I have three legal moves as Black:

1. f8g8 - Moving my king from f8 to g8
2. f8g7 - Moving my king from f8 to g7
3. f4d6 - Moving my bishop from f4 to d6

Let me analyze the position:
- I have a bishop on f4 that's currently attacking the white king on e5
- I have two knights (on d8 and e6)
- White has a bishop on d4, a rook on a8, and knights on h5 and c1
- My king is on f8

The move f4d6 would move my bishop away from controlling the e5 square where the white king is, which seems disadvantageous.

The king moves are both to the kingside. Moving to g7 would put my king on the same diagonal as the white bishop on d4, which could be dangerous. Moving to g8 keeps my king safer.

I'll choose to move my king to g8, which appears to be the safest option.

- I have knights on d8 and e6
- I have a bishop on f4 which is attacking White's king on e5
- White has a rook on a8, a bishop on d6, and knights on g7 and c3

Looking at my options, I notice my bishop on f4 is delivering a check to White's king. This is a powerful position that I should capitalize on. I have several bishop moves that maintain the check while potentially improving my position.

The move f4e3 looks particularly strong as it maintains the check while moving to a safer square (the bishop is currently undefended on f4). This diagonal also controls important squares.

Looking at my options:
1. My bishop on e3 is very active and controls important diagonals
2. I have a knight on e6 that could potentially fork pieces
3. My king's safety is important

The most promising move appears to be my bishop on e3 threatening White's king. I can check the White king with:

I need to analyze this position carefully as Black. Here's what I see:

1. I have my king on g8 with potential moves to h8 or g7
2. I have knights on d8 and e6
3. I have a bishop on f4 which is attacking White's king on e5
4. White has a bishop on d4, knights on f6 and c3, and a rook on a8

The most striking feature is that my bishop on f4 is attacking White's king on e5. This could be a check or even a potential checkmate opportunity.

Looking at my legal moves, I notice that moving the bishop with f4e3 would maintain the attack on the king while potentially setting up a stronger position.

I'll make this move:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

I need to analyze this position carefully. As Black, I have several pieces to consider:
- My king on g8
- Two knights on d8 and e6
- A bishop on e3
- Pawns on a7, f7, and h7

White has:
- King on e5
- Rook on a8
- Bishop on d6
- Knights on c3 and h1
- Several pawns

Looking at the position, my bishop on e3 is very active and pins White's king to the back rank. I should consider how to maximize this advantage.

The knight on e6 is also well-placed, controlling several important squares. My king needs to stay safe.

After evaluating the options, I'll play my bishop to capture on f2, which threatens to promote to a queen next move if not addressed. This creates a decisive advantage.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Let me analyze the position:

I'm playing as Black and I see I have two knights (on e6 and d8), a bishop on f2, my king on g8, and pawns on a7, f7, and h7. White has a rook on a8, a bishop on e5, knights on c2 and g1, the king on e4, and pawns on a4, b5, and d4.

Looking at my options:
- My bishop on f2 is active and threatening several squares
- My knight on e6 has multiple options
- My king can move to h8 or g7

The most critical assessment is that my king is on the back rank with the white rook on a8. I should consider the safety of my king first.

I notice my bishop on f2 is very active and could potentially deliver a check by moving to e3. This would force the white king to move and give me the initiative.

After careful consideration, I'll play:

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Now I have a clear picture of the position and my available moves. Let me analyze the situation:

I'm playing as Black and have several pieces in active positions:
- My king is on g8
- I have knights on d8 and e6
- I have a bishop on e3
- I have pawns on a7, f7, and h7

Looking at the position, I notice my bishop on e3 is attacking the white king on e5, which is a powerful piece to have. I should consider how to maximize this advantage.

Among my options:
1. I could move my bishop to capture something or improve its position
2. I could move my knight on e6 to a better square
3. I could make a king move for safety

The bishop on e3 is my most active piece, putting pressure on White's king. Moving it to f4 would maintain the attack on the king while also controlling important squares.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

After analyzing the position and my legal moves, I can see several key factors:

1. I'm playing as Black with my king on g8
2. White has a dangerous attack with a rook on a8, bishop on e5, and knights on h6 and c1
3. I have knights on e6 and d8, a bishop on f4, and pawns on a7, f7, and h7
4. White's king is on d4, which could be vulnerable

Looking at my options, I notice my bishop on f4 has several strong moves. It can attack White's position and potentially create threats.

I'll play:

make_move f4e3

This move attacks White's position while maintaining control of important squares. The bishop on e3 controls important diagonals and puts pressure on White's position while staying protected.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

I need to analyze this position carefully as Black.

Looking at the board:
- White has a rook on a8, bishop on d8, and king on d4
- Black has king on g8, knight on e6, bishop on e3, and pawns on a7, f7, and h7
- White also has pawns on a4, b5, d7 and knights on h6, c1

My king is in the corner with a white rook on a8 and bishop on d8 nearby, which is concerning. My knight on e6 and bishop on e3 are active pieces. I should use them effectively.

The knight on e6 can attack the white king on d4, which is a strong move. Moving my bishop to f4 would also put pressure on the white king.

After evaluating the options, I'll move my bishop to f4, putting direct pressure on the white king:

Now I can see all my legal moves. This is the opening phase of the game, and I need to develop my pieces and control the center.

After analyzing the position, I'll play the knight to f6, which is a standard developing move in response to White's c4 (English Opening). This knight move helps control the center, prepares for castling, and is in line with sound opening principles.

Now I can see all my legal moves. Let me analyze the position and make a strategic decision:

The position is in the early opening stage. As Black, I should focus on development, controlling the center, and ensuring king safety.

Key considerations:
- Developing my pieces (knights and bishops)
- Controlling central squares
- Preparing for castling

The most principled move here is to develop my knight to c6, which develops a piece, controls central squares (particularly d4), and follows good opening principles.

- I have the opportunity to castle kingside (e8g8)
- My knights are developed at c6 and f6
- White has a knight on h5 that could be threatening
- I have a pawn on e5 that could advance

Castling is often a priority to get the king to safety, and in this position it looks like a good option since my kingside is well-developed and the path is clear.

Thank you for providing the legal moves. Let me analyze the position:

I notice that:
1. White has played an early knight to h5 (unusual)
2. I have both knights developed and a bishop on e7
3. White has a pawn on c3 and has developed minimally

Looking at my options, I should continue development and consider castling. Since castling kingside is available (g8h8), that seems like a good choice to secure my king's safety.

2. h7g6 - Moving my pawn from h7 to g6
3. f7g6 - Moving my pawn from f7 to g6

Looking at the position, I notice that White has a knight on g6 that's attacking my position. I need to respond to this threat. Moving my king to g8 (h8g8) is the best option here as it gets my king out of potential danger and maintains my pawn structure.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

I need to analyze the position carefully before making my move.

Looking at the board, I notice:
- White has a knight on h5 that could be threatening my position
- My king is on g8 with no immediate checks
- I have knights on c6 and f6, bishops on c8 and e7, and my queen on d8
- There's a pawn tension in the center with e5 and e4 pawns

One strong candidate move is Nf6-e4, which would attack the center and potentially put pressure on White's position. This knight move would be active and could help control important central squares.

Another good option is developing my bishop with Be7-d6, improving my piece activity.

After consideration, I believe the knight move to e4 is most principled, attacking the center and increasing my piece activity.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

After analyzing the position, I see several good options. I notice I have two knights - one on c6 and one on e4, with the e4 knight being particularly active. I also see my dark-squared bishop on e7 has several possible moves.

The e4 knight is particularly strong, attacking White's bishop on c3. Taking that bishop would be valuable. Additionally, I notice my king is still in the center, so castling could be a good defensive move.

After evaluating the options, I'll capture White's bishop with my knight:

I can see the current board position. Let me analyze the situation:

As Black, I notice:
- My king is on g8
- I'm missing a knight on f8 (likely captured)
- White has a bishop on c4 that's attacking my f7 pawn
- I have knights on c6 and c3 (the c3 knight is deep in White's territory)
- White has a knight on h5

Let me check my legal moves to make a good decision.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Thank you for the list of legal moves. Let me analyze the position and make a strategic decision.

Looking at the position, I notice several important factors:
- My knight on c3 is deep in White's territory and quite active
- White's bishop on c4 is targeting my f7 pawn
- I should consider developing my pieces and improving my king's safety

After careful consideration, I believe one of the strongest moves is to develop my bishop on e7 to a more active square. The move e7d6 looks particularly good as it maintains protection of my f7 pawn while developing the bishop to a more active diagonal.

One of the strongest moves here is to develop my rook to e8, connecting my rooks and preparing for potential action in the center or on the kingside.

1. White has a bishop on c4 that's attacking my position
2. I have knights on c6 and d5 that could be developed further
3. My king is on e8 and I have the option to castle kingside (e8g8)

Castling kingside would be a good move here to improve my king safety. This would connect my rooks and move my king to a safer position.

I apologize for the error. Let me check the legal moves again and make a valid move.

Looking at the position again, I see that I can develop my knight on d5 to f4, which puts pressure on the center and potentially threatens White's position.

Looking at the knight on f4, it has several good options, including the fork possibility with Nd5 which could attack White's queen and possibly another piece. This seems like a strong tactical opportunity.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

I need to analyze the position carefully before making my move.

Looking at the board, I see that:
- I'm playing as Black
- White has a bishop on c4 threatening my f7 pawn
- I have knights on c6 and d5, bishops on c8 and d6
- My king is on g8 with rooks on a8 and h8
- There's a pawn on e5 that could be vulnerable

One of my priorities should be king safety. I notice my king is exposed on g8 with the f7 pawn being a potential weakness. I should also develop my pieces and improve my position.

Among the legal moves, I see several good options:
1. g8f8 - Moving my king to f8 to protect the f7 pawn
2. e5e4 - Advancing my e-pawn to gain space
3. d6e7 - Repositioning my bishop to a more active diagonal

After consideration, I think the best move is to castle by hand (since I can't castle normally anymore) by moving my king to f8, which protects the f7 pawn and improves king safety.

After analyzing the position, I can see several interesting options:

1. I have a knight on c6 that could develop to e7 or d4
2. My bishop on d5 has several active squares
3. I could castle kingside with either h8g8 or f8g8
4. My queen has mobility options

Given that my king is still in the center and White has some active pieces, I should prioritize king safety. Castling kingside is a strong move here.

- My king is on g8 with rooks on a8 and h8
- I have knights on c6 and d5, bishops on c8 and d6
- There's a pawn tension in the center with my e5 pawn

One of my strongest pieces, the knight on d5, is well-positioned and controls several important squares. I should consider if it's under threat or if I can use it to create threats.

The move d5e3 looks particularly interesting as it would fork White's queen and rook. This would be a powerful tactical shot.

I'll analyze the position and my available moves:

The position shows I'm playing as Black with a fairly developed position. White has a queen on d4 and knights on e3 and b2. I need to consider both defensive needs and potential counterplay.

Key observations:
- My king is on g8 with rooks on b8 and h8
- I have knights on c6 and bishops on c8 and d6
- The e5 pawn is under attack by White's c3 pawn
- I should consider king safety and development

Among my options:
- Knight moves like c6e7 could improve piece positioning
- King moves like g8f8 might improve king safety
- Pawn moves like e5e4 could gain space
- Bishop moves like d6e7 could protect the knight

After evaluation, I believe developing my light-squared bishop with:

I'll analyze the position to make the best move as Black.

Looking at the board, I notice:
- I have a knight on d4 that's quite active in White's territory
- My pawn structure is mostly intact
- White has a queen on d3 and knights on e5 and b2

Among my options, the knight on d4 has several strong moves. The move Nd4-f3+ looks particularly powerful as it:
1. Gives check to the White king
2. Forks the king and rook on e1
3. After the king moves, I can capture the rook

I'll analyze the position as Black:

The position appears to be in the middle game with an interesting tactical situation. I notice my knight on f3 is active and could potentially create threats. My king is castled kingside, and I have a bishop pair (e7 and c8).

Looking at the legal moves, I see several strong options:
- Knight moves from f3 could attack White's pieces
- Advancing the e5 pawn to e4 could gain space
- Bishop moves from e7 could improve my piece activity

The knight on f3 is particularly well-placed and could create threats. The move f3d4 looks especially strong as it attacks White's queen on d4 and could force it to retreat.

- My king is on g8 with a rook on h8
- White has doubled pawns on g3 and h3
- White's queen is on d3, which could be threatening

The knight on d4 is my most active piece, and it has several good options. The move d4f3 looks particularly strong as it:
1. Attacks White's queen on d3
2. Threatens a fork if White's queen moves (could potentially hit the king and rook)
3. Puts pressure on White's position

I'll make this move:

I need to analyze this position carefully. 

I notice I'm playing as Black and have a knight on d2 that's deep in White's territory. This is an unusual position that could be advantageous. The knight on d2 is currently attacking White's queen on c3 and can make several moves.

Looking at the overall position, my king safety is important, and I should consider developing my pieces effectively. The knight on d2 is already active but potentially vulnerable.

One strong move would be to capture White's queen with my knight:

- I could advance pawns to gain space

The knight on c4 is particularly well-placed and could jump to e3, which would be a strong square threatening White's position. This move would increase pressure in the center and potentially create tactical opportunities.

1. I have a knight on e3 that's very active in White's territory
2. My e5 pawn is under attack by White's d4 pawn
3. I have an undeveloped rook on h8
4. My king is on g8 with some pawn protection

Looking at my options, I should consider:
- Defending the e5 pawn
- Improving my knight's position on e3
- Developing my remaining pieces

The knight on e3 is particularly strong and can make several good moves. I think the best move is to capture White's pawn on g2, which threatens White's rook and creates tactical opportunities.

- 'get_legal_moves' to get a UCI formatted list of available moves
- 'make_move <UCI formatted move>' when you are ready to complete your turn (e.g., 'make_move e2e4')

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

After analyzing the position and my legal moves, I see several interesting options:

1. I have a knight on g2 that's actively placed in White's territory
2. My king is on g8 and could castle by hand with Kf8
3. I have a bishop on e7 with several diagonal options
4. I can advance various pawns

The knight on g2 looks particularly active and I should consider how to best use it. It's threatening White's queen on b2 and could also move to e3 or e1 for other threats.

Looking at the overall position, I think the most active and strong move is to use my knight to attack White's queen:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Thank you for providing the legal moves. Let me analyze the position:

I'm playing as Black and I notice several key aspects of the position:
- My king is on g8 with a rook on h8 (castled kingside)
- I have a bishop on e7 that has several good diagonal options
- White has a queen on b2 that could be threatening
- There's some pawn tension in the center with my e5 pawn

Looking at my options, developing my bishop on e7 to a more active square seems strong. The bishop can move to f6, which would protect my g7 pawn and control important central squares.

I'll make this move:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

I need to analyze the position carefully before making my move.

Looking at the board, I notice:
- I'm playing as Black and have a standard piece setup, though some pieces have moved
- White has advanced some pawns in the center (b4, c4, d4)
- My e-pawn has advanced to e5
- My bishop is developed to f6
- White's queen is on a1 and has a rook on a3

I have several reasonable options:

1. Castle kingside with `g8f8` or `g8e8` to improve king safety
2. Develop my queen with moves like `d8e7`
3. Continue development with moves like `b8a8` (rook)
4. Advance my e-pawn with `e5e4` to gain space

Given the position, I think castling is a priority for king safety, and the kingside looks safer since White has some activity on the queenside.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Looking at the position, I need to make a strategic decision. I notice:

1. I'm playing as Black and appear to be in a middle game position
2. My king is on g8 with a rook on f8 - castling has already happened
3. White has some pressure in the center with pawns on b4, c4, d4
4. I have a pawn on e5 that's currently under attack by White's d4 pawn

Given these observations, I should address the central tension. My e5 pawn is hanging, so I should either defend it or push it forward to create counterplay.

I'll advance the e-pawn to challenge White's center:

Now I understand the position and my available moves. Let me analyze the situation:

1. White's queen is on e5, creating pressure on my position
2. I have both bishops developed, but my king is exposed without castling
3. White has advanced pawns in the center (b3, c3, d3)
4. My e-pawn has advanced to e4

One of my most urgent priorities is to castle and secure my king's safety. I have two castling options available: kingside (h8g8) or queenside (b8a8). Given the position, kingside castling looks safer as there's less immediate pressure on that side.

- My king is on g8 with a rook on f8
- White has a rook on d3 that could be threatening my position
- I have a pawn on e4 that's advanced

Among my options:
- The bishop on e5 has many possible moves
- I could develop my queen with moves like Qd8-e7 or Qd8-f6
- I could consider kingside castling with Kg8-h8

The bishop on e5 is well-placed, attacking White's position. Moving my queen to f6 (d8f6) looks strong as it develops the queen to an active square, puts pressure on White's position, and maintains control of the center.

After analyzing the position, I can see several key elements:

1. I have two bishops - one on e5 attacking diagonally and one on f8
2. My queen is on f6 with several potential moves
3. White has a rook on d3 that could be targeted

One of the strongest moves I see is to use my bishop on e5 to capture White's bishop on h2, which appears to be undefended.

1. I have a bishop on h2 that can make some strong moves
2. My queen on f6 has many options
3. I need to consider both attacking opportunities and defensive needs

The bishop on h2 has a powerful diagonal and can attack White's position with h2g3, threatening the white king. This looks like a very strong move as it puts immediate pressure on White.

I notice I have my queen on f6 with many possible moves, and a bishop on g3 that's attacking along the diagonal. The position appears to be in the middlegame with an interesting tactical situation.

Looking at the strongest moves:
- My queen on f6 has many options, including potential attacks
- My bishop on g3 is well placed and has several good squares
- I should consider my king's safety (currently on g8)

I'll make a strong move with my queen to attack White's position:

I need to analyze this position carefully. 

I notice that:
- I'm playing as Black with my king on g8
- White has a strong attack with pieces aimed at my kingside
- My queen is on e5, actively placed in the center
- I have a bishop on g3 that's attacking White's kingside

Looking at the legal moves, I see several promising options:

1. The bishop on g3 has several attacking options
2. My queen on e5 has many possible moves
3. I can make defensive moves with my pawns

After evaluating the position, I believe the most active and threatening move is to attack White's king with my bishop.

One particularly strong move is to play my queen to e6, which maintains pressure on the position while protecting the e-pawn and potentially preparing for future tactics.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

After analyzing the position, I can see I'm playing as Black with a fairly complex middlegame position. I have my queen on e6, and I notice my bishop on h2 has some interesting diagonal possibilities.

Looking at the legal moves, I see several strong options:
- My queen on e6 has many potential moves
- My bishop on h2 has tactical possibilities
- I could develop my rooks

The most striking opportunity I see is my bishop on h2 targeting White's kingside. The move h2g3 looks particularly strong as it attacks White's king on g7 while being protected by my queen on e6.

Looking at the board, I notice:
- I'm playing as Black
- White has a rook on d4 that's attacking my e-pawn
- My queen is on e6 with many available moves
- I have a bishop on g3 that could develop further

The e4 pawn is under attack, but I can't easily defend it. Instead of trying to save this pawn, I should look to create counterplay or improve my position.

One strong move would be to use my queen to attack White's position. The move `e6a6` looks particularly strong as it attacks the a-pawn while also creating threats along the 6th rank.

- My bishop on g3 is well-positioned, attacking diagonals
- White has a rook on d4 that's somewhat advanced
- There's a pawn on e4 that appears to be mine

Among my legal moves, I see several promising options:
1. Developing my rook with f8e8
2. Using my queen for attack with a6e6 (controlling the e-file)
3. Moving my bishop with g3h2 to attack White's position

After consideration, I'll develop my rook to the e-file, which improves my piece coordination and prepares for potential attacks.

You are a professional chess player and you play as black. Now is your turn to make a move. Before making a move you can pick one of the following actions:
- 'get_current_board' to get the schema and current status of the board
- 'get_legal_moves' to get a UCI formatted list of available moves
- 'make_move <UCI formatted move>' when you are ready to complete your turn (e.g., 'make_move e2e4')

Player_Black (to Proxy):

After analyzing the position and my available legal moves, I notice several key factors:

1. I have a bishop on f2 that's attacking the white king on g1
2. My queen on e6 has many available moves
3. I have a pawn on e4 that appears to be advanced

Looking at the position, I see a strong tactical opportunity with my bishop on f2. Since it's already attacking the white king, I can deliver a decisive check by moving it to e1, which would be a discovered check from my queen on e6 along the e-file. This is a powerful double attack.

1. I have both bishops, a queen, both rooks, and my king
2. White has a rook on d4 attacking my e-pawn
3. I have a bishop on e1 that appears to be threatening something
4. My queen is on e5

Let me check what legal moves I have available.

After analyzing the position and the legal moves available, I see several key considerations:

1. My e4 pawn is under attack by White's rook on d4
2. I have a bishop on e1 with several good diagonal moves
3. My queen on e6 has many possible moves
4. My king on g8 is relatively safe

One of the strongest moves I see is to use my bishop on e1, which is aiming at White's position. The move e1f2 looks particularly strong as it would attack White's king on g1 and the knight on h2 simultaneously, creating a fork.

I notice my queen on e6 has many possible moves, and my bishop on f2 is attacking along the diagonal. The position looks somewhat complex with material appearing roughly equal.

One strong move I see is to increase the pressure on the e-file by connecting my rooks:

I need to analyze the position carefully before making my move.

I notice several key aspects:
- I'm playing as Black and have my queen on e6
- White has a knight on e5 threatening my queen
- I have a bishop on g3 that could capture the knight on e5
- My king is on g8 with a rook on e7 that's pinned to my king

The most pressing issue is the knight on e5 threatening my queen. I can either move the queen or capture the knight with my bishop.

Capturing the knight with g3xe5 seems strong as it removes a centralized piece and relieves the pressure on my queen. This also opens the g-file for potential counterplay.

Looking at the position, I see White has a rook on d4 that's quite active, and another rook on b2. I should consider both defensive needs and attacking opportunities.

One strong move would be to activate my queen with:

make_move e6g4

This move puts pressure on White's position, threatens the c4 square, and maintains control of important central squares. The queen is well-positioned here to support potential attacks while staying relatively safe.

After analyzing the position and available moves, I can see I'm playing as Black and have several tactical opportunities.

Key observations:
- My king is on g8 with limited mobility
- I have a queen on g4 that appears to be active
- I have a bishop on e5 that's attacking diagonally
- White has a rook on d4 that could be threatened

One of the strongest moves appears to be attacking White's king with my queen:

After analyzing the position and the legal moves available, I see several strong options. 

I notice I have a queen on f3 with many possible moves, and two bishops - one on e5 that's actively placed and another on b8. The position looks complex with material appearing roughly equal.

One of the most attractive moves is to use my bishop on e5 to attack the white king's position. The move e5g3 looks particularly strong as it attacks the h2 square next to the white king on g1, potentially setting up a mating attack.

I need to analyze the position carefully. I see I'm playing as Black and there appears to be a complex middlegame position.

Key observations:
- I have my queen on f3, which is actively placed
- I have a bishop on g3 that seems to be attacking diagonally
- White has a rook on d4 and another on b2
- My king is on g8 with a rook on e7

Looking at the legal moves, I should prioritize safety and activity. My queen on f3 has many options, and the bishop on g3 is also quite active.

I notice that my queen on f3 can move to g4, which would increase pressure on White's position while maintaining the queen's activity. This looks like a strong move that maintains pressure.

Let me analyze the position and make a strategic decision:

1. I notice my king is on g8 with a rook on b8 and e7
2. White has a dangerous attack with bishops on b4 and f6, plus rooks on d4 and h1
3. My bishop on g3 is actively placed and could create threats

Looking at my options:
- The bishop on g3 has several strong diagonal moves (g3e5 would attack White's position)
- My rook on e7 has mobility and could create threats
- I need to improve my king's safety

I'll move my bishop to e5, which attacks White's position while maintaining control of important diagonals.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

I need to analyze this position carefully. As Black, I have several key considerations:

1. My king is on g8 with limited mobility
2. I have a bishop on e5 that's actively placed
3. White has a bishop on f6 that could be threatening
4. I have a pawn on d3 that's advanced and potentially strong
5. My rook on e7 is active

Looking at the legal moves, I notice my bishop on e5 has several good options. It's currently attacking White's rook on d4, which is a valuable piece. I should consider capturing it or making another strong move.

The advanced d3 pawn is also important to consider - it could be promoted with further advancement.

After evaluating the position, I'll capture the rook with my bishop:

Now I have a clear picture of the position and my available moves. Let me analyze the situation:

I'm playing as Black and have several pieces: king on g8, rooks on b8 and e7, a bishop on d4, and several pawns.

Looking at the position, I notice:
1. My bishop on d4 has several good diagonal moves available
2. My rook on e7 is active and has multiple options
3. White has bishops on b4, c3, and d3, and the white king is on g1

One of my strongest moves appears to be using my bishop to create a tactical threat. The bishop on d4 can move to f6, which would attack White's g7 pawn while also creating pressure on that diagonal.

I'll make this move:

I'll prioritize active piece development and control of key squares. The rook on e7 is already well-placed on an open file, and I can use it to increase pressure.

I'll move my rook from e7 to e3, attacking White's e-pawn and gaining activity in the center of the board. This puts immediate pressure on White's position.

Looking at the position, I see that my king is on g8 and White's king is on e1. White has two bishops (on b4 and e5) and a rook on h1. I have material advantage with two rooks and a bishop.

The most powerful move appears to be to use my rook on e3 to attack White's king directly:

I apologize for the error. Let me check the legal moves again and make a valid move.

Looking at the position more carefully, I see that White's king is actually on e5, not e1 as I incorrectly stated. Let me choose a strong move from the legal moves list.

Since my rook on e3 is already in a good position attacking the e-file where White's king is, I'll use it to apply pressure by moving it to e2, pinning White's bishop against the king:

After analyzing the position, I see I'm playing as Black with a rook on b8, a bishop on f6, and my king on g8. White has a bishop on b4, a rook on h1, and the white king is on e2.

I notice my bishop on f6 is attacking White's pawn on g7, and I have several good options. One strong move would be to activate my rook by moving it to the open e-file, which would put pressure on White's king.

After analyzing the position, I see several key factors:

1. I'm playing as Black with my king on g8
2. White has a bishop on e5 attacking my position
3. I have a bishop on f6 that's active
4. White's king is on e2 and has a rook on h1

I notice my bishop on f6 has several good options, and there's a particularly strong tactical opportunity. The bishop on f6 can capture the pawn on g7, which appears to be a free pawn.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

I apologize for the error. Let me review the board again more carefully. It seems I misinterpreted the position. There is no pawn on g7 to capture. Let me check the legal moves again and make a better decision.

Looking at the legal moves list, I see I have options with my king, bishop on f6, and pawns. Let me make a more accurate assessment.

The bishop on f6 has several diagonal moves available. One strong option would be to move the bishop to e5, which would control more of the center and put pressure on White's position.

I can see that I'm playing as Black and I'm in a very limited position. Looking at the board:

1. My king is on g8
2. I have a rook on e8
3. I have a bishop on e4
4. I have pawns on a7, b7, c7, f7, g7, and h7
5. White has a king on e2, a rook on h1, a bishop on e5, and pawns on a4, b4, and h7

I only have one legal move available: g8h8, which is moving my king from g8 to h8.

Since this is my only option, I'll make this move:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

I need to analyze this position carefully. 

I'm playing as Black, and I notice:
- I have my king on h8 and a rook on e8
- I have a bishop on e5 that's attacking diagonally
- White has a bishop on e5 and a rook on b1
- White's king is on e2

Looking at my legal moves, I see I have several strong options:

1. The bishop on e5 has many possible moves and is currently attacking White's position
2. I could castle with e8g8 (O-O)
3. I have various pawn moves available

The most critical decision is what to do with my bishop on e5. It's currently in a strong position, attacking along the diagonal. I could capture something with it or reposition it to a more threatening square.

Given the position, I'll move my bishop to h2, which puts pressure on White's position and maintains my bishop's activity.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Now I can see all my legal moves. Let me analyze the position and make the best move:

I notice several key aspects of the position:
- I have a bishop on h2 that's deep in White's territory
- My rook on e8 is undefended and facing White's bishop on e7
- White's king is on e1 and rook on b1

Among my options:
1. The bishop on h2 has several good diagonal moves (h2-d6, h2-e5, h2-f4, h2-g3)
2. I could move my rook along the e-file or 8th rank
3. I have various pawn moves available

The most active piece is my bishop on h2, which is threatening White's king. Moving it to g3 would create a strong attack. This move maintains pressure and controls important squares near White's king.

I can see the current board position. I'm playing as Black and I notice I have a rook on c8, a king on h8, and a bishop on e1, along with several pawns. White has a rook on b1, a king on c1, and a bishop on e5, plus some pawns.

Let me check what legal moves I have available.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Now I have a clear picture of the position and my available moves. Let me analyze the situation:

1. I have my king on h8 and can move it to h7
2. My rook on c8 can move along the 8th rank
3. My bishop on e1 has several diagonal moves available
4. I have pawn moves available

Looking at the position, I notice my bishop on e1 is attacking White's king on c1. This is a check! I should capitalize on this tactical opportunity. The best move is to capture the white rook on b1 with my bishop, which maintains the check on the king and wins material.

1. Material: I have a rook, bishop, king, and several pawns
2. White has a rook, bishop, king, and some pawns
3. White's bishop is on e6, attacking my pawn on f7
4. My bishop is on b4
5. My rook is on c8
6. My king is on h8

Let me check what legal moves I have available.

Now I have a clear picture of my legal moves. Let me analyze the position and make a strategic decision:

1. White's bishop on e6 is threatening my f7 pawn
2. My bishop on b4 has several options, including capturing the bishop with b4e7
3. I have rook moves along the 8th rank
4. Various pawn moves are available

The most pressing issue is the bishop on e6 threatening my f7 pawn. I have two main options to address this:
- Capture the bishop with b4e7
- Defend the pawn with moves like f7f6

Capturing the bishop with b4e7 seems strongest as it eliminates the threat and gains material. This is a clear tactical opportunity.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

After analyzing the position, I see several good options. I notice my rook on c8 has control of the entire c-file and can move to several squares. My bishop on e7 also has multiple diagonal moves available.

Given that my king is somewhat exposed on h8, I should consider improving its safety. Moving the g7 pawn to g6 would create a small pawn shield and give my king some breathing room.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

I can see the current position and my legal moves. Let me analyze the situation:

I'm playing as Black and have:
- A king on h8
- A rook on c8
- A bishop on e7
- Pawns on a7, c7, f7, g6, and h7 (captured on board)

White has:
- A king on c2
- A rook on a1
- Pawns on a4, b2, and h7

Looking at my options, I notice I have control of the c-file with my rook. Since White's king is on c2, I can create pressure by moving my rook down the c-file. This would restrict White's king movement and potentially set up tactical opportunities.

I'll make this move:

Player_Black (to Proxy):

I apologize for the error. Let me check the legal moves again and make a valid move.

Looking at the list of legal moves I received, I see that c8c2 is not a legal move. Let me choose a strong move from the available options.

Since I have control of the c-file with my rook, I'll move it to c6, putting pressure on White's position and controlling more of the board:

make_move c8c6

I apologize for the confusion. Let me carefully review the list of legal moves again:

I see that c7c6 is a legal move, not c8c6. Let me make a strong move from the available options.

I'll advance my c-pawn to put pressure on White's position:

Looking at my options:
- I have a rook on c8 with many possible moves
- My bishop on e7 has multiple diagonal moves
- My king can move to h7 or g7
- I have several pawn moves available

The most active and developing move appears to be to centralize my rook on the open c-file, which could put pressure on White's position and potentially target the back rank.

Among my legal moves, I should consider:
- Improving my piece activity
- Keeping my king safe
- Potentially creating threats against White's pieces

The bishop on e7 has many diagonal options, and moving it to a more active square could be beneficial. Moving it to g5 would put it on a good diagonal.

After analyzing the position, I see that I'm playing as Black with my king on h8, a rook on c7, a bishop on c1, and several pawns. White has a king on b1 and a rook on b2.

I have a powerful bishop on c1 that can move in several directions. One of the strongest moves would be to attack the white king with my bishop.

Looking at the legal moves, I can play c1b2, which would capture White's rook and deliver check to the king. This is clearly the best move as it wins material and puts pressure on the opponent.

After analyzing the position, I see several key factors:

1. I'm playing as Black and have a material advantage with a rook, bishop, and pawns against White's king and pawns
2. My king is on h8 and White's king is on b1
3. I have a bishop on b2 that's currently attacking along the a1-h8 diagonal
4. I have a rook on c7 that could be developed

The most powerful move I see is to use my bishop to check the White king:

Player_Black (to Proxy):

I need to analyze this position carefully. 

I see that I'm playing as Black and have several pieces: a king on h8, a rook on c7, a bishop on c1, and pawns on a7, c6, f7, and g6. White has a king on c3 and pawns on b7, c6, and h7.

Key observations:
- My bishop on c1 is very active and controls the long diagonal
- My rook on c7 is attacking White's b7 pawn
- I need to be careful about king safety

The most promising moves appear to be:
1. Capturing the b7 pawn with my rook: c7b7
2. Using my bishop to create threats: c1h6 or c1g5
3. Moving my king to safety: h8g7

After consideration, capturing the pawn with the rook seems most advantageous as it gains material without immediate drawbacks.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Thank you for providing the legal moves. Let me analyze the position and make the best move.

I notice I have a bishop on c1 and a rook on b7, with several options for each. The position appears to be in an endgame phase.

Looking at the moves available, I see a few key considerations:
- My king can move to g7 or h7
- My rook has several options along the 7th rank or can move to b6/b8
- My bishop has long diagonal moves available
- I have several pawn moves

The bishop on c1 is particularly powerful on the long diagonal. Moving it to g5 or f4 would control important squares. However, I should also consider activating my rook on the 7th rank, which is typically strong in endgames.

After analyzing the position, I believe the best move is to activate my rook along the 7th rank, threatening to penetrate White's position.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

After analyzing the position, I see I'm playing as Black with a significant material advantage. I have a rook on e7, a bishop on c1, and my king on h8, while White only has a king on c3 and two pawns.

The most powerful move I see is to use my bishop to deliver a check:

make_move c1h6

This bishop check from c1 to h6 accomplishes several things:
1. It puts White's king in check
2. It controls important squares around White's king
3. It activates my bishop to a more central and powerful position
4. It maintains control of my other pieces and pawns

This move should force White to respond to the check, allowing me to continue developing my attack next turn.

2. Advancing my pawns when safe
3. Using my bishop effectively

The move h6g7 would block my own pawn, which isn't ideal. Moving the bishop to f4, e3, or further would develop it better. The move h6g5 keeps the bishop active on the diagonal.

I'll advance my f-pawn to create more space and potentially open lines for my bishop:

I need to analyze this position carefully. 

I'm playing as Black and have several pieces: a king on h8, pawns on a7, c6, f5, g6, and a bishop on h6. White has a king on e1 and pawns on b7 and h7.

Looking at the legal moves, I need to consider:
1. King safety - my king is currently safe
2. Material - I have a bishop and several pawns, giving me a material advantage
3. Pawn advancement - I could push my pawns toward promotion
4. Bishop mobility - my bishop on h6 has many diagonal options

The most promising moves appear to be:
- Advancing my a-pawn with a7a5 to create a passed pawn
- Moving my bishop to a more active position like h6e3 to control the center
- Advancing my g-pawn with g6g5 to gain space

After consideration, I'll move my bishop to e3, which controls more of the center, puts pressure on White's position, and maintains my material advantage.

I can see the current position. I'm playing as Black and I have a king on h8, a bishop on e5, and pawns on a7, c7, g7, and f6. White has a king on e1, a rook on b8, and a pawn on h7.

Let me check what legal moves I have available.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Proxy (to Player_Black):

h8h7,h8g7

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

I see that I have only two legal moves available as Black:
1. h8h7 - Moving my king from h8 to h7
2. h8g7 - Moving my king from h8 to g7

This is a critical position. My king is confined to the corner with limited mobility. The white rook on b8 is controlling the 8th rank, preventing my king from moving horizontally.

Looking at the position more carefully:
- If I play Kh7, I'll be moving toward the white pawn on h7, which isn't ideal
- If I play Kg7, I'll be moving to a square that's protected by my own pawn, which provides some safety

The move Kg7 (h8g7) appears to be the better option as it keeps my king protected and gives me slightly more mobility for future moves.

Looking at the board:
- I have my king on g7 with a white pawn on h7 nearby
- I have a bishop on e3
- I have pawns on a7, c6, g6, and f5
- White has a king on e1 and a rook on b2

The most pressing issue is the white pawn on h7, which is threatening to promote. I need to address this immediately.

The best move is to capture that pawn with my king:

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Thank you for providing the legal moves. Let me analyze the position and make the best move.

I notice that my king is on g7 (not h7 as I initially thought), and my bishop is on e3. I have pawns on a7, c6, g6, and f5.

Looking at the available moves, I need to consider:
1. Safety of my king
2. Activity of my bishop
3. Pawn advancement

The white rook on b2 isn't immediately threatening anything. My bishop on e3 is well-placed, controlling important diagonals.

I think advancing my f-pawn is a good idea to create a passed pawn and increase my advantage. This will strengthen my position and potentially create promotion threats.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

I see that I have two legal moves available:
- h7g8: Moving my king from h7 to g8
- h7g7: Moving my king from h7 to g7

Looking at the board again, I notice there was an error in my initial assessment. My king is actually on h7 (not g8 as I first stated).

Let me analyze these options:
- Moving to g8 puts me in the corner, which is generally safer in endgames
- Moving to g7 keeps my king more centralized and protects my g7 pawn

Since I have a material advantage (bishop and several pawns vs just a rook), I should aim to advance my pawns while keeping my king safe. Moving to g7 protects my pawn and maintains better king activity.

I'll make my move:

Looking at the legal moves, I notice I have several strong options:
- My bishop on e3 has multiple good moves, including e3g1 which would attack White's rook on h2
- I could advance my pawns

The most immediate threat appears to be the bishop capturing on g1, which would win material by attacking the rook on h2 with no way for White to save it.

- White's rook on f6 is threatening my g6 pawn
- My bishop on e3 is very active and could potentially deliver check
- My king on g7 needs to stay safe

Looking at my options, I notice that my bishop on e3 has several strong moves. Moving it to g1 would deliver check to the white king. This seems like the most forcing and advantageous move.

Thank you for providing the legal moves. Let me analyze the position:

I notice that White's rook is on f8, and one of my legal moves is g7f8, which would capture the rook. This is clearly the best move in the position as I can win a rook for free.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Thank you for providing the legal moves. Now I can make an informed decision.

Looking at the position, I notice that White has advanced their e-pawn to e5, directly confronting my e5 pawn. I also see that White has a knight on a3 and has pushed pawns to f4 and h5.

Among my options, I should prioritize development and control of the center. A few good candidate moves include:

1. Developing my bishop with `f8e7` or `f8d6`
2. Developing my other rook with `a8b8`
3. Moving my knight to a better square like `f6d5` or `c6d4`
4. Advancing a central pawn with `d7d5`

After consideration, I'll develop my bishop to e7, which is a solid developing move that protects my king and prepares for castling.

I notice that I have castled kingside (my king is on g8), and I have a pawn on e5 that could be vulnerable to the white knight on c4. I also see that my dark-squared bishop is on e7 rather than the typical fianchetto position.

One of the strongest moves in this position would be to develop my rook to e8, connecting my rooks and controlling the open e-file. This is a standard positional move that improves my piece coordination.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

After analyzing the position, I can see I'm playing as Black and need to make a move. 

I notice my king is on g8, and I have knights on c6 and f6, bishops on c8 and e7, and a queen on d8. White has a knight on c4 that's attacking my position.

Looking at my options, I should prioritize development and king safety. The knight on f6 has some good options, particularly f6-e4 which would attack the center and put pressure on White's position.

- I have knights on c6 and e4, with the e4 knight attacking White's position
- I have bishops on c8 and e7
- There appears to be some tension in the center and kingside

I need to analyze the position carefully before making my move.

I notice that:
- My king is on g8 with the rook on a8 and f8 square empty, so castling kingside is possible
- White has a knight on b6 attacking my position
- I have a knight on f2 that's deep in White's territory, which appears to be a strong piece
- My bishop on e7 has several possible moves

Looking at the position, castling kingside would be a good priority to improve my king's safety.

After analyzing the position, I see several interesting options. I notice that I have castling available (e8g8), which is often a good move to secure king safety. I also have knights on c6 and f2, with the f2 knight being particularly active and putting pressure on White's position.

Looking at the board, I see that my knight on f2 is attacking White's king on e4, which is quite unusual and suggests a tactical position. Castling kingside would be a standard developing move that improves king safety.

Given the tactical nature of the position with my knight on f2 attacking White's king, I'll castle kingside to secure my king while maintaining the pressure.

After analyzing the position, I see several good options. I notice my king is on g8 and I have a knight on c6, a bishop on e7, and my queen on d8. White has a knight on b6 that's attacking my position.

I'll play a solid developing move by castling kingside, which protects my king and connects my rooks:

I notice I have several good development options. Since White has played Nb5, I should consider how to respond to this threat against my c7 pawn. I also need to continue my development.

One strong move is to develop my knight on c6 to d4, which attacks White's queen on d2 and puts pressure in the center.

Looking at the board, I notice:
- I have a knight on d4 that's quite active
- White has a knight on a4 that's somewhat out of play
- My king is castled kingside (h8) but the rook is still on f8
- White's queen is on d2, which could be targeting my queenside

One of my strongest options is to develop my knight from d4 to f5, which would:
- Attack White's pawn on g7
- Control important central squares
- Potentially prepare for kingside play

4. I have a bishop on e7 that could be developed

Looking at the legal moves, I notice I can castle kingside, which would improve my king safety and connect my rooks. This is typically a strong priority in the middlegame.

- I have a knight on f5 in a good central position
- My bishop on e7 is well-placed
- White has a knight on a4 that's somewhat out of play
- White's queen is on d4, controlling the center

One of the strongest moves I see is developing my bishop on c8 by playing b7-b6 followed by Bc8-b7, which would improve my piece coordination and control of the center.

Among my options, I see that I can castle kingside with g8f8 or queenside with g8e8. Given the position, I think kingside castling is safer and more appropriate since my rook is already on h8 and the kingside pawns provide good protection.

Castling is a priority in the middlegame, and this move would significantly improve my king's position while connecting my rooks.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

After analyzing the position, I can see several key aspects:

1. My king is on g8 with the rook on f8, so castling kingside is not an option anymore
2. White has a knight on a4 that's attacking my c5 square
3. I have a bishop on e7 and a knight on f5 that both have multiple possible moves
4. My pawn structure is mostly intact

Looking at the position strategically, I should focus on developing my pieces and improving my position. The bishop on c8 is undeveloped, and developing it would be a good move.

I'll develop my light-squared bishop:

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Let me analyze the position and make a good move as Black.

I notice several key aspects of the position:
- I have both bishops and a knight developed
- My king is castled kingside
- White has a knight on a4 that could be targeted
- I have a knight on f5 in a strong central position

Looking at my options, I see a few promising moves:

1. Developing my rook with f8e8 would connect my rooks
2. Playing e7c5 would put my bishop on an active diagonal
3. The knight on f5 has several good options including f5d4 which attacks White's center

After consideration, I believe the best move is to develop my bishop to c5, which puts pressure on White's position and improves my piece activity.

1. I have two bishops that are well-positioned (c5 and b7)
2. My knight on f5 is active and threatening
3. White has a queen on d4 that could be targeted

One strong move I see is to develop my bishop from c5 to e3, which attacks White's queen and creates a powerful threat. This forces White to respond to the threat and gives me the initiative.

- My queen can move to various squares

1. I'm playing as Black
2. White has a queen on h5 threatening my kingside
3. I have a knight on f5 and a bishop on g1
4. White has a knight on c3 in the center

Looking at the legal moves, I notice several key options:
- I could castle with g8h8
- I could develop my rook with f8e8
- I have knight moves from f5
- I have bishop moves from g1

Given White's queen on h5 threatening my kingside, I should prioritize king safety. Castling kingside would be a good defensive move here, completing my king's development and connecting my rooks.

1. I have two bishops (on e3 and e4) that are actively placed
2. My knight on f5 is well positioned
3. The white queen is on h5, which could be vulnerable

One particularly strong move I see is `e4f3`, which attacks the white pawn on f2 and threatens the white king's position. This move maintains pressure and develops my attack.

1. I'm playing as Black and my king is on g8
2. White's king is on c2, somewhat exposed
3. I have two bishops on e3 and f3, putting pressure on White's position
4. White has a queen on h6, which could be threatening
5. I have a knight on f4 that appears active

After analyzing the position and available moves, I see several interesting options. 

One of the strongest moves appears to be capturing White's queen with my bishop:
- e3h6 (Bishop takes Queen on h6)

This would be a significant material gain, capturing White's queen for my bishop. Since the queen is worth 9 points and the bishop only 3, this would give me a substantial advantage.

I don't see any immediate threats that would prevent this capture, and gaining such a material advantage would likely be decisive in this position.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

After analyzing the position and available moves, I can see I have several good options. 

I notice my knight on f5 has some strong moves, and I also have opportunities with my bishop on f3. Looking at the position, I see White's king is on c2 with a rook on d4, and I have a bishop on f3 that can attack along the diagonal.

One of the strongest moves appears to be:

make_move f3d1

This bishop move delivers a check to White's king from d1, forcing a response. Since the king is on c2 and the bishop moves to d1, this creates a direct check that White must address immediately. This is a strong tactical opportunity that puts pressure on White's position.

Let me analyze the position and make a strong move as Black.

I notice several key aspects of the position:
- I have a knight on f5 that's well-positioned and could potentially fork pieces
- White has a knight on c3 that's somewhat active
- My king safety is important to consider
- I have a bishop on h8 that could be developed better

Looking at the legal moves, I see several promising options:

1. Knight moves from f5 could be strong, especially if they create threats
2. Pawn advances like e5-e4 could gain space
3. King safety moves like castling (f8g8 or h8g8) would be prudent

After evaluation, I believe castling kingside is a priority to improve my king's safety.

4. My king is on g8 with the rook on h8 still in place

Looking at my options, I notice that my e5 pawn is under attack from White's h4 pawn. I should also consider developing my pieces and improving my king's safety.

One strong move is to advance the e-pawn to e4, which:
- Gains space in the center
- Threatens White's knight on c3
- Supports my knight on f5
- Opens the diagonal for my bishop on h6

- I have a queen on d8, rooks on a8 and h8
- I have a bishop on h6 and a knight on f5

- My king is on h8 with a rook on f8, suggesting I could castle kingside with Kg8
- I have a knight on f5 that's actively placed
- White has a bishop on b7 attacking my a8 rook
- My e4 pawn is advanced and could be vulnerable

Looking at the legal moves, I see several good options:
1. Castle kingside with Kg8 (h8g8)
2. Develop my rook with Re8 (f8e8)
3. Move my knight on f5 to a better square
4. Protect my a8 rook that's under attack

Castling is a priority for king safety, and it connects my rooks. This seems like the best move in this position.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Looking at the position, I need to assess the situation carefully:

1. Material seems roughly equal
2. My king on g8 is somewhat exposed with the knight on f5 providing some protection
3. White has a bishop on b7 that's attacking my rook on a8
4. I have a pawn on e4 that's advanced and potentially strong

Among my options, I notice:
- I could develop my rook with a8c8 or a8b8
- I could move my queen to improve its position
- I could advance some pawns to gain space
- I need to be careful about the bishop on b7 threatening my rook

After evaluation, I think the best move is to connect my rooks and protect the a8 rook from the bishop on b7.

One strong move I see is to develop my queen to f6, which would control important central squares and put pressure on White's position:

The move f5xe4 (capturing White's bishop with my knight) looks strong as it removes a powerful piece and improves my position.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

After analyzing the position, I see that I'm playing as Black with my king on g8, queen on d8, and a knight on g2. White has bishops on h7 and f6, and the white king is on b3.

I notice my knight on g2 is active and could make some interesting moves. Also, I should consider my king's safety since it appears to be somewhat exposed.

One strong move would be to play the knight from g2 to e3, which would attack White's c-pawn while also potentially threatening the king on b3.

I'll analyze the position and make a strategic move as Black.

Looking at the board, I notice:
- I have a knight on e3 that's actively placed in White's territory
- White has two bishops (on h3 and f4) and a rook on h1
- My king is on g8 with some pawn protection
- My queen is on d8

One of the strongest moves I see is to develop my knight on e3 to a more active square. The knight on e3 is well-positioned and can make several good moves. Moving it to g4 would attack White's bishop on f6 (which appears to be on f4 on the board).

I notice several important features of the position:
- White has two bishops (on h3 and f6) and a rook on h1
- My king is on g8 with limited mobility
- I have a knight on g4 that could be active
- White's king is exposed on b4

One of the strongest moves I see is to use my knight to create a threat:

make_move g4e3

This knight move to e3 creates multiple threats:
1. It attacks White's c2 pawn
2. It creates a potential fork threat against White's king and other pieces
3. It moves my knight to a more central and active position

This move should give me good counterplay and put pressure on White's position.

1. My king is on g8 with the rook on f8, so castling is not an option
2. I have a knight on f5 that's quite active
3. My queen on d8 has several possible moves

The knight on f5 is well-positioned and putting pressure on White's position. I should consider if there are any tactical opportunities with it. However, I also need to continue my development.

One strong move is to connect my rooks by moving the queen, which would improve my coordination. The move d8e8 accomplishes this while maintaining control of important squares.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

I need to analyze this position carefully. I'm playing as Black and I notice:

1. Material is roughly even
2. My king is on e8 with a rook on a8 and f8
3. I have a knight on d4 that has several potential moves
4. White has a bishop on h5 that could be threatening my kingside

Looking at my options, I see several strong candidate moves:

1. Knight moves from d4, particularly d4f3 which could attack White's king on a3
2. Castling with e8c8 (queenside) or e8g8 (kingside)
3. Moving my king to safety

The knight on d4 is well-positioned and could create threats. However, ensuring king safety is a priority. Since I can castle kingside (e8g8), that would be a strong move to improve my king's safety.

Wait - I need to double-check. Looking at the legal moves list, I don't see e8g8, but I do see g8h8. This suggests I may have already castled kingside and my king is actually on g8. In that case, I should consider improving my position further.

Based on the legal moves and board position, I'll move my knight to f3, creating a threat against White's king.

- White has a king on b4 with rooks on h4 and e1
- I have a knight on f3 that's quite active
- White has a bishop on h7 that could be threatening

Looking at my options, I see several strong possibilities:
1. My knight on f3 has multiple good moves, including f3d4 which would attack White's king and pawn
2. I could castle kingside with g8h8
3. I could move my king to safety

The knight move to d4 looks particularly strong as it creates a direct threat against White's king.

One strong move would be to develop my knight further with Nd4-f3, which attacks the white rook on h4 and puts pressure on White's position.

Looking at my options, I should prioritize:
1. King safety - I could castle kingside with g8h8
2. Protecting my knight on g5
3. Developing my pieces

The kingside castle (g8h8) looks strong here as it gets my king to safety and connects my rooks. This is a standard priority in the middlegame.

Looking at the legal moves, I see I can castle kingside (f8g8 or h8g8), which would improve my king's safety. The knight on g5 also has tactical possibilities.

Given the exposed position of White's king, I'll castle kingside to improve my king's safety while preparing for an attack.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

After analyzing the position, I can see I'm playing as Black and have several options. 

I notice my king is on e8 with rooks on a8 and f8, and a knight on g5. White has a bishop on h7 that's putting pressure on my position, and White's king is on a3.

Looking at my options, I should prioritize king safety and development. The knight on g5 has good mobility, and I could consider castling kingside.

I'll castle kingside, which is a strong move to improve my king's safety:

Player_Black (to Proxy):

I need to analyze this position carefully. 

I notice that:
- White has a rook on e4 attacking my e-file
- White has a bishop on h7 which is threatening my kingside
- My king is on g8 with limited mobility
- I have a knight on g5 that has several options

Looking at the position, I should address the pressure on my kingside. The bishop on h7 is particularly concerning as it restricts my king's movement.

One strong move would be to capture that bishop with my knight:
g5h7 (Knight from g5 takes the bishop on h7)

Let me make this move:

Player_Black (to Proxy):

I apologize for the error. Let me check the legal moves again and make sure I'm reading the board correctly.

Looking at the board again, I see that what I thought was my knight on g5 and a white bishop on h7 is actually different. Let me re-examine the position and the legal moves.

From the legal moves list, I see I have options like moving my king (h8g8, f8g8), moving my queen on e8, moving my knight on g5, etc.

Let me choose a strong move from the legal moves list:

- I have a knight on e4 that has several potential moves
- My queen is on e8
- White has a bishop on h7 that could be threatening my kingside

One of my strongest options appears to be moving my knight from e4, which is currently active and could potentially fork pieces or create threats.

The move e4f6 looks particularly good as it develops my knight to a strong central square, protects my kingside, and could threaten White's position.

After analyzing the position, I can see that I'm playing as Black and there's a white rook on e5 that's attacking my queen on e8. This is a critical situation that requires immediate attention.

My priority is to address this threat. I have several options:
1. Move my queen away (e8e7, e8e6, etc.)
2. Block the check with a piece
3. Capture the attacking rook

Looking at the position, I notice I have a knight on f6 that can capture the rook on e5. This seems like the best move as it eliminates the immediate threat and gains material.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

I need to analyze this position carefully. 

I notice that:
- White has a rook on d4 threatening my c-pawn
- White has another rook on e1
- I have a knight on f2 that's quite active
- My king is on h8 with potential safety issues

Looking at the legal moves, I see I can move my king to g8, which would be a good defensive move to get out of potential checks from the h-file. This also maintains my castling structure.

I'll make this move:

Looking at my legal moves, I see several critical options:
- I could castle by playing g8h8
- I could move my queen on e8 to safety
- I could develop my knight on f2

The most pressing issue is my king's safety. Castling kingside with g8h8 would be a standard way to improve king safety.

2. My knight on f2 is threatening White's king on a1, potentially setting up a checkmate
3. I need to decide whether to capture the bishop on h6 with my g7 pawn or make a more urgent move

The most critical move appears to be checking White's king with my knight, which could lead to checkmate if White doesn't respond correctly.

2. White has a bishop on h8 threatening my king
3. My king is on e8 with my queen on e5 and rooks on a8 and f8
4. White has rooks on d4 and e1

The most pressing issue is the bishop on h8 which is checking my king. I need to address this check immediately. Looking at my legal moves, I have several king moves available.

The safest option appears to be moving my king to g8, which gets out of check and maintains protection of my f7 pawn.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

I apologize for the error. Let me look more carefully at the board and the legal moves again.

Looking at the board again, I see that my king is actually on g8 (bottom right from Black's perspective), not e8 as I mistakenly thought. The bishop on h8 is actually my bishop (Black's), not White's bishop.

Let me select a proper move from the legal moves list:

I see that I'm playing as Black and the position is quite complex. Looking at the board:
- I have a knight on e3 that's actively placed in White's territory
- My king is on g8 with a rook on f8
- White has a bishop on h8 that's threatening my position

Among my legal moves, I notice I can castle kingside with "f8g8", which would improve my king's safety and connect my rooks. This is typically a strong move when available.

2. I have a knight on e3 that's quite active in White's territory
3. White has a rook on c4 and d1, and a bishop on h8
4. My position seems somewhat exposed

Looking at my options, the knight on e3 has several strong moves. In particular, the knight fork on f1 looks very promising as it would attack White's king on a2 and rook on d1 simultaneously.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

After analyzing the position, I can see I'm playing as Black and I'm in a difficult situation. My king is exposed on e8 with White's rook on d4 delivering check. I need to address this immediate threat.

Looking at the legal moves, I have several options to get out of check:
- Move my king (e8f8, e8d8, e8e7, etc.)
- Block the check with a piece
- Capture the checking piece

The most important factor is my king's safety. Moving to f8 would put me next to my rook, providing some protection. Moving to d8 would block my own rook. Moving to e7 would expose my king further.

I'll choose to move my king to f8, which maintains better king safety and coordination with my rook.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Now I have a clear picture of the position and my available moves. Let me analyze the situation:

I'm playing as Black, and I notice:
- White has a rook on d4 and c4, and a bishop on h8
- I have my king on g8, queen on f8, and a knight on f1
- There's a white rook threatening my queen on d8

The most urgent issue is that my queen on f8 is under attack by the white rook on d8. I need to address this immediately.

Among my options:
- I could move the queen to e8 or d8 (capturing the rook)
- I could move my rook from a8 to d8 (capturing the rook)

Capturing the rook with my queen (f8d8) seems like the best move here as it eliminates the immediate threat and gains material.

One of the strongest moves appears to be developing my knight from f1 to g3, which attacks White's rook on c4. This creates an immediate tactical threat.

- I have my king on g8, queen on d8, and a knight on g3
- The position seems quite open

The knight on g3 is active and potentially threatening White's king on a2. I should consider if there are any immediate tactical opportunities.

One strong move appears to be Qd1+, which would check the White king and potentially lead to material gain or even checkmate.

2. My knight on g3 could deliver some threats
3. I need to ensure my king's safety

One particularly strong move is to use my queen to attack White's king on a1:

Player_Black (to Proxy):

I need to analyze the position carefully before making my move.

Looking at the board, I notice:
- I'm playing as Black with my king on g8
- White has a rook on c3 and a bishop on f4
- White's king is on a2
- I have a knight on g3 which is actively placed
- There's a white pawn on h4 that could be vulnerable

The knight on g3 is well-positioned and has several good options. I could attack White's bishop on f4 with Ne4, or potentially create a fork with Nf5 or Ne2.

Another consideration is developing my rooks, particularly by connecting them with Kf8.

After evaluating the options, I believe the strongest move is to attack White's bishop with my knight.

I'll analyze the position and make a strategic move as Black.

Looking at the board:
- I'm playing as Black with my king on g8
- White has a rook on b2, a bishop on f4, and the king on a1
- I have a knight on e4 which is well-positioned
- The pawn structure shows I have pawns on a7, f7, g7, h7, and h4
- White has pawns on b4, c7

Key considerations:
1. My knight on e4 is active and has several possible moves
2. I should be careful about the white rook on b2 which controls the b-file
3. The white bishop on f4 is targeting my kingside

Among my options, I see that my knight on e4 can move to f2, which would be a fork attacking both White's king on a1 and the rook on b2. This is a winning tactical opportunity.

- White has pawns on b4 and c7 (promoted)

I see that I'm playing as Black and have my king on g8 with rooks on a8 and h8. White has a bishop on f4 threatening my knight on b2, and a rook on b6 that's applying pressure on my position.

Looking at my options:
- I need to be careful about the bishop on f4 threatening my knight on b2
- Moving my knight would be a priority since it's under attack
- I should also consider king safety

The knight on b2 is under attack, so I should move it. The best option appears to be:

make_move b2d3

This moves my knight to d3, getting it out of danger from the bishop while placing it in a more central and active position. From d3, the knight can potentially threaten White's pieces and control important central squares.

3. White has a rook on b8 that's attacking my rook on a8
4. My knight on f4 is well-positioned and has several potential moves

Given the position, I should address the immediate threat to my rook on a8. I can either move the rook or defend it. Moving my king to f8 also looks reasonable to improve king safety.

After consideration, I'll move my king to f8, which gets it away from the back rank and creates more options for my rooks.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

After analyzing the position, I see several key factors:

1. I'm playing as Black and have a knight on f4 that's quite active
2. White has a rook on b2 that could be threatening my position
3. I have castled kingside with my king on g8
4. Material appears roughly equal

The knight on f4 is my most active piece and can make several strong moves. Among my options, I see that Nf4-g6 would protect my h-pawn while also controlling important central squares. This move would improve my knight's position and maintain pressure.

4. White's king is on a1

The most pressing issue is the White rook on g7, which is creating threats against my kingside. I need to address this immediately. Looking at my options:

The best move appears to be to capture the rook on g7 with my h-pawn:

I need to make a strong move. I notice I have two rooks that could be better coordinated. One good option would be to centralize my rook on f8 by moving it to e8, which would control more of the board and potentially prepare for action on the e-file.

Based on the legal moves provided, I'm playing as Black with my king on h8, and I need to make a move with it. Looking at the position, moving my king to g8 seems safest as it maintains protection from my rooks while giving me more mobility.

4. There are several pawns on the board

Looking at my options, I notice I can play a rook move along the e-file or potentially move my king. Since I have an open e-file with my rook, I should use this to my advantage.

The move e8e1+ looks very strong as it gives check to the white king on b1 from a distance. This forces the king to move and could lead to a decisive advantage or even checkmate soon.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Thank you for providing the legal moves. Now I can analyze the position and make a strong move.

Looking at the position, I notice several key factors:
1. I have a rook on e1, which is already on an open file and controlling the first rank
2. White's king is on c3, quite exposed
3. I have another rook on a8 that could be better utilized

One of the strongest principles in chess is to coordinate your rooks and increase their activity. Since my e1 rook is already well-placed, I should focus on improving my a8 rook by bringing it to the e-file to create a battery of rooks, or to another active square.

The move e1e8 would create a powerful rook on the 8th rank, but I'll check if there are any immediate tactical opportunities first.

Given the exposed position of White's king, doubling my rooks on the e-file seems very powerful. This would create significant pressure and potentially lead to checkmate threats.

I'll make the move:

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Looking at the position, I see I'm playing as Black with my king on g8 and rooks on e8 and e1. White's king is on b4, and there are various pawns for both sides.

I notice I have a powerful rook on the e1 square controlling the first rank. This gives me an opportunity to deliver a check to the white king.

I'll play:

make_move e1b1

This move checks the white king from the side. Since the white king is on b4, my rook on b1 delivers a check. This forces the white king to move, likely to either a3, a4, a5, c3, c4, or c5. This is a strong move that takes the initiative and puts pressure on my opponent.

Looking at the position, I see I'm playing as Black with a significant material advantage. I have two rooks (one on e8 and one on c1) against White's king on b4. The position appears to be winning for me.

Let me analyze the best move:

1. I could deliver a checkmate immediately if possible
2. I could improve my rook positions to restrict White's king
3. I could advance my pawns safely

Looking at the board, I notice I can use my rook on c1 to deliver a check by moving it to c4, which would attack the white king on b4.

1. I can capture White's c7 pawn with my rook: c4c7
2. I can attack White's king with my rook: c4b4 (though the king can escape)
3. I can advance my pawns to create passed pawns

The most decisive move appears to be capturing the advanced c7 pawn with my rook, which removes a dangerous passed pawn and gains material.

I'm playing as Black and have two rooks (on c7 and e1), my king on g8, and pawns on a7, f7, and g6. White has a king on a1 and pawns on b4, g7.

The most critical feature is that I have a rook on e1 controlling the first rank, while White's king is on a1. This gives me a potential checkmate opportunity.

The best move is to play the rook to a1, delivering checkmate:

I'll move my rook to e7, which controls more squares, maintains pressure on the 7th rank, and keeps my rook active and safe.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

I need to analyze this position carefully. I'm playing as Black and have several pieces: a king on g7, a rook on e7, and pawns on a7, f7, and g6. White has a king on a1 and a pawn on b7.

Looking at my options:
- My rook on e7 has many possible moves
- My king on g7 can move in several directions
- I have pawn moves available

The most critical factor is that White's b7 pawn is very advanced and threatening to promote. I need to either capture it or stop its promotion.

The best move is to use my rook to capture the b7 pawn:

Thank you for providing the legal moves. Let me analyze the position:

I have several options as Black. Looking at the position:
- White's king is on a2, far away from my pieces
- White has a pawn on b6 which I can capture
- I have a rook on b7 which can capture that pawn

Taking the pawn with my rook seems like the best move since:
1. It wins material
2. It removes White's advanced pawn
3. It keeps my rook active

I'll make this capture:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Thank you for providing the legal moves. Now I can analyze the position and make a strong move.

Looking at this endgame position, I have a significant material advantage with a rook and three pawns versus just White's king. My goal should be to promote one of my pawns while keeping White's king away.

I notice my rook is on b6 (based on the legal moves), and I can use it to control the board and support my pawn advancement. The a7 pawn is the most advanced and has the clearest path to promotion.

I'll advance my a-pawn:

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Now I can see all my legal moves. Since I'm playing as Black with a significant material advantage (I have a rook while White only has a king), I should aim for a quick checkmate.

Looking at the position, I can use my rook to deliver checkmate. The white king is on a2, and I can move my rook to a6, which would put the white king in check with no legal moves.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

After analyzing the position, I see that White has moved their queen to f3 early in the game, which is somewhat aggressive but also exposes the queen.

I'll play a solid developing move that also puts pressure on White's e5 pawn. The knight move Nf6-e4 looks strong here as it:
1. Attacks White's queen on f3
2. Threatens the e5 pawn
3. Places my knight on a strong central square

After analyzing the position and legal moves, I see several good options. The knight on e4 is well-placed but potentially vulnerable. I also notice White's queen is on f3, which could be targeting my kingside.

One strong move is to develop my bishop to e7, which helps protect my king, develops a piece, and prepares for castling. This is a solid developing move that follows good opening principles.

I see that I have the option to castle kingside with e8g8, which would be a strong move in this position. Castling will:

2. Connect my rooks
3. Bring my h8 rook into play

This is particularly important since White's queen is already active on h4, suggesting potential attacking ideas against my kingside.

1. White's queen is on h5, creating pressure on my kingside
2. My king is on g8 with a rook on f8
3. I have a knight on h5 that's under attack by White's queen
4. My bishop on e7 is pinned to my king by White's queen

The most urgent issue is my knight on h5 being attacked by White's queen. I should either move it to safety or defend it. Looking at the legal knight moves (h5g7, h5f6, h5f4, h5g3), I need to choose carefully.

The move h5f6 looks strong - it defends my e5 pawn, develops the knight to a good central square, and escapes the queen's attack. This is a natural developing move that improves my position.

You are a professional chess player and you play as black. Now is your turn to make a move. Before making a move you can pick one of the following actions:
- 'get_current_board' to get the schema and current status of the board
- 'get_legal_moves' to get a UCI formatted list of available moves
- 'make_move <UCI formatted move>' when you are ready to complete your turn (e.g., 'make_move e2e4')

After analyzing the position and my legal moves, I notice several important factors:

1. White's queen on h6 is threatening my kingside
2. My king is on g8 with the h8 square available
3. I have several knight moves available

Given the pressure on my kingside, I should prioritize king safety. Moving my king to h8 gets it away from the g-file and is a solid defensive move.

Thank you for providing the legal moves. Let me analyze the position and make a decision.

The most pressing issue is the white queen on h6 and pawn on g7, which are creating threats against my king. I need to address this situation immediately.

Looking at my options:
- Moving my king with h8g8 would get out of the immediate pin line but might walk into other threats
- I could develop my rook with f8g8 to defend the g7 square
- Knight f6 has several options but needs to be careful about undefending key squares
- The bishop on e7 could move to improve its position

After careful consideration, I believe the best move is to bring my rook to g8 to defend against the threat on g7.

- My king is on g8 with a rook on f8
- White has a pawn on g7 that appears to be threatening my position
- I have knights on c6 and h5, bishops on e7 and c8

Looking at my legal moves, I need to address the immediate threats. The most pressing concern is defending against any potential checkmate threats on the kingside.

One strong move would be to castle queenside with my king, getting it away from the dangerous kingside:

- My king is on g8 with some vulnerability
- I have knights on c6 and h5, bishops on e7 and d8, and rooks on a8 and h8

One of my priorities should be king safety. I see that White's queen on h5 combined with the pawn on g7 creates some pressure. I should also develop my pieces and improve my position.

Among the available moves, I think moving my king to f8 would be a good choice. This gets my king away from the h-file where White's queen is active and connects my rooks.

Looking at the position strategically, I think one of the strongest moves is to develop my bishop to f6, which would control the important diagonal and prepare for potential kingside castling.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Let me analyze the position:

I see that White's queen is on h4, attacking my h7 pawn. My king is on h8, and I have a rook on f8 and a bishop on f6 that could potentially defend against threats.

Looking at the legal moves, I notice I can castle kingside with "h8g8" which would improve my king's safety. This is a good option since my king is currently exposed.

I also see that White has a knight on f3 and a bishop on h3, both pointing toward my kingside. Castling would help me organize my defense.

After careful consideration, I'll castle kingside:

Looking at the board, I notice:
- White's queen is on h4, creating pressure on my kingside
- White's bishop on f4 is attacking my e5 pawn
- My king is on g8 with limited mobility
- I have a knight on c6 and a bishop on f6 that could be developed better

Among my options:
- Castling is not available as my king has likely already moved
- I should consider improving my king safety
- I could develop my pieces to better positions

After evaluating the position, I'll move my king to h8 to get it away from the g-file which could become dangerous if opened.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

I need to analyze the position carefully. 

I see that White has an aggressive setup with the queen on h4 and a knight on e5, creating pressure. My king is on h8, and I need to consider my defensive options.

Looking at the legal moves, I notice that I can castle kingside with "f8g8", which would connect my rooks and improve my king's safety. This is a strong move in this position as it helps consolidate my defense.

Another good option would be to develop my knight with "c6e5", capturing White's knight and removing a key attacking piece.

After consideration, I believe castling is the best move here as it improves my king's safety and connects my rooks, which is a priority in this middlegame position.

After analyzing the position, I notice several important factors:

1. White has a queen on g7 threatening my king
2. My king is in check and I must respond to this threat immediately
3. I have three legal king moves: g8f8, g8e8, or g8g7

Looking at these options:
- g8g7 would capture the white queen but is likely illegal due to the white bishop on f6 protecting that square
- g8e8 moves toward the center but might be exposed to other threats
- g8f8 seems safest as it keeps my king protected by the rook on h8

I'll make my move:

Thank you for providing the legal moves. Let me analyze the key options:

I notice that one of my most critical moves is `c6e5`, which would capture White's knight on e5 with my knight. This looks like a strong move because:

1. It removes White's knight from its central position
2. After capturing, my knight would be protected by my pawn on f7
3. It relieves some pressure on my position

The other major consideration is that White's queen on e5 is threatening my knight on c6. I need to address this threat.

After careful consideration, capturing the knight seems to be the best option.

You are a professional chess player and you play as black. Now is your turn to make a move. Before making a move you can pick one of the following actions:
- 'get_current_board' to get the schema and current status of the board
- 'get_legal_moves' to get a UCI formatted list of available moves
- 'make_move <UCI formatted move>' when you are ready to complete your turn (e.g., 'make_move e2e4')

After analyzing the position, I see several key elements:

1. White has a queen on e5 attacking my bishop on e7
2. My knight on c4 is active and has multiple options
3. White has a bishop on f5 that's also threatening my position

I need to address the immediate threat to my bishop on e7. I could move it to several squares, but I want to maintain its activity while also potentially developing counterplay.

The move e7d6 looks strong as it:
- Moves my bishop to safety
- Maintains control of important central squares
- Prepares potential future development

2. White's queen is on e5, putting pressure on my position
3. I have a knight on c4 that has several active options
4. My dark-squared bishop on d6 is well positioned with multiple attacking options

One particularly strong move I see is to attack White's queen with my bishop:

- White's queen is on e5, attacking my bishop on e5
- White has a bishop on g7 threatening my kingside
- My knight on c4 is active and could potentially fork pieces
- My king is on h8 with some potential safety concerns

One of the strongest moves appears to be developing my bishop with e5f6, which moves it to safety while maintaining control of important diagonals. This also threatens White's pawn on h4.

- I have a queen on d8
- The position looks somewhat open

Looking at my options, I should prioritize king safety and development. One strong move is to castle kingside, which would connect my rooks and improve my king's safety.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

I need to analyze this position carefully. 

Looking at the board, I see that:
- White has a queen on b5 threatening my c5 pawn
- White has a bishop on g7 that's quite active
- My king is on g8 with limited mobility
- My queen on d8 has several options

The most pressing issue is my c5 pawn under attack. I could defend it with b6, but that weakens my queenside pawn structure. Moving the pawn to c4 is an option to avoid immediate capture.

My king safety is also important - I notice I can move to f8 or e8 to get away from the h-file.

After evaluating the options, I'll move my queen to protect the c5 pawn while also developing the piece to a more active square.

After analyzing the position, I see I'm playing as Black with my king on g8. I notice my queen is on b6 with several good options, and I have a pawn on c5 that could be vulnerable.

Looking at the board, I see White's queen is on a4, which could be threatening. My king's position seems relatively safe at the moment, but I should be careful about potential attacks.

Among my options, developing my queen to a better position seems strong. Moving my queen to c6 would control important central squares and put pressure on White's position.

After analyzing the position, I see several key factors:

1. My king is on g8 with the rook on a8 and h8
2. I have a queen on c6 with several attacking options
3. White has a queen on a4 and bishops on f4 and c1

I notice my queen on c6 has several strong options, including potential threats against White's position. One particularly strong move is to attack White's king with:

make_move c6f3

This move:
1. Directly attacks White's king on b2 with a check
2. Forces White to respond to the check
3. Maintains control of important central squares
4. Keeps my queen active and threatening

This check will force White to either move the king, block with a piece, or capture my queen (which seems unlikely given the position).

- I have a queen on h3 that appears to be active
- White has a queen on a4 and a bishop on f4
- White's king is on a2, which seems exposed

Looking at my options, I see my queen on h3 has several potential moves. Since the white king is on a2, I should check if there are any tactical opportunities.

The move h3f1 looks particularly strong as it would attack the white rook on f1 while maintaining pressure on the kingside. This would force White to either move the rook or defend it, giving me the initiative.

I need to address several issues:
1. My king's safety

One of my strongest moves appears to be moving my queen to e1, which creates a powerful battery with my rook on a1, putting pressure on the e-file and potentially threatening White's king on a2.

After analyzing the position, I see several important factors:

1. I'm playing as Black and my king is on g8
2. White has a queen on b7 which is controlling several squares
3. I have my queen on e1 with some active possibilities
4. My king's position needs attention

Looking at my options, I notice my queen on e1 has several strong moves. In particular, I can play:

make_move e1c3

This move attacks White's king on a1 and the pawn on c1 simultaneously, creating a powerful double attack (fork). This forces White to address the immediate checkmate threat, which should give me a significant advantage.

The most critical move appears to be with my queen. I can either create counterplay or address immediate threats.

Looking at the position, I notice my queen on c3 can move to e5, which would attack the knight on e4 while maintaining control of important squares.

Looking at the threats and opportunities, I see that my queen on e5 can attack White's king on a1 with a check. This would be a strong move that forces White to respond to the check.

I apologize for the error. Let me check the legal moves again and make a valid move.

Looking at the position more carefully, I see that White's king is actually on a2, not a1, and there are pieces blocking a direct attack. Let me select a strong move from the legal moves list.

The queen on e5 has many options. A strong move would be to put pressure on White's position while improving my own. I notice I can check White's king with:

I notice my queen on c3 has many options. One strong move would be to attack the white king directly with:

Looking at my legal moves, I notice that my king has several options, and I also have a bishop on c8 and a rook on a8. 

The most pressing concern is the white queen on b7, which is attacking my a7 pawn. I should address this threat. Moving my king doesn't seem urgent as I'm not in check.

I'll protect my a7 pawn by moving my rook to b8, which also develops my rook and creates a threat to White's queen.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

After analyzing the position, I can see I'm playing as Black with my king on g8. I have two rooks (a8 and g8), a bishop on b7, and several pawns. 

Looking at the legal moves, I notice I can improve my position in several ways. The most critical considerations are:
- King safety
- Piece activity
- Pawn structure

I'll move my king to f8, which improves my king's position by moving it away from the h-file and potentially preparing to centralize it. This is a solid move in what appears to be an endgame position.

Now I have a clear picture of the position and my available moves. Let me analyze the situation:

I'm playing as Black and have several interesting options. I notice:
- My king is on h8 with a rook on f8
- I have a bishop on b7 that has good diagonal control
- White has two bishops (c3 and c2) and a rook on a1

Looking at my options, I see some strong moves:
- The bishop on b7 has several powerful diagonal moves available
- I could improve my rook position
- I could advance my c5 pawn

After evaluation, I'll play the bishop move to e4, which puts pressure on the center and potentially targets White's kingside. This is a strong diagonal for my bishop.

I notice that my c-pawn has advanced to c5, and I have several good options. Since White's pieces aren't immediately threatening me, I'll focus on improving my position.

One of the strongest moves here would be to centralize my rook on the e-file, which gives me control of an open file and increases my rook's activity.

Looking at the board, I'm playing as Black with my king on g8 and rooks on e8 and f8. White has a king on b1, a rook on a1, bishops on e4 and c3, and several pawns.

I notice I have the opportunity to castle kingside with either "h8g8" or "f8g8" (which would be O-O in algebraic notation). Castling would be a good move to improve my king's safety.

Among my options, kingside castling with "f8g8" looks best as it connects my rooks and puts my king in a safer position.

Looking at the board:
- I have my king on g8 with rooks on e8 and g8
- White has two bishops (on d4 and c3) and a rook on a1
- Material is roughly even
- My king's position seems relatively safe

The most pressing concern is developing my pieces and improving my position. I notice that my c5 pawn is under attack by White's bishop on d4. I should either defend it or move it forward.

Moving the c5 pawn to c4 looks good as it:
1. Advances a pawn toward promotion
2. Escapes the bishop's attack
3. Controls more central space
4. Could potentially become dangerous later

The most pressing concern is my king's safety. With White's bishop on g7, I need to be careful about potential threats. Moving my king to h8 would be dangerous due to potential checks from that bishop.

One strong move would be to centralize my rook on e8 by moving it down the e-file where it can become more active and potentially target White's pieces or pawns.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

I see all my legal moves now. Let me analyze the position:

I'm playing as Black and have a rook on f8 and e4, with my king on g8. I notice I have a rook on e4 that's attacking White's f4 pawn. White has bishops on d4 and g7.

Looking at the most promising moves:
- I could capture the f4 pawn with my rook: e4f4
- I could move my rook up the e-file to create threats: e4e8, e4e7, etc.
- I could move my king to h8 to get out of potential threats from the g7 bishop

The capture of the f4 pawn seems most immediately beneficial, as I can gain material. Let me make that move.

1. I have two rooks - one on f8 and one on f4
2. My king is on g8 with potential to castle by moving to h8
3. I have a pawn on c4 that could advance

The most immediate threat I see is that White's bishop on d4 is attacking my rook on f4. I should address this.

The strongest move appears to be to move my rook on f4 to capture White's pawn on f6, which simultaneously:
- Removes my rook from the bishop's attack
- Captures a pawn
- Maintains pressure on White's position

I need to analyze this position carefully. As Black, I have two rooks on f6 and f8, my king on h8, and several pawns. White has a king on b1, two bishops on f2 and g2, a rook on a5, and some pawns.

Looking at the legal moves, I notice several strong options:
1. I could play f6f2, capturing White's bishop
2. I could play f8e8 or f8d8 to control the e-file or d-file
3. I could advance my c-pawn with c4c3

The most immediate opportunity is capturing the undefended bishop on f2 with my rook, which gains material and puts pressure on White's position.

The most powerful move appears to be continuing the attack with my rook on f2. Since this rook is already on the 2nd rank threatening White's position, I should maximize its pressure.

I'll make a move with my rook on f2 to attack the white king on b2:

One of my strongest moves would be to use my rook on b2 to attack the first rank, putting pressure on White's king. Since the white king is on a1, I can play:

make_move b2b1

This move delivers a check to the white king and forces a response. White will likely have to move the king or block with the rook, which would allow me to maintain pressure. This is a strong attacking move that takes advantage of my active rook position.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

I need to analyze this position carefully as Black.

Looking at the board:
- I'm playing as Black with my king on h8 and a rook on f8
- White has a king on b1, a rook on a3, a bishop on b7, and some pawns
- Material is roughly equal, but I need to be careful about that bishop on b7

Key considerations:
1. The bishop on b7 is attacking my a8-h1 diagonal
2. My rook on f8 is undefended
3. I should improve my king's safety

Among my legal moves, I see that I can move my king to g8 which would be a good defensive move, getting out of potential checks from the a1-h8 diagonal.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Looking at the position and my legal moves, I need to make a careful decision:

1. My king is on g8 with the rook on f8 - I should consider king safety
2. White has a bishop on b7 and rooks on a3 and a1
3. I have a pawn on c3 that can advance to c2, which looks promising

The pawn on c3 is very advanced and pushing it to c2 would create a strong promotion threat. This is clearly my most active option and would force White to deal with the imminent promotion threat.

- I have my king on g8 and a rook on f8
- White has a bishop on b7, pawns on a4, b4, h4, and a rook on a5
- My pawns are on a7, f7, and h7

The most critical aspects of this position:
1. My king's safety
2. The activity of my rook
3. Potential threats from White's bishop and rook

The bishop on b7 is controlling the a8-h1 diagonal, which limits some of my options. White's rook on a5 is active but not immediately threatening anything critical.

I think the best move is to activate my rook by moving it to the open e-file where it can gain activity and potentially create threats.

- My rook on e8 is undefended
- White's bishop on b7 is threatening the a8-h1 diagonal
- I should be careful about potential checks from White's rook on c3

Given these considerations, I'll move my rook to safety while maintaining control of the e-file.

Looking at the position, I notice my rook on e1 is completely free and can potentially deliver a check or attack White's pieces. The most powerful move appears to be to use my rook to attack White's king on the a-file.

I'll move my rook to a1, which puts White's king in check and threatens to capture it next move if White doesn't respond appropriately.

Let me check my legal moves to make the best decision.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Thank you for providing the legal moves. Let me analyze the position and make the best move:

The position is quite simplified with few pieces left. My priorities are:
1. King safety
2. Pawn advancement when safe
3. Avoiding any potential tactics

Looking at the moves:
- King moves (g8h8, g8f8, g8g7): None seem particularly urgent as there's no immediate threat
- Pawn moves (h7h6, f7f6, a7a6, h7h5, f7f5): Advancing pawns could create passed pawns

The h7h5 move would capture White's h5 pawn, winning material. This is clearly the best move as it gains a pawn for free.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

I need to analyze this position carefully as Black.

Current assessment:
- I'm playing as Black with my king on g8
- Material is roughly equal (White has a bishop and rook, I have three pawns)
- My king is somewhat exposed, so safety is a priority
- White's rook on b3 could be a threat along the 3rd rank

Looking at my legal moves:
- King moves: g8h8, g8f8, g8h7, g8g7
- Pawn moves: f7f6, f7f5, a7a6

The most pressing concern is king safety. Moving to h8 would put my king in the corner which is generally safer. The h7 pawn move would block one escape square, so I'll avoid that.

I'm playing as Black with my king on g8. White has a bishop on b7, a rook on a5, and a king on a1. White also has pawns on a4, b4, and h4. I have pawns on a7, f7, and h5.

Key considerations:
1. My king is currently on the edge (h8), which limits its mobility
2. Moving my king to g7 would put it in check from the bishop on b7
3. I need to keep my king safe while maintaining control of key squares

After evaluating my options, I'll move my king to g8, which gives it more space and avoids any immediate threats.

I need to analyze this position carefully as Black.

Looking at the board:
- My king is on g8
- White has a rook on c3 and a bishop on b7
- White's king is on a1
- There's a potential threat from the bishop on b7 controlling the a8-h1 diagonal

The most urgent concern is my king's safety. The bishop on b7 is controlling the diagonal and could be a threat. I need to ensure my king is safe and potentially improve my position.

Among my options:
- Moving the king (g8h8, g8f8, g8h7, g8g7)
- Moving pawns (f7f6, a7a6, f7f5)

The safest and most solid move appears to be:

make_move g8h8

This moves my king to the corner, away from the center, which is generally safer in endgames. It maintains flexibility for my future moves while staying protected.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

I see the current position and my legal moves. Let me analyze the situation:

1. I'm playing as Black with my king on h8
2. White has a bishop on c8 and a rook on c3
3. White's king is on a1
4. I have pawns on a7, f7, and h4
5. White has pawns on a4, b4, and h4

Looking at my options:
- King moves: h8g8, h8h7, h8g7
- Pawn moves: f7f6, f7f5, a7a6

The white bishop on c8 is currently attacking my king's diagonal, so I need to be careful. Moving my king to g7 would put me in check from the bishop, so that's not viable.

The safest and most active move appears to be:

make_move h8g8

This keeps my king safe while moving it away from the corner, giving me slightly more mobility. The bishop can't attack me on g8, and I maintain protection of my f7 pawn.

Looking at the position critically:
- White's bishop on b7 is controlling the a8-h1 diagonal
- White's rook on c3 could potentially threaten my king if I'm not careful
- I should prioritize king safety and pawn advancement that improves my position

The move f7-f5 would advance my pawn two squares, gaining space and potentially creating counterplay. This is a standard way to seek counterplay in endgames.

- The white rook on c3 could potentially attack along the 3rd rank or c-file
- The white bishop on c8 is currently controlling diagonals but not directly threatening my king
- I should improve my king's position or address any immediate threats

The move g8f7 looks good as it moves my king to a safer square, away from potential checks along the g-file, and gives me more flexibility.

2. White has a rook on c6 and a bishop on c8
3. White has pawns on a4, b4, and h4
4. I have pawns on a7, f5, and h5

I need to prioritize king safety. Moving to g8 seems safest as it gets away from the white rook's influence on the 6th rank and the bishop's diagonal.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

I see the current position and my legal moves. Let me analyze the situation:

I'm playing as Black with my king on g8. White has a bishop on c8, a rook on c3, and pawns on a4, b4, and h4. I have pawns on a7, f5, and h5.

Looking at my options:
- I can move my king to various squares (h8, f8, h7, g7, f7)
- I can advance my a-pawn to a6
- I can advance my f-pawn to f4

The most critical factor is my king's safety. The white bishop on c8 is controlling the h3-c8 diagonal, and the white rook on c3 is controlling the c-file. 

Moving my f-pawn to f4 seems like a good option as it advances my position and doesn't expose my king. This pawn advance could potentially create counterplay.

I'm playing as Black with my king on g8 and pawns on a7, f4, and h4. White has a king on a2, a rook on c3, a bishop on c8, and pawns on a4, b4, and h5.

Key considerations:
1. My king is not in check
2. I need to be careful about potential checks from the white rook or bishop
3. I have pawn moves available

The most active move appears to be advancing my f-pawn with f4-f3, which creates threats and gains space. This pawn is already advanced and continuing its march puts pressure on White.

4. I have pawns on a7, h4, and f3, with the f3 pawn being quite advanced

Looking at my options, I notice my f3 pawn is very advanced and can be pushed to f2, creating a strong promotion threat. This would force White to deal with this immediate threat, giving me a significant advantage.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Thank you for providing the legal moves. Let me analyze the position:

I notice I have a pawn on f2 that can promote immediately - this is a critical opportunity. I also need to consider my king's safety.

Looking at the position:
- My pawn on f2 can promote to any piece
- My king on g8 can move to several squares
- My pawn on a7 can advance or capture

The most powerful move is clearly to promote my f2 pawn to a queen, which will give me a massive material advantage and likely a winning position.

I notice several strong options:
1. I could check the white king with `c4c2`, but that would lose my queen to the rook on c3
2. I could capture the bishop with `c4c8`, gaining material
3. I could move my queen to `c4e2`, creating a discovered check (my queen attacks the white king while also threatening the rook)

The strongest move appears to be `c4e2`, which creates a double attack - checking the king while also threatening the rook on c3. After the king moves, I can capture the rook.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

I'll analyze this position as Black.

This appears to be an endgame position where I have a king on g8 and a queen on e2, with pawns on a7 and h4. White has a king on b2, a rook on c3, a bishop on c8, and pawns on a4, b7, and h5.

My queen is very active on e2, controlling many squares and putting pressure on White's position. I should look for the strongest move, which could be either:
1. A king move to safety
2. A powerful queen move that creates threats
3. Advancing a pawn if advantageous

Looking at the position, I notice my queen on e2 is attacking White's rook on c3 without any protection. I can capture it with Qxc3+, which would give check and win material.

I apologize for the error. Let me check the legal moves again and make a valid move.

Looking at the legal moves list provided, I see that "e2c3" isn't actually listed as a legal move. I must have misinterpreted the board position. Let me select a strong move from the available options.

Since my queen is on e2, I can see several strong options. One powerful move would be to give check to the white king at b2 with my queen.

You are a professional chess player and you play as black. Now is your turn to make a move. Before making a move you can pick one of the following actions:
- 'get_current_board' to get the schema and current status of the board
- 'get_legal_moves' to get a UCI formatted list of available moves
- 'make_move <UCI formatted move>' when you are ready to complete your turn (e.g., 'make_move e2e4')

I'll help you make a move as Black in this chess game. Let's first check the current board position.

I can see the current position. This is an endgame position where I'm playing as Black with my king on g8 and pawns on a7 and h4. White has a king on b2, a rook on c3, a bishop on c8, and pawns on a4, b7, and h5.

Let me check what legal moves I have available.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Now I understand my available moves. Let me analyze the position:

1. My king can move to h8, f8, h7, g7, or f7
2. My pawn on a7 can move to a6
3. I also have a pawn on h4

This is a critical position. White has a material advantage with a rook and bishop. The b7 pawn is dangerous and close to promotion. I need to make the best move to defend.

Looking at the position:
- The white bishop on c8 controls the a6-f1 diagonal
- The white rook on c3 controls the c-file
- White's king on b2 is supporting the rook

My priority is to stop White's b7 pawn from promoting. My king is too far away to help with this, so I need to consider my options carefully.

I'll move my king to f8, which gives me more central control and flexibility while staying safe.

Now I understand the position. As Black, I have the following situation:
- My king is on f8
- I have pawns on a7 and h4
- White has a bishop on c8, pawns on a4, b7, and h5, a rook on a3, and the king on b2

Looking at my legal moves, I need to make a strategic decision. The most important considerations are:
- King safety
- Pawn advancement
- Avoiding any potential checkmates

Since my king is exposed, I should prioritize improving its position. Moving to g7 would be good as it gets away from the bishop on c8 and creates more space.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

I can now see my legal moves as Black. Let me analyze the position:

1. I'm playing as Black with my king on g7
2. White has a bishop on c8, a rook on a5, a king on c2, and pawns on a4, b7, h4
3. I have pawns on a7 and h5

The most critical issue is that White's bishop on c8 is attacking my king's diagonal. I need to address this threat immediately. My options are:

1. Move my king to a safe square
2. Block the bishop's attack
3. Capture the bishop (not possible here)

Looking at my king moves, I should avoid f8, g8, and h8 as they're still on the bishop's diagonal. Moving to f7 or h7 would be safer.

Between f7 and h7, h7 seems better as it keeps my king closer to my h-pawn which might be useful later.

h8h7,h8g7,a7a6

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

I can see I have three legal moves as Black:
1. h8h7 - Moving my king from h8 to h7
2. h8g7 - Moving my king from h8 to g7
3. a7a6 - Moving my pawn from a7 to a6

Let me analyze the position:
- I have my king on h8 and pawns on a7 and h4
- White has a king on c2, a rook on a5, a bishop on e5, and pawns on a4, b7, and h3
- The white bishop on e5 is controlling the a1-h8 diagonal, which means I need to be careful about my king's movement

Looking at my options:
- Moving h8g7 would put my king in check from the bishop on e5, so that's illegal (and shouldn't be in the legal moves list, but I'll avoid it anyway)
- Moving h8h7 keeps my king safe but doesn't improve my position much
- Moving a7a6 advances my pawn and doesn't weaken my position

I'll advance my pawn to create some counterplay and potentially create a passed pawn.

h8h7,h8g7

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

I can see that I'm playing as Black and I'm in a very limited position. My king is on h8 and I only have two legal moves: h8h7 or h8g7.

Looking at the board:
- White has a king on b2, a rook on a5, a bishop on e5, and pawns on b7, a4, and h4
- I (Black) have pawns on a6 and h7, and my king on h8

The position is quite critical. I need to be careful about my king's safety. Let me analyze the two options:

1. h8h7: Moving my king down one square
2. h8g7: Moving my king diagonally to g7

If I move to h7, I stay in the same file but might be more vulnerable to checks from the white rook if it moves to the h-file. 

If I move to g7, I'm moving away from the corner, which generally gives the king more mobility. The white bishop on e5 doesn't directly attack g7, and the white rook can't immediately reach g7 either.

Given these considerations, I'll choose to move my king to g7, which gives it slightly more mobility.

This is a difficult position. My king is somewhat exposed, and White's bishop on e6 is controlling important squares around my king. White's rook on e5 is also threatening along the 5th rank.

Looking at my legal moves, I need to improve my king's safety. Moving to h8 would put me in the corner which could be dangerous. Moving to f8 seems better as it gets me away from the bishop's diagonal.

f8e8,f8g7,f8e7

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

I can see that I'm playing as Black with my king on f8, and I have three legal moves:
- f8e8: Move my king to e8
- f8g7: Move my king to g7
- f8e7: Move my king to e7

Looking at the position, I notice:
- White has a rook on e5 and a bishop on e5
- White's king is on b2
- There's a white knight on b8

The most important factor here is safety. The e7 square is attacked by the bishop on e5, so moving there would be checkmate. The e8 square seems safe, but it restricts my king's mobility.

Moving to g7 appears to be the best option as it:
1. Moves away from the white rook on e5
2. Gives my king more escape squares
3. Keeps my king protected from immediate checks

Player_Black (to Proxy):

I see the position now. As Black, I have my king on g7 and pawns on a7, h4. White has a king on b2, a rook on e5, a knight on b8, a bishop on c8, and pawns on a4 and h4.

Looking at my legal moves, I need to make a careful decision. The most pressing concern is the white rook on e5, which could potentially deliver check if I move carelessly.

Let's analyze the options:
- Moving to h8, g8, or f8 would put my king on the back rank
- Moving to h7 or f7 keeps my king on the 7th rank
- Moving to h6, g6, or f6 moves my king to the 6th rank

The safest move appears to be g7f6, moving my king diagonally to f6. This keeps my king active and away from potential checks from the rook. It also maintains control of the g-file where my pawn might want to advance later.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Now I understand the position. I'm playing as Black with my king on f6. I have a pawn on a6 and another on h7. White has a king on b2, a rook on d3, a knight on b8, a bishop on c8, and pawns on a4 and h4.

Looking at my legal moves, I need to make a decision for my king. Let me analyze:

1. f6g7 - Moving diagonally up-right
2. f6f7 - Moving straight up
3. f6e7 - Moving diagonally up-left
4. f6g6 - Moving to the right
5. f6e5 - Moving diagonally down-left

The white rook on d3 controls the d-file, so I should avoid moving to positions that could lead to checks along that file. The white bishop on c8 controls the a6-f1 diagonal, which affects e6.

Moving to g7 (f6g7) seems safest as it keeps my king away from the white pieces' immediate control and moves toward my pawn on h7, which I might want to advance later.

- White has a rook on a5, a king on b2, a knight on b8, and a bishop on c8
- Black has my king on g7, pawns on a7, h4, and h7
- White's pieces are quite active, especially that bishop on c8 which controls the a6-f3 diagonal

Looking at my legal king moves, I need to make a decision that keeps my king safe and potentially improves my position. Since I'm in a material disadvantage, I should focus on king safety first.

The move g7f7 looks reasonable as it:
1. Keeps my king centralized
2. Moves away from the h-file where White's pawn is advanced
3. Maintains flexibility for future moves

I'll make this move:

Looking at my legal moves, I need to consider the safety of my king. The white rook on d3 is controlling the d-file, so I need to be careful about that. The white bishop on c8 is also a potential threat along the c8-h3 diagonal.

Since my king is currently on f7, I should move to a safer square. Moving to g8 would be a good choice as it gets my king away from the center and into a safer corner position.

- g8f8 (move king left)
- g8h7 (move king diagonally down-right)
- g8g7 (move king down)
- g8f7 (move king diagonally down-left)

Looking at the position, I need to consider safety and activity for my king. The white rook on c3 controls the c-file but doesn't directly attack me. The white bishop on c8 controls the a6-f1 diagonal but doesn't threaten me directly. The white knight on b8 doesn't currently attack any of my potential king squares.

Moving to g7 seems reasonable as it brings my king closer to the center while maintaining safety. This will help me be more active in the endgame.

I see the current position now. As Black, I have my king on g7 with limited mobility. There's a white knight on b8, a white bishop on f6, a white rook on c3, and the white king on b2. The pawn structure shows my pawns on a7 and h7, with White having pawns on a5, h5.

Looking at my legal moves, I need to make a careful decision. The white bishop on f6 is controlling important squares around my king. The white rook on c3 is also a threat on the third rank.

My priority is king safety. Moving to h8 would put me in the corner with limited escape squares. Moving to f8 or f7 would put me closer to the white bishop. Moving to g8 keeps me on the back rank but maintains some flexibility.

I'll choose to move my king to g8, maintaining distance from the white pieces while keeping some mobility.

You are a professional chess player and you play as black. Now is your turn to make a move. Before making a move you can pick one of the following actions:
- 'get_current_board' to get the schema and current status of the board
- 'get_legal_moves' to get a UCI formatted list of available moves

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

I can see the current position now. As Black, I have my king on g8 with very limited options. Let me analyze the position:

- My king can only move to h8, f8, g7, or f7
- I have pawns on a7 and h7 (with an advanced h4 pawn)
- White has a knight on b8, a bishop on f4, a rook on c3, and the king on a2
- White also has pawns on a4 and h4

This is a difficult position for Black. I need to keep my king safe while avoiding any potential checks or threats.

Looking at the position, I notice:
- Moving to h8 would put me in the corner with fewer escape squares
- Moving to f8 could be risky if White's rook can get to the f-file
- Moving to g7 would advance my king toward the center, which is generally good in endgames
- Moving to f7 would also advance my king toward the center and could help me protect my remaining pawns

I'll choose to move my king to f7, which improves my king's centralization and activity.

- White has a king on a2, a knight on b8, a bishop on f5, a rook on c2, and pawns on a4, h4
- Black has a king on f7 and pawns on a6, h6
- My king on f7 has 6 legal moves: f7g8, f7f8, f7e8, f7g7, f7e7, f7f6

Looking at the position, I need to consider safety and activity for my king. The white bishop on f5 controls the e6 and g6 squares, so I need to be careful about those diagonals. The white knight on b8 is not an immediate threat.

I'll move my king to e7, which keeps it centralized and away from the bishop's diagonal. This maintains flexibility while staying safe.

- Black has pawns on a6 and h5, and my king on e7
- I need to be careful about the white bishop on f5 which controls several diagonals

Looking at my options, I need to consider safety first. The move e7f8 would put my king in the corner which could be restrictive. The move e7d6 might expose my king to the bishop's attack. 

The safest and most central move appears to be e7f7, which keeps my king protected and maintains flexibility.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

I can see that I'm playing as Black with my king on f7, and I have six legal moves available. Let me analyze the position:

- White has a knight on b8, a bishop on f6, a rook on h6, and a king on a2
- Black has pawns on a7, h7, and a4
- White has pawns on a5 and h5

The most pressing threat is the bishop on f6 which is checking my king. I need to get out of check immediately. My options are:
- f7g8 (move to the corner)
- f7f8 (move up)
- f7e8 (move diagonally)
- f7g7 (move right)
- f7e7 (move left)
- f7f6 (capture the bishop)

Capturing the bishop with f7f6 seems like the best move as it eliminates the checking piece and gains material. There doesn't appear to be any immediate follow-up threat after this capture.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

I see the current position and my legal moves. As Black, I have my king on f6 with four possible moves: f6g7, f6f7, f6e7, or f6e5.

Looking at the board:
- White has a king on a2, a knight on b8, a bishop on f4, a rook on f3, and pawns on a4 and h4
- Black has the king on f6 and pawns on a6 and h7

I need to evaluate which king move is safest and most advantageous:
- f6g7 moves diagonally toward my h7 pawn, but could be vulnerable to the white bishop
- f6f7 moves up the f-file, away from the white rook on f3
- f6e7 moves diagonally away from both the white rook and bishop
- f6e5 moves toward the white bishop which is dangerous

The safest move appears to be f6e7, moving diagonally away from the white rook on f3 and the bishop on f4, while maintaining control of central squares.

Now let's check what legal moves I have available.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Looking at the position and available moves, I need to make a strategic decision. 

I notice that White has played d4, and I have the opportunity to capture that pawn with either my knight on c6 or my e5 pawn. Taking with the knight would develop tension in the center, while taking with the pawn would open the e-file for potential development.

I also have standard development options like Bf8-e7 or Bf8-d6.

After analyzing the position, I'll capture the d4 pawn with my knight, which puts pressure on White's center and develops my piece to a more active square.

- White has pushed pawns to a3, b3, and developed some pieces

Let me check what legal moves I have available.

Now I have a clear picture of the position and my available moves. 

Looking at the position, I'm playing a variation where I've developed my knight to d4, which is quite active. This knight is currently attacking White's c2 and e2 squares. I should continue with good development while maintaining my central presence.

One of the strongest moves here would be to develop my dark-squared bishop to e7, which helps protect my king and prepares for castling. This is a natural developing move that follows opening principles.

- I have both knights developed (on f6 and d4)
- My king is still in the center
- I have a pawn on e5
- My dark-squared bishop is on e7
- I can castle kingside with "e8g8" (O-O)

Castling kingside would be a strong move here as it brings my king to safety and connects my rooks. This is typically a priority in the opening/early middlegame.

Looking at my options:
- I could move my queen (d8e8)
- I could block with e7d6 (bishop)
- I could capture the bishop with my h-pawn (h7g6)

The most natural response is to move my queen away from the attack. Moving to e8 connects my rooks and keeps my queen active.

I need to analyze the position carefully before making my move.

Looking at the board, I notice:
- White has a queen on d4 and a bishop on g4 attacking my position
- My king is on g8 with some pieces around for protection
- I have knights on e6 and f6 that could be developed
- There's pressure on the e-file

One strong move would be to castle kingside with "h8g8" or "f8g8" to improve my king safety. Another option is to develop my knight with a move like "f6g4" to attack White's queen.

After considering the options, I'll castle kingside:

I need to analyze the position carefully before making my move.

Looking at the board, I notice:
- White has developed their light-squared bishop to g5, putting pressure on my kingside
- White's queen is on e3, adding pressure to the e-file
- My king is on g8 with castling rights intact
- I have knights on e6 and f6, bishops on e7 and c8

Given the position, I should prioritize king safety and development. The most natural move appears to be castling kingside, which would connect my rooks and bring my king to safety.

- White has a queen on d4 and a bishop on h4
- My king is on g8 with rooks on a8 and h8
- I have knights on e6 and f6, bishops on c8 and e7
- The pawn structure is mostly intact

I notice White's queen on d4 is quite active in the center. One good option would be to develop my king's rook by castling kingside with e8f8 (0-0), which would connect my rooks and improve my king's safety.

Another strong option is to develop my light-squared bishop with e7c5, putting pressure on the center and White's kingside.

After consideration, I'll castle kingside to improve my king's safety.

4. I have a bishop on e7 that could be developed

Looking at my legal moves, I should prioritize safety and development. The most pressing issue is addressing White's queen on c7, which is threatening my position.

One strong move is to protect my king by moving my rook from f8 to e8, creating a more secure king position while maintaining control of the e-file.

After analyzing the position, I see that White's queen on c7 is threatening my pawn on b7 and potentially creating other tactical threats. I need to respond to this pressure.

Looking at my legal moves, I notice that my bishop on e6 can capture White's queen with e6c7. This is clearly the best move as it eliminates White's most powerful piece.

I'll play the knight move c7e6, developing my knight to a strong central square where it controls important central squares and defends my pawn on f4. This improves my piece coordination and helps control the center.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

I'll analyze the position as Black:

The position appears to be in the middle game with an interesting tactical situation. I notice:
- My king is on g8 with castling rights still available
- White has a bishop on g5 that's attacking my queen on e7
- I have knights on e6 and f6 that could be developed further
- There's some pressure in the center with pawns on e5 and f4

Looking at my options, I need to address the bishop threat to my queen. I could:
1. Move my queen (to places like d8, f8, d6, c5, etc.)
2. Defend the queen with a move like f6-h5
3. Block with g7-g6

The move e6-c5 looks particularly attractive as it develops my knight to a good square with tempo, attacking White's pawn on f2.

Thank you for providing the legal moves. Let me analyze the position:

I'm playing as Black and I notice several key aspects of the position:
- White has a bishop on g5 that's attacking my queen on e7
- I have knights on f6 and c5 that could be developed further
- My king is still in the center and could benefit from castling

Among my options, I see that castling kingside (e8g8) isn't available, but I can castle queenside (e8c8) which would get my king to safety.

However, I notice that move isn't listed in the legal moves. I can castle with the king moving to d8 (e8d8) though, which would still improve my king safety.

Another strong option is to develop my knight with c5e4, attacking White's pawn on f2.

After consideration, I'll castle to improve my king safety:

Player_Black (to Proxy):

I'll analyze the position and available moves:

The position shows I'm playing as Black with a fairly developed position. White has a bishop on h7 that's attacking my kingside. My knights are active on f6 and c5, and I need to consider both defense and development.

Key observations:
- White's bishop on h7 is threatening my kingside
- I have knights on f6 and c5 in active positions
- My king is on g8 and could use some protection
- My queen is on d8 and can be developed

Among the legal moves, I see several strong options:
- f8e7: Developing the bishop and protecting the king
- f6e4: Moving the knight to an active central square
- c5e4: Another knight move to control the center

After consideration, I'll develop my bishop to e7, which protects my king and helps connect my rooks.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

I'll analyze the position and make a strong move as Black.

Looking at the board:
- White has a bishop on h8 that's attacking my king on g8
- I have knights on f6 and c5, bishops on e7 and e5
- The pawn structure shows I'm playing a Sicilian-type position

Key considerations:
1. My king is under attack from the bishop on h8, so I need to address this
2. I should look for active piece play and development
3. Knight moves like Nf6-e4 could be strong, attacking the center

After evaluating the options, I'll move my king out of the bishop's attack:

I notice that I'm playing as Black and have several good options. My king is on g8, and I have a knight on f6 that can make several moves. I also have a knight on c5 with multiple options.

Looking at the position, I see that White has a bishop on h7 that's threatening my kingside. I should prioritize king safety and development.

One of the strongest moves here is to develop my rook to e8, connecting my rooks and controlling the e-file:

- My knights are active, especially the one on c5
- White has a bishop on h7 that could be threatening
- I have some pawn moves available

Castling kingside seems like a strong priority to get my king to safety, especially since the kingside castle is still available and my king is in the center.

2. I have a knight on f6 that can make several moves
3. I have another knight on c5 with multiple options
4. My queen on d8 has several possible moves

Looking at the position strategically, I see that my knight on c5 can move to e4, which would:
- Attack the central pawn on f5
- Establish a strong knight outpost in the center
- Potentially prepare for future tactics

This looks like a strong developing move that improves my position.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

I need to analyze the position carefully before making my move.

Looking at the board, I notice:
- My king is on g8 without castling rights
- White has a bishop on h7 that's checking my king
- I have a knight on f6 that can capture that bishop
- There's also a knight on f2 that could be developed

The most urgent issue is addressing the check. I have two main options:
1. Move my king (g8f8 or g8e8)
2. Block with a piece
3. Capture the checking piece with my knight (f6h7)

However, I don't see f6h7 in the legal moves list, which suggests the bishop on h7 might actually be on h8 or g7 (the ASCII representation can be a bit unclear).

Given the legal moves available, I'll move my king to f8 to get out of check.

2. Threatens White's bishop on g5

After analyzing the position and my legal moves, I notice several key factors:

1. I have two knights - one on f6 and one on e4
2. White has a bishop on g4 that's attacking my e-pawn
3. My king's position seems relatively safe
4. I have development opportunities for my pieces

The knight on e4 is particularly strong, occupying a central outpost. I should consider moves that maintain or improve my position.

One strong move is to develop my bishop from e7 to d6, which:
- Develops the bishop to a more active square
- Protects the e-pawn indirectly
- Opens up the e-file for potential rook activity

I'll make this move:

I notice my knight on e4 is attacking White's bishop on g3, and I also have a knight on f6 with multiple potential moves. My dark-squared bishop on d6 is well-positioned on the long diagonal.

One strong move would be to capture the white bishop with my knight:

After analyzing the position and my available moves, I'll make a decision.

The position appears to be in the middle game with some pieces already exchanged. I notice my king is on h8 without castling, and I have a knight on g3 that's quite active in White's territory. There's also a pawn tension on the e5-f6 square.

Looking at my options, the knight on g3 is particularly well-placed and could make some strong moves. I can either attack White's bishop on h1 or make a fork with Nf1, potentially threatening White's rook and king.

After analyzing the position, I see I'm playing as Black in what appears to be a middle game position. I have my king on g8 with a somewhat exposed position, and there's a white pawn on f5 that's creating some tension.

Looking at my options, I should address a few priorities:
1. King safety
2. Development and piece coordination
3. Central control

One strong move stands out: I can play the knight from f6 to e4, attacking the center and potentially creating threats. This knight will be well-positioned on e4, putting pressure on White's position.

- White has a bishop on h3 and g1, knights on e5 and b1, and rooks on c1 and h1
- I have a knight on e4 that's quite active
- There's a pawn on f5 that's advanced
- My king is on g8 with a rook on f8 that could castle

One of my strongest options is to develop my knight on e4 to a more active square. The knight on e4 is currently attacking White's e5 knight, but it could be more active on f6 where it would protect my king and control important central squares.

Looking at my options, I should prioritize king safety and piece development. The knight on f6 has several good options, including g4 which attacks White's pawn on f2.

I also notice my e5 pawn is under potential pressure, so advancing it to e4 could be a good way to gain space and challenge White's center.

After considering the available moves, I'll advance my e-pawn:

Looking at the position, I see White has some activity on the kingside with the bishop on h3 and a pawn on f5. I should prioritize king safety and piece coordination.

I'll move my king to the corner, which is a standard safety move in many middlegame positions.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

I'll analyze the position as Black:

The position appears to be in the middle game with an interesting structure. I notice:
- White has a bishop pair (on h3 and h7)
- My king is on h8 with a rook on f8 that could castle
- I have a knight on f6 and bishops on d6 and c8
- There's a pawn on e4 that could advance

Looking at the legal moves, I see several strong options:

1. Castling with `f8g8` would improve my king safety
2. Advancing the e4 pawn with `e4e3` could increase pressure in the center
3. Knight moves like `f6g4` could increase pressure on White's position

After consideration, I believe castling is the priority to secure my king's safety before continuing with other plans.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

After analyzing the position, I see several good options as Black. 

I notice my king is on h8, and I have the opportunity to improve my king's safety by castling artificially with "h8g8" (moving my king from h8 to g8). This would connect my rooks and improve my king's position.

Another strong option is developing my knight with "f6g4", which would attack White's bishop on h2 while also putting pressure on e5.

I also see that my e-pawn can advance with "e4e3", which would gain space in the center and potentially threaten White's position.

After evaluating these options, I believe the best move is to improve my king's safety:

The position looks complex with several tactical elements. I notice:
- My king is on g8 with a rook on f8
- I have a bishop on e5 that's quite active
- There's another bishop on e3
- White has a pawn on f5 that's advanced
- White's king is on g2, somewhat exposed

Looking at my options, the bishop on e5 is particularly strong and has many possible moves. I could also consider developing my rook on a8 or making a kingside move.

After evaluating the position, I think the best move is to activate my bishop on e5 by moving it to f4, which puts pressure on White's position and maintains my piece activity.

Looking at the board, I notice:
- I have a bishop on f4 that's actively placed and attacking White's position
- My knight on f6 is developed
- White has a pawn on f5, which is somewhat advanced
- I need to consider king safety and piece development

Among my options, I see several strong candidates:
- Castling with g8h8 would improve my king safety
- Moving the bishop on f4 to control important diagonals
- Developing my queenside with moves like a8b8

After consideration, I believe castling is the most urgent priority to ensure king safety before continuing with other plans.

- 'get_legal_moves' to get a UCI formatted list of available moves
- 'make_move <UCI formatted move>' when you are ready to complete your turn (e.g., 'make_move e2e4')

After analyzing the position, I see several key features:
- I have a bishop on f4 that's attacking White's position
- I have a bishop on e3 that's threatening White's queenside
- My knight on f6 is well-positioned
- White has a pawn on f5 that's somewhat advanced

One of my strongest moves is to capture White's bishop on d4 with my bishop from f4. This would eliminate an important piece and improve my position.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

After analyzing the position, I see several good options as Black. 

I notice that my king is on h8, and I have the opportunity to castle queenside with "f8g8" which would improve my king's safety and connect my rooks. This is a strong move in the current position.

I also see that my bishop on d6 has several active options, and my knight on f6 can make some interesting moves.

Given the overall position, I believe castling is my priority to improve king safety and rook coordination.

3. I have two bishops (on d6 and e3) and a knight on f6 that could be developed
4. There's a pawn on e3 that could be advanced

One of my strongest moves appears to be advancing my e-pawn with e3e2, which threatens White's back rank and creates immediate pressure. This pawn is already advanced and continuing its march creates concrete threats.

- White has a rook on f4 that's quite active
- I have a bishop on d6 that has good diagonals

The most powerful move available is clearly the pawn promotion on e2. This will give me a significant material advantage.

The move Qf1-h3# appears to be checkmate! The White king on g3 would be attacked by my queen with no legal escape squares.

I can see the board position now. I notice that I'm playing as Black and there's an interesting position with multiple pieces in play. I see that I have a queen on g2, which is quite advanced, and there appears to be some pressure on White's position. Let me check what legal moves I have available.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

After analyzing the position and my available moves, I notice several key factors:

1. My queen on g2 is very active and threatening White's position
2. I have a knight on f6 and bishops on d6 and c8
3. White has a rook on f4 that could be vulnerable

One of my strongest moves appears to be capturing the rook on f4 with my queen:

Player_Black (to Proxy):

I apologize for the error. Let me check the legal moves again and make a valid move.

Looking at the list of legal moves I received earlier, I see that g2f4 wasn't actually listed as legal. Let me select a strong move from the available options.

The queen on g2 has several good options. I can maintain pressure on White's position by moving:

After analyzing the position, I see several key factors:

1. My king is on g8 with the rook on a8 and h8, so I still have castling options
2. White has a rook on f4 that's quite active
3. I have a bishop pair (d6 and c8) which is a strategic advantage
4. My knight on f6 is well-positioned

Looking at my options, I notice I can develop my queenside by moving my rook to b8, which would connect my rooks and prepare for action on the b-file. This is a solid developing move that improves my position.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

After analyzing the position, I can see I'm playing as Black and need to make a move. 

The position shows White has advanced a rook to f4, and I have my king on g8 with a somewhat exposed position. My pieces are reasonably developed with bishops on d6 and e7, a knight on f6, and my queen on d8.

Looking at my options, I should prioritize king safety and piece coordination. The move g8f8 (Kf8) looks sensible as it moves my king away from the g-file where White might build an attack. This also connects my rooks.

Looking at my options, I want to improve my position while ensuring king safety. The move Nf6-e4 stands out as particularly strong - it attacks the white rook on f4 while placing my knight on an excellent central square.

Looking at the board, I see that:
- I'm playing as Black
- White has a rook on f4 that's attacking my knight on e4
- My knight on e4 is currently under attack and needs attention
- I have two bishops (on d6 and f8), a queen, two rooks, and a knight

The knight on e4 is under immediate threat, but it's also in a strong central position. I have several options:

1. Move the knight away to a safe square like c3, c5, f6, or g3
2. Capture something with the knight
3. Defend the knight

Among the knight moves, Nf6 looks particularly strong as it attacks White's rook on f4 while moving to safety.

I notice my king is on g8 with a rook on f8, suggesting I haven't castled yet. There's a white rook on f4 that could be threatening my position. I also have knights on f6, bishops on d6 and c8, and my queen on d8.

One strong move would be to develop my queen to e7, connecting my rooks and preparing to castle. This improves my king safety while maintaining flexibility.

2. Places the queen centrally with good control
3. Attacks the white bishop on g4
4. Maintains pressure on the position

Player_Black (to Proxy):

After analyzing the position and my available moves, I notice several key factors:

1. I have a queen on e4 that's very active and threatening White's position
2. My knight on f6 is well-placed and can make several useful moves
3. White's rook on f4 is undefended and can be captured

The most immediate opportunity is to capture the undefended rook on f4 with my queen:

One of the strongest moves here appears to be moving my queen to e4, which maintains pressure while potentially threatening pieces or creating tactical opportunities.

I notice my queen on f3 has many potential moves, including some that could increase pressure on White's position. Looking at the board, I see that White's king is on e1 and appears somewhat exposed.

One particularly strong move would be to play Qf3-e2+, which would check the White king and potentially force it to move to an awkward square or require White to block with a piece.

After analyzing the position, I can see I'm playing as Black and have several options. The position looks somewhat complex with both sides having developed pieces.

I notice that my king is on h8, and I have a rook on f8 that could potentially be developed. My knight on f6 is well-placed and has multiple options. I also have a bishop on d6 with several diagonal moves available.

Looking at the overall position, I think developing my rook would be a good idea. Moving the f8 rook to e8 would centralize it and potentially prepare for action on the e-file.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

After analyzing the position and my legal moves, I can see I have several good options. I notice I have the opportunity to castle kingside, which would improve my king's safety and connect my rooks.

Castling kingside with "e8g8" (O-O) is a strong move here as it:
1. Brings my king to safety
2. Connects my rooks
3. Activates my h8 rook toward the center

This is a standard priority in chess development, and since the kingside castling lane is clear, I'll take advantage of it.

Looking at the board, I notice:
- I'm playing as Black with my king on g8
- White has advanced pawns on f4 and g4
- I have knights on f6 and bishops on b8 and d6
- The position appears to be in the middle game

Among my options:
- Knight moves from f6 could develop pressure on the center
- Bishop on d6 has several good diagonal options
- I could also consider king safety moves

The move Bd6-f8 looks strong as it protects my king while maintaining the bishop's activity. This bishop is currently on a good diagonal but moving it to f8 improves my king's safety.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

After analyzing the position, I can see that I'm playing as Black and need to make a move. 

I notice several key aspects of the position:
- My king is on g8 with a standard kingside castle structure
- White has advanced pawns on f5 and g5, creating some space on the kingside
- I have a knight on f6 that has several potential moves
- My dark-squared bishop on f8 can move to several squares

Looking at my options, I think developing my dark-squared bishop is a good idea. Moving it to e7 would be solid, connecting my rooks and preparing for potential central play.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

I'll analyze the position and make a strategic move as Black.

Looking at the board:
- I'm playing as Black with my king on g8
- White has advanced pawns on f6 and g6, creating some pressure
- I have a knight on f6 that's under attack by White's pawn on f6
- I have bishops on e7 and b8
- Material appears roughly equal

Key considerations:
1. My knight on f6 is under attack and needs to move
2. I should improve my king's safety
3. I should develop my pieces and improve my position

Among my legal moves, I'll move my knight from f6 to e8, which protects my king and gets the knight out of danger from the f6 pawn.

I can see all my legal moves now. Let me analyze the position:

I'm playing as Black and I notice:
- My king is on g8 with a rook on h8
- I have a bishop on e7 that appears to be well-positioned
- White has advanced pawns on f4 and g4
- White's king is on f2

Looking at my options, I should consider my king's safety and piece development. The bishop on e7 has several good options, including developing to f6 which would control important central squares.

After consideration, I'll move my bishop from e7 to f6, which develops the piece to an active square, controls central squares, and maintains good king safety.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

I need to analyze the position carefully before making my move.

Looking at the board, I notice:
- I'm playing as Black with my king on e8
- White has a king on f2, knights on b4 and d4, and a bishop on h5
- The position seems to be in the middlegame with some pieces already exchanged
- I have both bishops (c8 and f6) and both rooks (a8 and g8)

Among my legal moves, I should prioritize king safety and piece development. The knight on e5 seems to be a strong piece, and I should consider how to improve my position.

After evaluating the options, I'll make a move with my king to improve its safety.

I can now see all my legal moves. Let me analyze the position:

I'm playing as Black and have a relatively solid position. I notice:
- My king is on e8 with castling still possible (both kingside and queenside)
- I have two bishops (f6 and c8) and two knights (e6 and b8)
- White has a bishop on h5 that could be threatening my kingside

Looking at my options, castling kingside would be a good priority to improve my king's safety. This is a standard developing move that would connect my rooks and bring my king to safety.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

I apologize for the error. It seems I misinterpreted the board position. Let me look at the board again more carefully.

Looking at the board, I can see that my king is actually already on g8 (the bottom right corner from my perspective as Black). I also notice that I have rooks on b8 and f8, knights on e6 and b8, and bishops on c8 and f6.

Let me choose a better move from the legal moves list. Since my king is already castled, I should focus on improving my piece coordination or addressing threats.

From the legal moves, I'll develop my bishop from c8:

I apologize for the confusion. Let me be more careful with reading the board and the legal moves list.

I see that my king is actually on e8 (not g8 as I incorrectly stated), and I have the option to castle kingside with e8g8. This would be a good move to improve my king's safety.
