First draft your thinking process (inner monologue): I'm not sure if this is the right time to generate a response. I'll need to check if the user's asking about something that can be answered with a simple yes or no, and then I'll try to make it as casual and as long as you want until you are confident to generate a final answer. Here, format your thoughts or/and draft:

1. The problem is about a math problem involving a number of steps or/and equations.
2. Use LaTeX for any mathematical expressions, like $\sqrt{3x+1} = 5$ and $x = 4$, then the user should think: "Let's see what the user wants to know, and how you can approach this in a way that makes sense. Consider the following problem:

- 'get_current_board' to get the schema and current status of the board
- 'get_legal_moves' to get a UCI formatted list of available moves
