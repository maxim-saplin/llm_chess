Proxy (to Player_Black):

You are a professional chess player and you play as black. Now is your turn to make a move. Before making a move you can pick one of the following actions:
- 'get_current_board' to get the schema and current status of the board
- 'get_legal_moves' to get a UCI formatted list of available moves
- 'make_move <UCI formatted move>' when you are ready to complete your turn (e.g., 'make_move e2e4')

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

We are playing as Black. We need to make a move.
 However, we are not given the current board state or the list of legal moves.
 Therefore, we must first get the current board state or the legal moves.

 Since the problem says: "Now is your turn to make a move", but doesn't specify the position,
 we cannot know what moves are available without querying.

 We have two options: 
   Option 1: Use 'get_current_board' to see the entire board and then figure out legal moves.
   Option 2: Use 'get_legal_moves' to directly get the list of legal moves in UCI.

 Since we only need to know the legal moves to choose one, and we don't need the full board for analysis (as we are an AI and can use the legal moves directly),
 it is more efficient to get the legal moves.

 But note: the problem says we are a professional chess player. However, without the board state we cannot proceed.

 So let's issue the command to get legal moves first.

 However, note that the instructions say: "Before making a move you can pick one of the following actions"

 We are going to pick: 'get_legal_moves'

 Let me write that as the response.

get_legal_moves
