There were occasional timeout errors, treating as model failure mode as the model didn't return the response within a reasonable ammount of time. Even increasing thre timeout from standard 10 minutes to 20 minutes didn't elliminate the issue. Hence the results in his logs are favourable for o3 as it was tested under extended non default timeout:

```
TimeoutError: OpenAI API call timed out. This could be due to congestion or too small a timeout value. The timeout can be specified by setting the 'timeout' value (in seconds) in the llm_config (if you are using agents) or the OpenAIWrapper constructor (if you are using the OpenAIWrapper directly).
