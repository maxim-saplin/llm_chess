Now I can see all my legal moves. As Black responding to White's b2-b3, I'll play a standard opening move.

The move e7-e5 is a strong classical response that stakes a claim in the center. This is a fundamental principle of chess openings - controlling the center with pawns. This move also opens lines for my bishop and queen to develop.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

After analyzing the position, I have several good options. Since White has played b4, I can consider a few strategic responses:

1. I could develop my knight to f6 (g8f6), which is a solid classical move
2. I could counter in the center with d5 (d7d5)
3. I could attack White's b4 pawn with a5 (a7a5)

The move b4 by White is somewhat unusual and not particularly threatening. It aims to control c5 but weakens the kingside. I'll play a principled developing move that also prepares for castling.

I'm playing as Black and it appears to be an early middlegame position. White has developed some pieces and has pawns on b4, c4, d4, f3, e2, g2, and h2. I need to continue my development and ensure my king's safety.

Looking at my options:
- I could castle kingside with g8h8
- I could develop my light-squared bishop with e7d6, e7c5, or e7b4
- I could move my knights to various squares
- I could push pawns to create space or prepare future development

Given the position, I think castling is a priority for king safety, especially since my opponent has developed pieces that could target the center.

I'll analyze the position as Black:

The position appears to be in the early middlegame. White has developed some pieces and castled kingside. As Black, I need to continue development and consider castling for king safety.

Looking at my options:
- I can castle kingside with either h8g8 or f8g8
- I have several knight moves available
- My dark-squared bishop on e7 can move
- I can advance various pawns

Given that my king is still in the center and White has castled, castling kingside would be a priority for safety. The move f8g8 (O-O) would complete my kingside castling.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

I'll analyze the position and make a strategic move as Black.

Looking at the board:
- I have both knights developed (c6 and f6)
- My dark-squared bishop is on e7
- My light-squared bishop is on e5
- White has a queen on b3 that could be threatening my queenside
- I should continue development and consider castling for king safety

Among my legal moves, I notice I can castle kingside with g8f8 or queenside with g8e8. Castling is usually a priority to secure king safety.

I'll castle kingside to protect my king:

After analyzing the position and my available legal moves, I'll make my decision.

The position shows I'm playing as Black with a fairly standard development. I notice White has a queen on c2 and bishops on d4 and f1. My knights are on c6 and f6, and I have bishops on c8 and e7.

Looking at my options, I should continue development while maintaining a solid position. One good move would be to castle kingside, which would bring my king to safety and connect my rooks.

Looking at the legal moves, I should prioritize development and king safety. The e5 pawn is under attack by White's queen, so I should consider defending it or making a counter-threat.

One strong move would be to develop my bishop with e7d6, which defends the e5 pawn and improves my piece activity. This also maintains flexibility for future development.

Looking at the legal moves, I have several options:
- I could defend the e5 pawn with moves like Nf6-d5 or Nf6-g4
- I could move the e5 pawn forward with e5-e4
- I could develop pieces or improve my position elsewhere

The move Nf6-d5 looks particularly strong as it defends the e5 pawn while putting pressure on White's central pawns. This knight would be well-placed in the center and would control important squares.

5. White has a pawn on c3 that could be attacked

One of the strongest moves appears to be Nd4-e2+, which would fork White's king and queen. This would force the king to move and allow me to capture the queen next move.

You are a professional chess player and you play as black. Now is your turn to make a move. Before making a move you can pick one of the following actions:
- 'get_current_board' to get the schema and current status of the board
- 'get_legal_moves' to get a UCI formatted list of available moves
- 'make_move <UCI formatted move>' when you are ready to complete your turn (e.g., 'make_move e2e4')

I can see the current position. Let me analyze what's happening:

1. I'm playing as Black and my king is on g8
2. White's queen is on d4, attacking my bishop on d8
3. I have knights on c6 and f4
4. My bishops are on c8 and e7
5. White has a bishop on c3 and e1
6. There's a pawn tension with White's pawns on c3 and e4

Let me check my legal moves to make the best decision.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

After analyzing the position and my legal moves, I see several key considerations:

1. My bishop on d8 is under attack by White's queen on d4
2. My knight on f4 is quite active and could potentially fork White's king and rook with Ng2+
3. I need to ensure my king's safety

The most promising move I see is the knight fork:

Player_Black (to Proxy):

After analyzing the position, I see several key factors:

1. My king is on g8 and appears to be somewhat exposed
2. I have a knight on g2 that's actively positioned in White's territory
3. I have a bishop on d6 that controls the a3-f8 diagonal
4. My knight on c6 is well-placed and can potentially attack White's queen on d4

Looking at my options, I think the knight on g2 is particularly strong and should be maintained. For my king's safety, I should consider connecting my rooks.

The move g8f8 allows me to connect my rooks and improve my king's position. This is a solid developing move that enhances my king safety.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

I need to analyze the position carefully before making my move.

Looking at the board, I notice:
- White has developed both bishops and the queen
- White has a pawn on c3 and e4, controlling the center
- My king is on h8 without castling
- I have a knight on g2 that's quite active and potentially threatening White's position

One of my strongest pieces is the knight on g2, which is putting pressure on White's position. I should consider how to maximize its impact or protect it if needed.

I also need to continue my development and ensure my king's safety.

After evaluating the options, I'll make a move with my knight on g2:

1. My king is on h8 with a rook on f8 - I could castle queenside with Kg8
2. I have knights on c6 and e3, with the e3 knight being particularly active
3. White has a queen on d4 and bishops on b5 and c3

The knight on e3 is very strong, forking White's f1 bishop and potentially threatening the queen if it moves. I should consider keeping this piece active.

I'll make a move that improves my position while maintaining the pressure from the e3 knight.

I'll play the knight from c6 to d4, attacking the white queen while developing my position.

After analyzing the position, I see I have several good options. I notice I have two knights on c4 and d4 that are quite active, and my queen on d7 has many possible moves.

Looking at the position, I see that my knight on d4 can attack White's bishop on c2 with a fork. This would be a strong tactical move.

One strong move is to develop my knight to e5 with c4e5, which would control key central squares and put pressure on White's position. This knight would be well-placed in the center, attacking f3 and potentially d3.

I can see that I'm playing as Black and my king is in the corner at h8. Looking at the position, I only have two legal moves for my king: h8g8 or h8g7.

The position appears to be quite difficult for Black. I notice that White has a bishop on g7 attacking my king, and I need to move out of check. Moving to g8 would place me on the same rank, while g7 would move me diagonally.

After analyzing the position, I'll move my king to g8, which keeps me protected by my rook on f8.

Looking at the position more carefully, I see that my knight on c2 is quite active and threatening White's position. I should consider whether to maintain this knight or use it for a tactical opportunity.

One strong move I see is to develop my queen to a more active position with:

After analyzing the position, I see several strong options. I notice my queen on e6 has many potential moves, and I have knights on e5 and c2 that could be developed further.

Looking at the position, I see that my knight on e5 is attacking White's knight on f3, which is defending the king on g1. I also notice my queen on e6 has potential attacking opportunities.

One of the strongest moves appears to be moving my knight from c2 to e3, which creates a fork attacking White's king and rook simultaneously.

After analyzing the position, I see I have several strong pieces actively placed - two knights at e5 and e3, a bishop at d6, and my queen at e6. I notice my king is on g7 and seems relatively safe.

One of the most principled moves here would be to activate my rook on f8, which is currently blocked by my own pieces. Moving it to an open file would increase my piece activity.

I'll make a move with my queen to increase pressure and create threats. The move e6f5 looks strong as it attacks White's position while maintaining queen mobility.

This move threatens the g2 square (which could lead to checkmate threats) and maintains control of key central squares. It also keeps my queen active and threatening, while being safe from immediate capture.

After analyzing the position and available moves, I notice I have an active position with my queen on d4 and knights on e3 and e5. 

I see a strong move with my queen that can create immediate threats. I'll play:

make_move d4e4

This move puts pressure on the e-file, threatens the white king on e1, and maintains control of the center. It also keeps my queen active and flexible, able to shift to other files if needed.

1. Attacks the h1 corner
2. Puts pressure on the g-file toward White's king
3. Maintains control of the center

You are a professional chess player and you play as black. Now is your turn to make a move. Before making a move you can pick one of the following actions:
- 'get_current_board' to get the schema and current status of the board
- 'get_legal_moves' to get a UCI formatted list of available moves
- 'make_move <UCI formatted move>' when you are ready to complete your turn (e.g., 'make_move e2e4')

Looking at the position, I see that my knight on e5 can attack White's king on e3 with a fork. This would be a powerful tactical move.

I notice I have a knight on f3 that's quite active, and I should consider my king safety as well as potential attacking opportunities.

Looking at the position, I see that my knight on f3 has several good options. One particularly strong move is to play Nf3-d4, which centralizes the knight, attacks the c2 pawn, and puts pressure on White's position.

3. I have a rook on a8 that could be developed

The bishop on e5 is particularly active and controls important diagonals. I should consider my best development options.

The move c8b7 looks strong as it:
- Develops my light-squared bishop to a good diagonal
- Maintains control of key squares
- Connects my rooks indirectly

I notice my bishop on e5 is attacking White's rook on f6. This is a great opportunity to capture a valuable piece.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

After analyzing the position, I see that I'm playing as Black with my king on g7. White has a rook on f6 that could be threatening, and I need to make a good move.

Looking at my options, I notice I have two bishops (on b7 and f6) and two rooks (on a8 and g8). My pawn structure is somewhat compromised with White's pawns on a4 and b4.

One strong move would be to activate my bishop on b7 by moving it to the long diagonal where it can exert pressure. The move b7-e4 looks particularly strong as it attacks the center and puts pressure on White's position.

3. My king is on g7 with limited mobility

One of my strongest pieces is the bishop on e4, which has many available moves. I can use it to create threats or improve its position.

Looking at the position, I see a good opportunity to put pressure on White's king on d3 while simultaneously protecting my f6-bishop:

Looking at my options, I see a strong tactical opportunity with my bishop on d3. I can play:

make_move d3e2

This move attacks White's king directly with check. Since the king must respond to a check, this will give me time to address other threats on the board. It's a strong move that puts immediate pressure on my opponent.

- My king is on g7
- I have rooks on a8 and g8
- White has a pawn on b4 and a4, and rooks on a1 and f1
- White's king is on e1

I notice my bishop on f3 is attacking along the diagonal and could potentially create threats. One strong move would be to activate this bishop further with:

make_move f3d5

This move:
1. Places my bishop on a strong central square
2. Controls important central squares
3. Increases my bishop's mobility
4. Creates potential threats against White's position

The d5 square is a strong outpost for my bishop, from where it controls several important squares and can participate more actively in the game.

After analyzing the position and available moves, I can see I'm playing as Black with two bishops (on f6 and a2), two rooks (on a8 and g8), and my king on g7. White has pawns on a4 and b4, with the white king on e1 and a rook on f1.

I notice my bishop on a2 can move to several good squares. Moving it to e6 would establish a strong diagonal presence and put pressure on White's position.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

I'll analyze the position and make a move.

Looking at the board, I'm playing as Black and I notice:
- I have two bishops on e6 and f6, both actively placed
- My king is on g7 with rooks on a8 and g8
- White's king is on d3 with a rook on f1
- White has two pawns on a4 and b4, while I have pawns on a7, c7, f7, g7, and h7

One of my strongest options is to use my bishop on f6 to attack. The bishop on f6 has several good diagonal moves, and I can potentially create threats against White's king.

I'll play the bishop move f6-c3, which puts pressure on White's position and attacks the square b4 where White has a pawn.

I notice that my bishop on c3 is attacking White's king on d3, giving check. I should capitalize on this tactical opportunity. The best move appears to be to reinforce the attack with my other bishop.

I notice my bishop on c3 is attacking the white king on d4, giving check. I should capitalize on this advantage. Looking at the legal moves for the c3 bishop, I can either maintain the check by moving to another square or potentially win material.

The move c3e1 looks particularly strong as it maintains the check while attacking the white rook on f6. This creates a double attack (fork) on the king and rook.

I'm playing as Black and have two bishops (on d4 and e1), a king on g7, and rooks on a8 and g8. I also have pawns on a7, c7, f7, and h7. 

White has a king on d3, a rook on g5, and pawns on a4 and b4.

Looking at my legal moves:
- g7h8, g7f8, g7h6, g7f6: These are king moves
- e1g3: This is a bishop move from e1 to g3

The bishop move e1g3 looks particularly strong as it checks the White king at d3. This would force White to respond to the check and give me the initiative.

One strong move is to activate my bishop on d5 by moving it to f3, putting pressure on White's position and controlling more of the board.

After analyzing the position, I see I have several good options. I notice my king is on g7, I have bishops on e5 and f3, and my opponent's king is on d3.

One of the strongest moves appears to be attacking the white king with my bishop:
f3e4

This move puts pressure on the white king and controls important central squares. The bishop on e4 would be attacking the c2 and d3 squares, putting direct pressure on the white king.

After analyzing the position and available moves, I see that I have two bishops (on e4 and e5) and my king is on g7. White's king is on d3, and I have several tactical opportunities.

One of the strongest moves I can make is to use my bishop on e4 to check the white king:

make_move e4f3

This move puts my bishop on f3, directly checking the white king on d3. This forces White to respond to the check, giving me the initiative. It's a strong attacking move that puts pressure on White's position.

One strong move would be to advance my bishop to control more squares and restrict White's king further. The bishop on f3 can move to e4, putting pressure on the position.

Looking at the position, I see I have several pieces that can move: my king on g7, rooks on f8, bishops on e4 and g3, and pawns on c7, f7, and h7.

The position appears to be in the endgame phase with material advantage for Black (I have two rooks and two bishops against White's lone king on b2). With such an advantage, I should aim to coordinate my pieces to deliver checkmate.

One strong move would be to use my bishop on e4 to control more of the board while putting pressure on White's king. The move e4b7 looks particularly good as it controls important squares around White's king while maintaining my bishop's activity.

I'll analyze the position and make a strong move as Black.

Looking at the board, I notice:
- I have two bishops (on b7 and g3), two rooks (on f8 and g8), and my king on g7
- White's king is on c1, quite far from my pieces
- I have several pawn advances available

The bishop on b7 has excellent mobility and could be used to attack. The bishop on g3 also has good diagonals. My rooks are connected but could be better positioned.

One strong move would be to improve my rook position with f8e8, centralizing the rook and preparing to use the e-file.

Another good option is to advance the bishop on b7 to create threats - particularly b7e4 which would control important central squares.

After consideration, I'll centralize my rook:

After analyzing the position and the legal moves, I can see I'm playing as Black with a strong position. I have my king on g7, rooks on e8 and g8, bishops on b7 and g3, and several pawns.

The white king is exposed on c1, and my queen is on a8. This looks like a winning position for Black, and I should look for decisive moves.

One of the strongest moves I see is to use my bishop on g3 to attack along the diagonal. The move g3e1 would put the bishop on e1, creating a powerful threat against the white king on c1.

I notice my bishop on e1 is attacking the white king on d1, delivering check. This is a powerful position that I should capitalize on. Since the white king is in check, White will be forced to respond to this threat on their next move.

I'll move my bishop on e1 to capture the checking bishop:

I notice I have a bishop on f2 that's attacking diagonally and could deliver a powerful move. Looking at the legal moves, I can see that moving this bishop to e1 would be a checkmate - it controls the e1 square while my rooks control the c1 and d1 squares, trapping the white king.

I see the position now. As Black, I'm in a critical position:

- My king is on g7
- White has a queen on g6 threatening me
- I have bishops on b7 and e1, and a rook on e2
- I have three legal moves for my king: g7g8, g7h6, or g7f6

Let me analyze each option:

1. g7g8: Moving to the back rank limits my king's mobility and doesn't escape the queen's attack.
2. g7h6: Moving to h6 puts me directly next to the white queen, which is extremely dangerous.
3. g7f6: Moving to f6 gets me away from the white queen's immediate attack.

The best move is clearly to move away from the white queen's attack:

After analyzing the position and available moves, I see I have a very strong position as Black. I have two bishops and a rook against just a king.

The most decisive move here is to use my rook to deliver checkmate. I can see that my rook on e2 can move to e1, which would be checkmate since the white king on b1 has no escape squares and no pieces to block or capture my rook.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

I need to analyze this position carefully. I have two bishops, a rook, and my king with some pawns. Let me evaluate the best move.

Looking at the position, I notice:
- My king is on g7 with pawns for protection
- I have a bishop on b7 with good diagonal control
- I have a bishop on e1 controlling the a5-e1-h4 diagonal
- My rook is on e3, currently on an open file

One of my strongest pieces is the rook on e3. I can use it to create immediate threats or control important squares. Since the white king appears to be on a2, I can consider moves that put pressure on White's position.

The move e3e2 looks particularly strong as it:
1. Controls the 2nd rank
2. Prepares potential checks or threats against the white king
3. Maintains flexibility for the rook

I need to analyze this position carefully. I have two bishops, a rook, and my king with some pawns, while White appears to have just a king and a pawn.

Looking at the legal moves, I notice my rook on e2 has many options, and I should use it aggressively since it's my strongest piece. The most forcing move would be to check the white king, which is on a3.

I'll play my rook to a2, which delivers check and also attacks White's pawn on a3.

Thank you for providing the legal moves. I notice there's a discrepancy in the board representation - the bishop that appeared on a8 in the board visualization actually has legal moves from a6 (a6c8, a6b7, etc.), so it must be on a6 instead.

Looking at this position, I have a significant material advantage with two bishops and three pawns versus just White's king. My goal should be to promote one of my pawns to a queen while keeping control of the position.

I'll advance my c-pawn which has the clearest path to promotion:

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Thank you for providing the legal moves. Let me analyze the position and make a strong move.

I notice I have two bishops, which are powerful long-range pieces. The bishop on e1 is particularly well-positioned, controlling the long a5-e1 diagonal and putting pressure on White's position.

Looking at my options:
- I could develop my bishop on a6 to a more active square
- I could advance my pawns to create more space
- I could improve my king's position

The bishop on e1 is already well-placed, so I'll focus on improving my other pieces. Moving the a6 bishop to c4 would place it on a strong diagonal and control important central squares.

Now I can see the board position. I'm playing as Black and I have two bishops (on c4 and g5) and my king is on g7. White's king is on c2, and I have pawns on c5, f5, and h5.

Let me check what legal moves I have available.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

After analyzing the position and my legal moves, I see I have two bishops that can potentially deliver checkmate. Let me evaluate the best option.

I notice my bishop on g3 can move to f2, which would be checkmate since the white king on c2 would be attacked by my bishop with no legal escape squares.

I'll make this winning move:

Now I can see all my legal moves. Let me analyze the position:

I have a significant material advantage with two bishops and three pawns versus just White's king. This is a winning position for Black. My goal should be to coordinate my pieces to force checkmate.

Looking at the position, I notice my bishop on f2 can move to e3, which would put White's king in check. This is a strong move as it restricts the White king's movement and begins to set up a mating net.

I'll make this move:

Thank you for providing the legal moves. I can see I have several options as Black.

Looking at the position, I notice I have two bishops and a king against White's lone king. This is a winning position for me, and I should aim to coordinate my pieces to force checkmate.

One strong move would be to advance my bishop from e3 to f4, which controls important squares and helps restrict the White king's movement. This move maintains control of the diagonal while putting pressure on White's position.

Looking at the position, I notice my bishop on e3 (which appears to be a dark-squared bishop) has several good options. Moving it to g5 would increase its activity and control more of the board while putting pressure on the center.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

I need to analyze this position carefully. I'm playing as Black with my king on g7, and I have two bishops (on g5 and c4) and two pawns (on h5 and f4). White has just the king on b1.

Looking at the legal moves, I notice I have several strong options:
- I could move my bishop to f1 with c4f1, which would be checkmate
- I could move my bishop to e2 with c4e2, which would also be checkmate

Since both moves lead to checkmate, I'll choose the most direct one:

- My king on g7
- Two bishops (on g5 and g2)
- Pawns on c5, f4, and h5

The White king is on b2, and I have several strong pieces controlling key squares.

Looking at my options, I notice my bishop on g2 has excellent mobility. I can use it to create a strong threat while maintaining control of important diagonals.

I'll move my bishop from g2 to e4, which:
1. Controls central squares
2. Creates pressure toward White's position
3. Maintains good coordination with my other pieces

After analyzing the position and my legal moves, I see I have several good options. I have two bishops and three pawns against just a lone king, so I'm clearly winning.

My priority should be to advance one of my pawns to promote to a queen, which will make checkmate much easier. The f-pawn is the most advanced and has a clear path.

I'll advance my f-pawn:

Now I have a clear picture of the position and my available moves. Let me analyze the situation:

1. I have a significant material advantage with two bishops and three pawns versus just a lone king.
2. My goal should be to promote one of my pawns while keeping control of the position.
3. The f-pawn is the most advanced, so pushing it forward makes sense.

Looking at the legal moves, I can advance my f-pawn from f3 to f2, which brings it one step closer to promotion. This is a strong move as it advances my winning plan.

I see the board position. White has made the first move d2-d4 (pushing the d-pawn forward two squares). Now I need to decide on my response as Black. Let me check what legal moves I have available.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Now I can see all my legal moves. As Black responding to White's d4 opening, I have several strong options:

1. e7e5 - directly challenging the center
2. d7d5 - establishing a classical central pawn structure
3. c7c5 - the Sicilian-like approach against d4
4. g8f6 - developing the knight to a good square
5. e7e6 - preparing for a solid defense

Among these, I'll choose one of the most principled responses to d4, which is to establish a pawn presence in the center with d7d5. This creates a balanced central pawn structure and is a solid classical approach.

Now I can see all my legal moves. As a professional chess player, I'll analyze the position:

White has played b3 and d3, setting up for a potential fianchetto with the bishop on b2. I've already played d5, controlling the center.

For my move, I want to develop my pieces and control the center. One of the strongest moves here is to develop my knight to f6, which controls important central squares, prepares for castling, and follows good opening principles.

After analyzing the position and available moves, I notice I have the opportunity to castle kingside with "e8g8" which would improve my king's safety and connect my rooks.

This is a strong move in the current position as:
1. My king will be safer on the kingside
2. It activates my h8 rook by connecting it to the rest of my pieces
3. The pawn structure on the kingside provides good protection

After analyzing the position, I can see I'm playing as Black in what appears to be a middle game position. I have several good options, but I notice my king is still in the center and I should consider castling for safety.

Looking at the legal moves, I see that I can castle kingside with g8h8. This would bring my king to safety and connect my rooks. Given the open position and the fact that White has some pieces developed toward the center, castling seems like a priority.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

After analyzing the position, I see several good options. I notice my king is on h8 and I have a rook on f8, which means I could castle queenside with "f8g8". This would improve my king's safety and connect my rooks.

I also see tactical opportunities with my knights on c6 and f6, and my bishop on c8 has potential to develop.

Given the position, I'll castle kingside to improve my king's safety and connect my rooks:

After analyzing the position, I see several good options. I notice my king is on g8 and I have a bishop on g7 that's currently blocked. My knights are on c6 and f6, and I have a pawn on d5 that could capture on e4.

Looking at the position more carefully, I see that White has a bishop on h7 which is putting pressure on my kingside. I should address this threat while developing my pieces.

One strong move is to develop my dark-squared bishop with:

make_move c8e6

This develops my bishop to a good diagonal, helps control the center, and prepares for potential kingside castling later. The bishop on e6 will protect my d5 pawn and add pressure to the center.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

After analyzing the position and my available legal moves, I'll make my decision.

The position appears to be in the middle game with both kings castled. I notice my king on g8 is somewhat exposed with the white bishop on h7 pointing at it. I should prioritize king safety and development.

Looking at my options:
- I can improve my king's safety by moving it to f8 or e8
- I can develop my pieces further or create threats
- I need to be mindful of any tactical opportunities

One strong move is to develop my knight on c6 to e5, which would attack the d3 square and potentially the white pawn on f3, while also improving my piece positioning.

1. I'm playing as Black and have a fairly developed position
2. White's queen is on h5, potentially threatening my kingside
3. I have knights on e5 and f6, bishops on e6 and g7
4. My king is on g8 with rooks on c8 and g8

Looking at my options, I want to improve my king's safety. Moving the king to f8 seems prudent as it gets out of potential threats along the g-file and maintains protection of my g7 bishop.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

After analyzing the position, I see several promising options:

1. The knight on e4 is very active and can make several strong moves, particularly e4f2 which would fork the white king and rook.
2. I could develop my dark-squared bishop with e6f5 or e6g4.
3. I could improve my king's safety with castling (f8g8 or h8g8).

The most forcing and immediately advantageous move appears to be the knight fork:

Player_Black (to Proxy):

After analyzing the position, I see several key elements:

1. I'm playing as Black and have a material advantage
2. My king is on h8 with rooks on c8 and f8
3. White has a knight on c4 that's threatening my pawn on d6
4. I have a bishop pair (e6 and g7)
5. My knight on g4 has several active options

I'll play a strong move that improves my position:

make_move g4e3

This knight move to e3 is powerful because:
1. It attacks White's king on e1
2. It creates a fork threat against White's king and potentially other pieces
3. It moves my knight to a more central and active square
4. It increases pressure on White's position

This aggressive move should force White to deal with the immediate threat rather than pursue their own plans.

Looking at the position more carefully, I see that moving my knight from c2 to e3 would be a strong move. This develops the knight to a more central square, puts pressure on White's position, and prepares for further action.

1. My king is on g8 with rooks on c8 and f8
2. White's king is on f3, somewhat exposed
3. I have a knight on g2 that could potentially create threats

Among my options:
- The knight on g2 has several moves (h4, f4, e3, e1) that could create tactical opportunities
- I could improve my bishop on e6 by moving to f5
- I have standard pawn moves available

The knight on g2 looks particularly active and could create threats against White's king. Moving it to e3 would create a fork threat against White's king and possibly other pieces.

After analyzing the position, I see several good options. I notice my king is on h8 with a rook on f8, and I have the opportunity to improve my king's safety with castling.

The move Kg8 (h8g8) would be a strong choice as it:
1. Improves my king's safety
2. Connects my rooks
3. Moves my king away from the h-file where it could be vulnerable

I notice I have a knight on e3 that has several good options. I also have two bishops (on e6 and g7) that could be developed better. My queen and rooks are already in decent positions.

One of the strongest moves I see is to activate my knight on e3 by moving it to g4, which would put pressure on White's position and potentially threaten f2 if the bishop on e6 coordinates with it.

After analyzing the position and my legal moves, I see several interesting options:

1. I have a knight on g4 that can attack White's pieces or create threats
2. My dark-squared bishop on e6 can move to improve its position
3. My light-squared bishop on g7 has several diagonal moves
4. I have standard pawn moves available

Looking at the position more carefully, I notice my knight on g4 has a particularly strong move to h2, which would fork White's king on g2 and rook on h1. This is a winning tactical opportunity.

Thank you for providing the legal moves. Let me analyze the position:

I see I'm playing as Black and have several interesting options. Looking at the board:
- My king is on g8 with a rook on f8
- I have two bishops - one on e6 and one on g7
- White's king is on g1, somewhat exposed
- I have a knight on h2 that could be active

After evaluating the options, I see a strong move with my knight on h2. The knight can attack White's position by moving to f3, creating a fork threat against White's rook on b1 and potentially other pieces.

The knight on f3 is particularly well-positioned and can make several strong moves. I also see that my dark-squared bishop on g7 is aimed at the long diagonal.

I'll play a strong knight move that increases my control of the center and puts pressure on White's position:

make_move f3e5

This knight move to e5 establishes a strong outpost in the center, controls important squares, and increases my piece activity. From e5, the knight exerts pressure on multiple squares including c4, d3, f3, and g4, potentially creating tactical opportunities.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Let me analyze the position and make a strong move as Black.

I see I have a complex middlegame position with active pieces. Looking at the legal moves, I notice several tactical and strategic options:

1. My knight on e5 is well-placed and has multiple potential moves
2. I have two bishops that could be developed further
3. My rooks on c8 and f8 need coordination

The knight on e5 seems particularly strong, and I should consider if there are any tactical opportunities with it. The move e5g4 looks interesting as it attacks the h-pawn while potentially setting up future tactics.

Another strong consideration is developing my light-squared bishop on e6 further with e6f5, which would increase its scope.

After evaluating the position, I believe the most active and threatening move is to move my knight to g4, putting pressure on White's kingside.

I can see that I'm playing as Black and my king is on g8. The position looks quite tense. I only have two legal moves available: g8h8 and g8h7, which are both king moves.

Looking at the position:
- My king is on g8 with limited mobility
- I have a bishop on g7 protecting the king
- There's a white bishop on h7 that could be threatening me
- I need to ensure my king's safety

Between moving to h8 or h7, h8 is the safer square as it keeps my king protected by the bishop on g7 and avoids any potential immediate threats.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

After analyzing the position and my available legal moves, I can see several interesting options:

1. My knight on g4 is active and has multiple attacking options
2. I have two bishops aimed at the kingside
3. My rooks are connected on the back rank

One strong move I see is to attack White's king with my knight:

make_move g4h2

This move attacks White's king directly, creating a serious threat. If White's king moves, I can capture the rook on h1. If White tries to defend with g3, I can retreat the knight while maintaining pressure. This aggressive move puts immediate pressure on my opponent.

I see I'm playing as Black and have several tactical opportunities. Looking at the board:
- My king is on g8 with a rook on f8
- I have a bishop on g7 that's active on the long diagonal
- I have a knight on h2 that appears to be attacking something
- White's king is on g1

One of the strongest moves I see is my knight on h2 capturing something on f1, which appears to be a fork or tactical shot.

I'll play a strong attacking move by developing my knight to g3, which puts pressure on White's position and threatens the h-pawn.

Looking at the position, I need to assess my options carefully. 

I notice several key features:
- I have two bishops (on e6 and g7) and a knight on g3 that are actively placed
- My king on g8 is relatively safe but could use more protection
- White has a knight on f4 that's somewhat threatening
- I have a rook on f8 that could be developed

After analyzing the legal moves, I see a strong opportunity to improve my position by developing my knight on g3. The knight on g3 can make a powerful move to e4, where it would be centralized and attacking White's d-pawn.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

After analyzing the position, I see several promising options. I notice my knight on e4 is active and could make some strong moves. I also have two bishops that could be developed further.

Looking at the position more carefully, I see that my knight on e4 can attack White's knight on f2, which would be a strong tactical move. This would fork the White king on h1 and potentially another piece.

After analyzing the position, I see several strong options as Black. I have active pieces, particularly my bishops on e5 and e6, and a knight on f2 that's deep in White's territory.

Looking at the position, I notice:
1. My knight on f2 is attacking White's king on g4
2. I have two bishops aimed toward the kingside
3. White's king is on g3, somewhat exposed

One of the strongest moves appears to be Nf2-h3+, which would give check and potentially lead to a strong attack or material gain.

Let me analyze the position:

I see I have two bishops (on e5 and e6), a knight on h3, and my king is on g8 with rooks on c8 and f8. My queen is on d8. White's king is on g3, which is quite exposed.

Looking at the legal moves, I notice my knight on h3 has some interesting options, including a potential fork with h3f2 which would attack White's king and possibly another piece.

Let me check the e5 bishop - it can move to g7, f6, d6, f4, or d4. The e6 bishop can move to d7, f5, or g4.

Given White's exposed king position, I think the best move is to use my knight to create a tactical threat.

3. White's king is exposed on g3, which could be exploited.
4. My dark-squared bishop on e5 is attacking White's knight on f4.
5. I have two bishops (e5 and e6) that are well positioned.

Looking at my options, I see a strong tactical opportunity: my bishop on e5 can capture the knight on f4, which would remove a defender near White's king and potentially set up further threats.

Among my legal moves, I see some tactical opportunities:

The bishop on e6 can attack White's h3 pawn with Bh3, which would threaten the pawn while also maintaining control of important diagonals.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

After analyzing the position, I see several good options as Black. 

I notice my king is on h8 with a rook on f8, and I have a bishop on g6 that's actively placed. White has a king on g3 and a rook on d4, with a bishop on e5.

One of the strongest moves here is to improve my bishop's position with the diagonal move:

make_move g6e4

This move:
1. Attacks White's d-pawn on d3
2. Improves my bishop's activity on the long diagonal
3. Creates potential threats against White's king position
4. Maintains control of important central squares

The bishop on e4 will be well-placed to participate in any attacking plans while targeting White's pawns.

I need to analyze the position carefully before making my move.

Looking at the board, I see that:
- I'm playing as Black with my king on h8
- White has a king on g3 and a bishop on e5
- I have a bishop on e4 that's currently attacking several squares
- Material seems roughly equal, but I need to consider tactical opportunities

One of the strongest moves I see is to use my bishop to attack White's king position. The move e4g2 puts the bishop on g2, which creates a powerful attack against White's king on g3. This would be a check and forces White to respond.

3. I have a rook on c8 and f8, and my queen on d8

Looking at the available moves, I notice my bishop on e4 has a particularly strong diagonal. I'll check if it can create any immediate threats or improve its position.

The move e4f3 looks strong as it maintains the bishop's activity while putting pressure on White's position. This diagonal controls important squares and maintains flexibility.

Looking at the board, I notice:
- I'm playing as Black with my king on g8
- White has a rook on g1 and king on h1
- I have my queen on d8 and rooks on c8 and f8
- There's a bishop on h1 that appears to be mine
- The pawn structure is somewhat broken on both sides

The most critical aspects of this position:
1. My king safety is important
2. I should consider my piece coordination
3. I should look for any tactical opportunities

Among my legal moves, I see that I can improve my king's safety by moving the rook to cover the king with f8g8. This completes the king's protection and maintains good piece coordination.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

I can see all my legal moves now. Let me analyze the position:

1. I'm playing as Black and have a bishop on h1, which is deep in White's territory
2. Material seems roughly equal, but I need to be careful about my king's safety
3. I have a rook on c8 and a queen on d8 that could be developed better

Looking at my options, I notice I can improve my king's safety by castling queenside (moving the king from g8 to e8). This would connect my rooks and bring my king to a safer position.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

I need to analyze the position carefully before making my move.

Looking at the board, I notice:
- I'm playing as Black with my king on g8
- White has a bishop on f2 and a rook on g1, with the white king on h1
- I have a bishop on h1 that's attacking the white king
- The position seems to be in the middlegame/endgame phase

One of my strongest moves is castling kingside with e8g8, which would improve my king safety. However, I already have a bishop on h1 giving check to the white king, which is a critical tactical situation.

The move h1g2 with my bishop would capture White's rook on g1, winning material while maintaining the check on the white king.

I'll make this move:

- My king is on h8 and could potentially castle with the rook on e8
- I have material advantage with a queen and two rooks
- The white bishop on h5 is attacking along the a2-g8 diagonal

Looking at my options, I see a particularly strong move: the bishop on g2 can deliver checkmate by capturing on h1.

- I have several pawn moves and piece development options

The most powerful move I see is to deliver check with my bishop from h1 to e4, which attacks White's king. This move also controls important central squares and puts immediate pressure on White.

One of the strongest moves appears to be castling kingside with e8g8 (O-O), which would connect my rooks and bring my king to safety. This is a standard priority in the middlegame.

1. h8g8 - Moving my king from h8 to g8
2. h8h7 - Moving my king from h8 to h7
3. d8g8 - Moving my queen from d8 to g8

Looking at the position, I notice that:
- My king is on h8 with the white rook on g7 nearby
- I have a queen on d8
- White has a bishop on g4 and a knight on a3
- There appears to be a potential checkmate threat

The move d8g8 (queen to g8) seems strongest as it protects my king from immediate threats along the g-file. Moving the king to g8 would be dangerous with the white rook on g7, and moving to h7 might walk into a check.

I'm playing as Black and have several strong pieces: a queen on g8, rook on c8, and bishop on e4. I notice my bishop on e4 is well-positioned and has many potential moves.

Looking at the position, I see that my bishop on e4 can capture a piece on h1. This appears to be a free capture, as h1 is typically where a White rook would be. Taking a rook would be a significant material gain.

I'll make this capture:

Player_Black (to Proxy):

I need to analyze this position carefully. 

I'm playing as Black and I see that:
- I have my king on h8, a rook on c8, and a queen on f8
- White has a bishop on e5 threatening my queen
- White has a knight on a3 and the white king is on g1

My queen on f8 is under attack by the white bishop on e5, so I need to address this immediately. Looking at my legal moves, I have several options for the queen:
- f8g8, f8e8, f8d8 (moving along the rank)
- f8g7, f8e7 (moving diagonally)
- f8h6 (moving to h6)

I also need to consider my overall position and king safety.

The best move appears to be to move my queen to h6, which gets it out of danger while maintaining an active position.

I notice my queen on h6 has many potential moves, and I have a rook on c8. The White king is on g1 with limited protection. My king is on h8, and I should consider its safety as well.

Looking at the legal moves, I see an opportunity for a powerful queen move. The queen on h6 can move to c1, which appears to be a checkmate since the White king on g1 would have no escape squares and no pieces that can block or capture the queen.

I'm playing as Black and have a queen on h1, a rook on c8, and a king on h8. I need to make a strong move.

Looking at the legal moves, I notice several key options:
- I can move my queen to various squares
- I can move my rook along the 8th rank
- I can move my king to g8, h7, or g7

The most striking opportunity I see is that my queen on h1 appears to be attacking White's king on g7 with no pieces in between. This would be checkmate.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

I can see the current position and my legal moves. Let me analyze the situation:

As Black, I have:
- A rook on c8 and h8
- My king on g8
- Pawns on a7, b7, c7, d4, and f7
- White has a knight on a3, bishop on h5, king on g2, and some pawns

Looking at my options, I notice:
- I can move my king to g7, which would be risky with the white bishop on h5
- I can move either rook along the back rank
- I have various pawn moves available

The most pressing concern is the white bishop on h5 which is putting pressure on my kingside. I should consider either defending against potential threats or developing my pieces.

I'll move my king to g7, getting out of the back rank and preparing to activate my rooks.

I notice my rook on c8 is undefended, but it's not under immediate threat. My king on g7 is safe for now. I should consider improving my position.

One strong move would be to centralize my rook to control the open e-file:

2. White has a king on h6, a bishop on h5, a knight on b4, and several pawns
3. The position appears to be in the endgame phase

One of my strongest pieces is the rook on e8, which currently has an open e-file. I should use this rook actively to either attack White's pieces or control important squares.

Looking at my options, I notice I can use my rook to attack White's d-pawn on d4. This would put pressure on White's position and potentially win material.

3. White has a king on h2, a knight on b5, a bishop on f6, and pawns on a6, b2, and d4

Before deciding on my move, let me check what legal moves are available to me.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Now I understand my available moves. I need to make a careful decision as Black.

Looking at the position:
- My king is currently on g7 and can move to g8, f8, h7, h6, g6, or f6
- I notice that White's bishop on f6 is controlling g7-h8 diagonal and the f6 square
- White's knight on b5 is not directly threatening me
- My rook on e4 is active and potentially threatening White's position

Analyzing the king moves:
- Moving to f6 would be a blunder as it's controlled by White's bishop
- Moving to g8 or f8 seems reasonable to keep my king safe
- Moving to g6 could be risky as it brings my king closer to White's king
- Moving to h7 or h6 might be safer options

I think the best move is to go to h7, keeping my king safe while maintaining flexibility.

The move e4e2 looks particularly strong, as it:
1. Controls the 2nd rank
2. Threatens White's b-pawn
3. Maintains flexibility for my rook
4. Keeps pressure on White's position

1. Move my rook to e1 to prepare a back-rank checkmate
2. Capture White's pawn on e3 if there is one (though I don't see it clearly on the board)
3. Move my king to safety

Given the legal moves available, I'll use my rook to attack on the e-file by moving it to e1, which threatens checkmate if White doesn't respond appropriately.

You are a professional chess player and you play as black. Now is your turn to make a move. Before making a move you can pick one of the following actions:
- 'get_current_board' to get the schema and current status of the board
- 'get_legal_moves' to get a UCI formatted list of available moves
- 'make_move <UCI formatted move>' when you are ready to complete your turn (e.g., 'make_move e2e4')

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

After analyzing the position, I see that I'm playing as Black with my king on h7 and a rook on g1. White has a king on h5, a knight on b5, a bishop on f6, and several pawns.

I need to make a strategic decision. My rook on g1 is very active and controls the g-file. I should consider either:
1. Moving my rook to threaten something important
2. Protecting my king which appears to be somewhat exposed
3. Advancing my pawns to create threats or prepare promotion

Looking at the legal moves, I see that I can use my rook to control more of the board. Moving it to the first rank would give me control of the back rank.

Let me check what legal moves I have available.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Now I can see all my legal moves. Let me analyze the position:

1. I have a rook on e1 with many possible moves
2. My king can move to several squares (g8, h6, g6)
3. I can move my b7 pawn forward or capture on a6
4. I have a material advantage with a rook vs. bishop and knight

The most pressing issue is that White's bishop on f6 is attacking my king on g7. I need to address this threat. I could:
- Move my king away from the bishop's attack
- Capture the bishop with my rook (but I don't see that as a legal move, so it must not be possible)

Looking at the position, moving my rook to e8 seems strong as it controls the back rank and maintains pressure. Alternatively, I could move my king to g8 to get out of the bishop's attack.

I'll choose to move my king to g8 to escape the bishop's attack.

Now I can see my legal moves. Let me analyze the position:

1. I have a rook on e1 that can capture White's bishop on e7, which would be a significant material gain.
2. My king has several safe moves available.
3. I have pawn moves available, but none are particularly critical at the moment.

The most obvious strong move is to capture the bishop with my rook. This would give me a material advantage without any immediate drawbacks that I can see.

2. White's knight on c7 is threatening my b7 pawn
3. My king could use more safety

Among my options, I see a strong move with my rook. I can use it to check the white king while maintaining control of the e-file.

I need to analyze this position carefully. 

I'm playing as Black with my king on g8 and a rook on e6. White has a king on h5, a knight on c7, and several pawns. My rook on e6 is very active and controls the e-file.

Looking at the legal moves, I have several strong options:
1. I could move my rook to attack White's pawns or control more territory
2. I could improve my king's position

The most powerful piece I have is my rook on e6, which is already well-positioned on an open file. I notice I can use it to attack White's d4 pawn while maintaining control of the e-file.

I'll make this move:

The strongest move appears to be using my rook to attack on the e-file, particularly targeting the back rank where I could potentially deliver checkmate.

I'll move my rook to safety while maintaining control of the e-file:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

I can see the current position and my legal moves. Let me analyze the situation:

1. I'm playing as Black with my king on g8
2. I have a rook on e1 (7th rank)
3. White's king is on g4
4. There's a white knight on c7 that's threatening my position

Looking at my options, I notice I have a powerful rook on the first rank that can deliver a check. This is a strong move that will force White to respond to the check.

I'll play:

make_move e1e4

This move checks the white king directly. It's a strong attacking move that forces White to respond by either moving the king or blocking the check. This gives me the initiative and puts pressure on my opponent.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

I can see all my legal moves now. Let me analyze the position:

I'm playing as Black and have a rook on e4 that's currently attacking White's pawn on d4. My king is on g8, and I have pawns on a7, b7, and f7. White's king is on g3, and there's a white knight on e5 that could be threatening some squares.

Looking at my options, I notice my rook on e4 has many possible moves. The most promising appears to be capturing the d4 pawn with my rook, which would win material. However, I should check if this is safe.

The white knight on e5 doesn't directly defend the d4 pawn, and I don't see immediate threats to my rook if I capture. Taking the pawn would give me a material advantage.

I'll make this move:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Thank you for providing the legal moves. Let me analyze the position and make the best move.

I notice several key aspects of the position:
- My rook on d4 has many options, including the possibility to capture White's king on g4 with d4g4
- However, this would be an illegal move in chess as you cannot capture the king
- The move d4g4 being listed as legal suggests this might be a variant or the board representation has an error

Looking at the legitimate tactical opportunities:
- My rook on d4 can check the White king with d4h4
- I can also advance my pawns, particularly b7b5 which would capture White's pawn on b5

The strongest move appears to be checking the White king with my rook, which forces a response and gives me the initiative.

The most powerful move here is to use my rook to deliver checkmate. I can play Rh4-h1#, which is a checkmate because the white king on g4 has no escape squares and cannot block or capture the rook.

I see the position now. I'm playing as Black and I have a king on g8, pawns on a7, f7, and d5, and a rook on h1. White has a queen on b8, a king on g4, a knight on a4, and a pawn on b5.

Let me check what legal moves I have available.

g8h7,g8g7

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

I see that I have only two legal moves available: g8h7 or g8g7, both king moves.

Looking at the position, I need to be careful as White's queen on b8 is controlling several squares. My king is currently on g8, and I need to move it. 

Between the two options:
- g8h7 moves my king to the h-file
- g8g7 moves my king down one rank

The g8g7 move seems safer as it keeps my king closer to my pawn structure and away from the edge of the board where it could get trapped. Moving to g7 also maintains better control of the f8 square and keeps my king more centralized.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

I need to analyze this position carefully. 

I'm playing as Black and I notice:
- My king is on g7
- I have a rook on h1
- I have pawns on a7 and d5
- White has a queen on c7, a king on g4, a knight on a4, and a pawn on b4

The most pressing issue is that White's queen on c7 is threatening my king. I need to address this immediately. Looking at my legal moves:

1. Moving my king: g7h8, g7g8, g7f8, or g7h7
2. Using my rook: Various moves including h1h8, h1c1, etc.
3. Moving my pawns: a7a6, a7a5, or d5d4

Since White's queen is threatening my king, I must either move my king to safety or capture the queen. I don't have a direct way to capture the queen, so I need to move my king.

The safest square appears to be h8, as it gets my king away from the queen's attack and into the corner where it has fewer exposed squares.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

After analyzing the position and my legal moves, I need to make a critical decision.

The most pressing issue is that White's queen on c7 is threatening my king, but not delivering check yet. However, if I don't address this threat, White could play Qc8# next move.

My best move is to use my rook to defend against this threat by moving it to h7, creating a defensive barrier between White's queen and my king. This prevents the immediate checkmate threat.

I need to analyze this position carefully as Black.

Looking at the board:

- White has a king on g4, a queen on c1, a knight on b7, and a pawn on b4
- I have pawns on a7, f7, and d5

Key observations:
- My rook on h7 is undefended and could be captured by White's queen
- White's knight on b7 is threatening my a7 pawn
- My king on g7 appears safe for now

Best moves to consider:
1. h7h8 - Moving the rook to safety while maintaining control of the h-file
2. g7f8 - Moving the king to safety
3. f7f5 - Advancing a pawn to gain space

After careful consideration, I'll move my rook to safety while maintaining control of the h-file.

- White has a king on g4, a queen on b1, a knight on b6, and pawns on b4
- I need to be careful about potential checks or threats

The most critical aspect is my king's safety. White's queen on b1 is currently not directly threatening me, but could become dangerous. The knight on b6 is also a piece to watch.

My rook on e8 is undefended but has good mobility along the e-file. I could use it to create threats or defend key squares.

After evaluating the position, I'll use my rook to control the 4th rank, which would restrict White's king movement and potentially set up future threats.

I can see the current position. I'm playing as Black and I have a rook on e5, pawns on a7 and f7, and my king on g7. White has a queen on b1, a knight on d4, a pawn on b5, and the white king on g4.

Let me check what legal moves I have available.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Now I understand my available moves. Let me analyze the position:

1. I have my rook on e5 which is currently attacking the white knight on d4
2. The white queen on b1 is far from the action
3. The white king is on g4, and my king is on g7

Looking at my best options:
- I can capture the knight with my rook: e5d4
- I can check the white king with my rook: e5g5 or e5h5 (but these aren't in my legal moves list, so the rook must be pinned or these squares are protected)
- I can advance my f-pawn with f7f5, potentially threatening the white king's position

The most forcing and immediately beneficial move appears to be capturing the knight with my rook.

- I have a rook on d4 and pawns on a7 and f7
- White has a king on g5, a queen on b1, a knight on c7, and a pawn on b5

Let me check what legal moves I have available.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Now I can see all my legal moves. Let me analyze the position:

1. My rook on d4 is active and controls the d-file
2. White's queen on b1 is far from my king, but could become dangerous
3. White's knight on c7 is threatening my rook on d4
4. White's king is on g5, somewhat exposed

The most pressing issue is that White's knight on c7 is threatening my rook on d4. I need to either move the rook to safety or capture something valuable with it.

Looking at my options, I see that my rook can move along the 4th rank or the d-file. Moving to d8, d7, or d6 would be safe from the knight. Moving along the 4th rank to e4 or beyond would also escape the knight.

The most active move appears to be to keep the rook on the 4th rank where it controls important squares and maintains pressure. Moving to h4 would put pressure on White's position while staying safe from the knight.

I'm playing as Black with my king on g7. White has a queen on g6, a knight on c6, and a king on g4. I have a rook on h4 and pawns on a7 and f7.

White's queen on g6 is threatening my king, so I must address this immediate check. I have three options:
1. `g7h8` - Move my king to the corner
2. `g7f8` - Move my king to the left
3. `f7g6` - Capture the white queen with my pawn

The best move is clearly to capture the white queen with my pawn, eliminating the immediate threat and winning a major piece.

Key observations:
- I have my king on g7 with a pawn on g7 and a rook on h4
- White has a king on g5, a knight on c7, and a pawn on b5
- My rook on h4 is currently undefended but not under immediate attack
- I need to consider both my king's safety and potential attacking opportunities

Looking at the position, I notice I can deliver a check with my rook while also attacking White's knight. This would force White to address the check and potentially allow me to win material.

- h7
- f7

Looking at the position, I need to make a good king move. The white king is on g4 and the white knight is on e8. I should keep my king safe while maintaining control of key squares.

Moving to f7 seems best as it keeps my king centralized and away from potential knight forks. It also maintains control over my pawn on g7 and stays connected to my rook on c5.

I can see that White has played 1.b4, which is known as the Sokolsky Opening or Polish Opening. This is an uncommon first move that aims to control the c5 square and potentially develop the bishop to b2.

Let's check my legal moves to respond to this.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Looking at the legal moves, I have several good options against White's 1.b4 opening. 

The most principled response is 1...c5, directly challenging White's control of the center and attacking the b4 pawn. This is a common and strong reply to the Sokolsky Opening.

Other solid options include 1...e5 (claiming central space) or 1...d5 (controlling the center).

I'll go with the most direct and challenging response:

Looking at the position and my available moves, I should focus on development and control of the center. One of the strongest moves here is to develop my knight to f6, which controls the center, prepares for castling, and puts pressure on e4.

1. White has knights on a3 and f3
2. I have knights on f6 and b8
3. I have a pawn on b4 that seems advanced
4. My c-pawn and g-file rook are missing

Thank you for providing the legal moves. Now I can analyze the position and make a decision.

Looking at the position, I notice several key factors:
- I should continue my development
- The knight on b8 can move to c6, which would develop a piece and control important central squares
- Moving Nc6 is a standard developing move that would strengthen my position

The move Nc6 (b8c6) looks best as it:
- Develops a piece
- Controls central squares (d4 and e5)
- Prepares for potential castling
- Follows opening principles of developing knights before bishops

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Thank you for providing the legal moves. Let me analyze the position and make a strategic decision.

Looking at the position, I notice White has an unusual setup with knights on a5 and h5. The knight on h5 is particularly aggressive and could potentially threaten my f6 knight or g7 pawn.

Among my options:
- I could capture the knight on h5 with Nf6xh5
- I could develop pieces with moves like e7e6 or d7d5
- I could address the knight on h5 by playing h7h6

The most pressing concern is the knight on h5, which is somewhat exposed. Taking it would gain material and remove a potential threat.

3. I could capture White's knight with Nxa3 (b4a3)

The knight on a3 is undefended, so capturing it would win material. This is a clear advantage, so I'll take the knight.

If White captures with the knight, I can recapture with my e-pawn, strengthening my central pawn structure.

- 'get_current_board' to get the schema and current status of the board
- 'get_legal_moves' to get a UCI formatted list of available moves
- 'make_move <UCI formatted move>' when you are ready to complete your turn (e.g., 'make_move e2e4')

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Thank you for providing the legal moves. Let me analyze the position and make a decision.

I notice several key aspects of the position:
- I have knights on f5 and h4 that are quite active
- White has a knight on e5 that's threatening my position
- My king is still in the center, which could be vulnerable

Looking at my options, I see a few strong candidate moves:

1. e5f7 (Knight takes on f7) - This would attack White's king and queen simultaneously, winning material
2. e5c4 - This knight fork would attack White's bishop on d6 and potentially other pieces
3. e8e7 - Castling isn't available, so king safety is important

The knight move e5f7 looks particularly strong as it creates a fork. Let me make this move:

One of the strongest moves I see is developing my bishop to e7, which would protect my king and prepare for castling. This is a solid developing move that addresses my king's safety.

The position shows White has developed pieces toward the center and kingside. My king is still in the center, and I have the opportunity to castle. This would significantly improve my king's safety and connect my rooks.

1. My king is on g8 with the rook on f8, so I should consider king safety
2. I have a knight on h5 that could be developed better
3. My dark-squared bishop on e7 could be activated

Looking at the position, I notice my knight on h5 can make a strong move to f4, putting pressure on the center and potentially threatening White's position. This knight move improves my piece activity and controls important central squares.

I'll develop my bishop from f7 to g6, which:
- Improves my bishop's activity
- Controls important central squares
- Prepares for potential kingside play

- Places it centrally

Player_Black (to Proxy):

I'll analyze the position and make a move as Black.

Looking at the board, I notice:
- White has developed their queen to c2 and has bishops on d4 and f2
- Black has both knights developed (e6 and f7) and bishops on d6 and e6
- The black king is on g8 with the rook still on f8

I see several good candidate moves:
1. Castling with g8h8 would improve king safety
2. Developing the rook with f8e8 would connect the rooks
3. Moving the knight f7-h6 or f7-e5 could improve knight positioning

After consideration, I'll castle kingside to improve my king's safety, which is a priority in this middlegame position.

After analyzing the position and available moves, I see I'm playing as Black in what appears to be a complex middlegame position. 

I notice that:
- White has developed strongly with both bishops and the queen
- My king is on h8 without castling
- I have knights on e6 and f7, and bishops on d6 and e6
- The position is somewhat open

One of the strongest moves I can make is to develop my rook to e8, which puts pressure on the e-file and improves my piece coordination.

After analyzing the position, I see several strong options for Black. I notice I have two bishops, two knights, and the queen available for active play.

The position appears to be in the middle game with some pieces already exchanged. White has a queen on b2 that's quite active, and I need to consider both defensive needs and attacking opportunities.

One particularly strong move I see is developing my knight on f7 to g5, which would attack White's bishop on d2 while also improving my piece positioning.

I need to analyze the position carefully before making my move.

Looking at the board, I notice:
- White's queen is on f3 attacking my kingside
- I have knights on e6 and g5
- My king is on g8 with limited protection
- White has two bishops on d4 and e4 pointing toward my kingside

The most pressing concern is my king's safety. I should either strengthen my king's position or counter-attack.

Among my options:
- `g8f8` would move my king to a safer square away from the h-file
- `e6f4` would attack White's queen with my knight
- `g5f3` would capture White's queen, though I need to check if it's protected

The knight capture on f3 looks very strong if it's available. Let me make that move.

After analyzing the position and my available moves, I notice several important factors:

1. My king is on g8 and could use some breathing room
2. I have two bishops (on d6 and e6) and two knights (on e6 and f3) that are actively placed
3. White has two bishops on d4 and e4 that are controlling important diagonals

One strong move I see is to develop my rook to e8, which would:
- Connect my rooks
- Control the open e-file
- Prepare for potential kingside castling (manually by moving the king to f8)

2. I have active bishops on e6 and d6 with multiple possible moves
3. My knight on f3 is well-positioned with several options

Given the position, I think castling is a priority to secure my king's safety before continuing with development and attacking plans.

After analyzing the position, I can see that I'm playing as Black and there are several interesting tactical opportunities.

I notice that my knight on f3 is attacking White's bishop on e5, and I also have a bishop on e6 that could potentially develop an attack. The position looks somewhat complex with pieces actively placed.

One strong move I see is to capture the bishop on e5 with my knight:

- My king is on g8 without castling rights
- White has two bishops on d4 and e4, creating pressure
- I have knights on e5 and e6 that are active
- There's a pawn on f6 that appears to be White's

One of my strongest moves appears to be moving my knight from e5 to c4, which attacks White's pawn on d2 while developing to a good square.

3. I have two bishops (on d6 and e6) with good diagonals
4. White has two bishops on d3 and d4

The knight on c4 is particularly well-positioned, putting pressure on White's position. I can strengthen my position by developing my bishop on d6 to a more active square.

I'll play the bishop to e5, which controls important central squares and puts pressure on White's position:

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Let me analyze the position and my available moves:

I notice I'm playing as Black and the position appears to be in the middle game. Looking at the board:
- My king is on g8
- I have knights on e6 and c4
- My queen is on d8
- I have a bishop on c8
- I have rooks on a8 and h8

Let me consider some key moves:

1. Knight c4 has several good options, particularly c4e3 which attacks White's bishop on d4.
2. Knight e6 has options including e6c5 which could pressure White's position.
3. I could develop my bishop with c8d7 or similar, but that's not in the legal moves list.
4. I could castle queenside with g8f8 to improve king safety.

After evaluating the options, I think the most active move is to attack White's bishop with my knight.

I notice that:
- My king is on g8 with no pieces directly defending it
- White has two bishops aimed at my kingside (d4 and e5)
- I have a knight on e6 that could be developed better
- My queen is on d8 and could be more active

Looking at the legal moves, I should prioritize king safety and piece development. The knight on e6 is well-placed but could be even better positioned. Moving my queen to develop with tempo or protecting my king position seem like good options.

I'll move my knight from e6 to c5, which develops the piece to a strong central square, puts pressure on White's position, and avoids any immediate threats.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Let me analyze the position and make a good move as Black.

I see that I'm playing as Black and the position is quite complex. Looking at the board:

1. My king is on g8 with a rook on a8 and h8
2. I have a knight on e4 that appears to be quite active
3. White has two bishops (on d4 and e4) and a rook on b3 that's putting pressure on my queenside

Key observations:
- My knight on e4 is well-positioned and could potentially fork pieces
- I should consider king safety as White has active pieces

Among my legal moves, I see some promising options:
- e4f2: My knight can fork White's king on d3 and rook on g1
- e4c3: My knight could attack White's pawn on a2
- d7d5: Developing with central pawn push

The knight fork with e4f2 looks strongest as it attacks White's king and rook simultaneously.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

I need to analyze the position carefully before making my move.

Looking at the board, I notice:
- White has two bishops on d3 and e3, a rook on b2 and g1, and the king on c1
- I have a knight on f2 which is actively placed in White's territory
- My king is on g8 with limited protection
- White has pawns advanced on e5 and f5, creating some space advantage

Among my legal moves, I see several strong options:

1. Knight moves from f2 - this knight is very active and can potentially fork pieces
2. King safety moves like Kf8 or Ke8
3. Queen moves to improve position or create threats

The knight on f2 is particularly strong and I should consider if there's a tactic available. Looking at the f2 knight's options, Nf2-d1 would attack White's rook on g1 and potentially win material.

I'll make this move:

2. White has two bishops (d3 and e3) and two rooks (b2 and g2)
3. I have a knight on d1 that appears to be active
4. There's a white rook on b2 that could be threatening my queenside

Looking at my options, I notice my knight on d1 has several good moves. Moving it to e3 would attack White's bishop pair simultaneously, which is a strong tactical opportunity.

I notice my knight on e3 is quite active and threatening White's position. I also see that my king is on g8 with potential safety concerns since the White rook is on b2 and could potentially attack along the second rank.

One strong move would be to develop my knight further with e3f5, putting pressure on White's position and controlling key central squares.

The position appears complex with White having a rook on c3 and another on g2, plus a bishop on d4. I'm a knight down (only have one knight on f5), but I need to ensure my king's safety and develop my pieces.

Looking at the legal moves, I notice:
- My king is on g8 and can move to f8 or e8
- My queen on d8 has several options
- My knight on f5 is active and has multiple possible moves
- I have undeveloped pieces including a rook on a8

One strong move would be to castle queenside with my king, which would connect my rooks and improve my king's safety:

After analyzing the position and my legal moves, I notice several key factors:

1. I have a knight on f5 that's actively placed and could potentially create threats
2. My king on g8 is somewhat exposed with the white rook on c3 potentially threatening the c-file
3. White has a bishop on d4 that's controlling some key diagonals

Looking at my options, I think developing my pieces and improving my king safety is important. The move Rf8-e8 looks strong as it:
- Connects my rooks
- Protects the e-file
- Prepares for potential kingside castling (O-O)
- Maintains flexibility in my position

1. I could castle kingside with e8g8 (O-O), which would improve my king's safety
2. I have a knight on f5 that can make several moves
3. I have pawn moves available

The position appears somewhat complex. White has a rook on c3 and another on g2, with the white king on c2. My king is still in the center, so castling would be a priority for safety.

Looking at the position more carefully, I notice that castling kingside (e8g8) is legal and would be a strong move to improve my king's safety. This is typically a high priority in the middlegame.

I need to analyze this position carefully. 

Looking at the board, I notice:
- White's king is exposed on b2
- My knight on f5 is active and could be useful for an attack
- White has a rook on g7 that could be threatening
- I need to consider both defensive needs and attacking opportunities

After evaluating the position, I see a strong knight move that creates multiple threats:

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Looking at the board position and my legal moves, I need to make a strategic decision.

I notice that:
- My king is on g8 with no immediate threats
- I have a knight on d4 that's centralized and has many options
- White has a rook on g7 that could be threatening
- I have several pawn moves available

The knight on d4 is my most active piece, and I can use it to create threats. The move Nd4-f3+ looks particularly strong as it gives check to the white king on a3 and also attacks the white rook on g1.

Now I have a clear picture of the position and my available moves. Let me analyze the situation:

1. My king is on g8 with the rook on a8 and h8
2. White has a rook on c3 and g6, and a bishop on d3
3. White's king is on a3, which is quite exposed
4. I have a knight on f3 that's actively placed and could be useful

Looking at my options, I notice my knight on f3 is well positioned and can make several strong moves. The move f3-d4 looks particularly strong as it:
- Attacks White's position centrally
- Could potentially fork pieces later
- Improves my knight's position

I'll make this move:

4. I need to consider both development and safety

The knight on d4 is particularly well-placed and could potentially fork pieces with moves like Nd4-e6 or Nd4-f3. The e6 move looks especially strong as it attacks both the rook on c7 and potentially the queen.

I'll make this move:

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Let me analyze the position:

I'm playing as Black and the position is quite complex. White has a rook on c3 attacking my c-file, another rook on g2, and a bishop on e4. My king is on g8, and I have a knight on e6 that appears to be under attack by White's pawn on f5.

Looking at the legal moves, I need to consider:
1. King safety - my king seems exposed
2. Piece activity and coordination
3. Addressing any immediate threats

The knight on e6 appears to be under attack by the f5 pawn, so I should consider moving it to a safe square while maintaining its activity. The knight on e6 has several good options including c5 (controlling central squares) or g5 (putting pressure on White's position).

I'll move my knight to c5, which develops it to a good central square where it controls important central squares and can't be easily attacked.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Thank you for providing the legal moves. Let me analyze the position:

I notice that:
1. White has a rook on b2 that's attacking my b-pawn
2. White has a bishop on e4 threatening diagonals
3. My knight on c5 is active and has several good options
4. My king is on g8 with potential safety issues

After evaluating the position, I see that my knight on c5 can make a strong move to e4, capturing White's bishop. This would remove a dangerous piece and improve my position.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

I'll analyze the position:

I'm playing as Black and I notice:
- White has two rooks (on b4 and g2) and a king on a3
- I have my king on g8, queen on d8, knight on e4, and other pieces
- My king is on g8 with no pieces directly defending it
- I have a powerful knight on e4 that has several options

Looking at my options, I see a strong tactical opportunity with my knight on e4. I can fork White's king on a3 and rook on g2 with:

make_move e4c3

This knight move attacks both White's king and rook simultaneously. Since the king is in check, White will be forced to move it, allowing me to capture the rook on g2 on my next move. This is a classic knight fork tactic that will win material.

I need to analyze this position carefully. I see that:

1. White has two rooks on the b and g files (b5 and g5), creating pressure
2. My king is on g8 with limited mobility
3. I have a knight on c3 that has several possible moves
4. My queen on d8 has multiple options

Looking at the position, I notice White's rooks are threatening my position. My knight on c3 is active and could potentially create threats. I should prioritize king safety while developing counterplay.

The move Nc3-e4 looks strong as it:
1. Develops my knight to a central square
2. Creates potential threats against White's position
3. Maintains flexibility for future moves

3. My king is on g8 with some vulnerability
4. White's king is exposed on a3

Looking at my options, I see several promising moves:

1. Knight moves from e4 could attack White's pieces or create threats
2. I could develop my pieces further
3. I need to be careful about the rook on b4 threatening my b7 pawn

The knight on e4 is particularly well-placed and could create threats. The move e4f2 looks strong as it would attack White's rook on g1 while also threatening the pawn on a2 with a fork.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Looking at the board position and legal moves, I need to make a strategic decision as Black.

I notice several key aspects of the position:
- White's king is exposed on b4
- I have a knight on e3 that's well-positioned
- White has a rook on g7 that's threatening my position
- I have a queen on d8 that could be developed

One of the strongest moves appears to be moving my knight from e3 to c4, which would check White's king and potentially win material.

After analyzing the position, I see several interesting options:

1. I have a knight on c4 that's actively placed and could make several moves
2. My queen on d8 has multiple options
3. I have a rook on g7 that could be developed
4. My king is on h8 and could move to g8

Looking at the position more carefully, I notice White's rook on g3 is attacking along the g-file, and my rook on g7 is defending. White's king is on b2, which seems quite exposed.

One of the strongest moves appears to be developing my queen to create threats while maintaining defense. I'll play:

I notice my queen on e7 has many possible moves, my knight on c4 is active, and I have a rook on g7 that could be developed. White's king is exposed on a4, and there's a white rook on g3.

Looking at tactical opportunities, I see that my knight on c4 can fork White's king and rook with:

make_move c4d2

This knight move delivers a fork between White's king on a4 and rook on g3, winning material. Since the king is in check, White will have to move it, and I'll be able to capture the rook on the next move.

After analyzing the position and my legal moves, I notice several important factors:

1. I have a material advantage with a queen, two rooks, a bishop, a knight, and several pawns
2. White's king is exposed on a4 with little protection
3. My queen on e7 has many potential moves

Looking at this position, I can deliver a checkmate with my queen:

Player_Black (to Proxy):

I apologize for the error. Let me check the legal moves again and make a valid move.

Looking at the position more carefully, I see that my queen on e7 can't directly reach a3. Let me select a strong move from the legal moves list.

Since White's king is exposed on a4, I can attack it with my queen:

make_move e7a3

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Player_Black (to Proxy):

I apologize for the confusion. It seems I made the same error again. Let me carefully review the legal moves list you provided:

The legal moves are: h8g8, a8b8, g7g8, g7f7, g7g6, g7g5, g7g4, g7g3, g7g2, g7g1, e7f8, e7e8, e7d8, e7f7, e7f6, e7e6, e7d6, e7g5, e7e5, e7h4, e7e4, e7e3, e7e2, e7e1, f3g5, f3e5, f3h4, f3d4, f3h2, f3d2, f3g1, f3e1, b7b6, a7a6, b7b5, a7a5

I see that e7a3 is not in this list. Looking at the position again, I notice White's king is on a4 and my queen on e7 can move to e4, which would put pressure on the king.

One of my strongest moves is to attack with my queen:

make_move e4b4

This move puts direct pressure on the white king at b3. The queen is attacking from b4, just one square away from the king, creating an immediate threat. Since there doesn't appear to be any piece protecting the b4 square, this creates a powerful check that will force the white king to move, giving me the initiative.

After analyzing the position, I see I have several strong options as Black. I have a rook on g2 that's very active, and a knight on f3 that's centralized. 

The most powerful move I see is to use my rook on g2 to attack White's king on b2. This creates an immediate threat that White must respond to.

Looking at the position and my legal moves, I need to make a strategic decision. 

I notice that:
- I have a knight on f3 with several options
- I have a rook on b2 that's active on the 2nd rank
- White's king is exposed on a4
- White has a rook on g7 that's threatening my position

One of my strongest moves appears to be moving my rook on b2 to check White's king. This would force White to respond to the check and give me initiative.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

After analyzing the position, I see that I'm playing as Black and have several interesting options. 

The position shows that:
- I have a knight on f3 with multiple possible moves
- I have a rook on a2 that's active on the 2nd rank
- My king is on g8 with White's rook on g7 nearby
- White's king is on b4

Looking at my options, I notice my rook on a2 is threatening White's king on b4. This is a very powerful position that I should capitalize on.

I'll play:
make_move a2b2

This move delivers check to White's king and forces it to move. Since the king is already on the edge of the board, this severely restricts White's options and maintains my attacking pressure.

I have several strong options:
1. I could attack White's king with my knight (f3d2, f3e1)
2. I could move my rook on b2 to attack White's king (b2c2)
3. I could develop my pieces with moves like b8d8

The most decisive move appears to be using my rook to check the White king:

1. I have a knight on f3 that's actively placed
2. I have a rook on c2 that can move along multiple files
3. White has a rook on g7 that's penetrated my position

The most pressing threat appears to be the white rook on g7, which is deep in my territory. I should consider either defending against potential threats or creating counterplay.

Among my options, moving my rook to c7 looks particularly strong as it attacks the 7th rank where White's king is vulnerable, and it could potentially lead to checkmate threats. This move maintains pressure while improving my piece position.

Looking at the position strategically:
1. My knight on f3 is well-placed and has many potential moves
2. My rook on c7 is under attack and needs attention
3. I have a potential king move to g8

The most pressing issue is my rook on c7 being attacked by White's rook. I should either move it or defend it. Moving my rook to c6 would capture White's rook, which seems like the strongest move.

The knight on f3 is well-positioned and has several good options. I notice that my knight can fork White's king and pawn with Nd2+, which would be a check and threaten the h7 pawn.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

After analyzing the position, I see I have several options. I'm playing as Black and have a material advantage with two rooks, a bishop, a knight, and several pawns against White's king and a pawn.

Looking at my legal moves, I notice I can:
1. Move my king (h8g8)
2. Develop my rook on a8 (a8b8)
3. Move my rook on a6 in various directions
4. Move my knight on d2 to several squares
5. Advance my pawns on b7 or d7

Given that White's king is exposed on c3, I should look for tactical opportunities. The knight on d2 is particularly well-positioned to create threats.

I'll move my knight to b3, which checks the king and also attacks the pawn on h7:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

I need to analyze this position carefully. As Black, I have several pieces to consider:
- My king on h8
- Rooks on a8 and a6
- Knight on b3
- Bishop on c8
- Pawns on a7, b7, d7, and h7
- White's king is on b2

Looking at the position and my legal moves, I notice a few key opportunities:

1. My knight on b3 is attacking White's king on b2, but it's not checkmate as the king can move.
2. I have a rook on a6 with many possible moves along the 6th rank and a-file.
3. My king can move to g8.

The most pressing concern is to capitalize on my knight's attack. Since the knight is already giving check, I should look for the strongest follow-up. Moving my rook to a2 would create a powerful attack.

I can see this is an endgame position where I'm playing as Black. Let me analyze the position:

I have a king on h8, a rook on a8, a bishop on c8, a knight on b3, and pawns on a7, b7, d7, and h7. White has a king on a2 and a pawn on h6.

Looking at my legal moves, I should consider:
1. Knight moves (b3 to various squares)
2. Pawn advances
3. King and rook moves

The knight on b3 is very active and could potentially create threats. Moving it to c5 would be a strong central position that controls important squares.

I'll make this move:

Looking at the legal moves and the board position, I can see I have several good options as Black. Since I have a significant material advantage, I should focus on advancing my position strategically.

The knight on c5 has several good options, and I also have pawn moves available. Given that I have a material advantage, I should work toward checkmate. Moving my rook to b8 would increase its activity and put pressure on White's king on b2.

I notice the White king is on c1, and I can use my knight effectively to control key squares. Moving my knight to d3 would put pressure on the king while being protected by my bishop on c6.

Looking at my legal moves:
- I can move my king to g8
- I can move my rook to a8
- I have several knight moves from d3
- I can advance my pawns

The most important goal is to checkmate White's king. My knight on d3 can control important squares around White's king. Moving it to b2 would put White's king in check and restrict its movement.

Thank you for providing the legal moves. Let me analyze the position and make the best move.

I see I have several options:
- King moves: h8g8 (though my king appears to already be on g8 from the board display)

- Rook moves: b8a8
- Pawn moves: b7b6, a7a6, d5d4, b7b5, a7a5

Given the endgame position with few pieces left, I should activate my pieces. The bishop is currently blocked, so developing it would be good. Among the bishop moves, c8f5 looks strong as it controls more squares and puts pressure on the center.

Thank you for providing the legal moves. Let me analyze the position and make a strong move.

I notice several important aspects of the position:
- I have a material advantage with a rook and bishop versus no major pieces for White
- White's king is exposed on a6
- I have several attacking possibilities

Looking at my options, I see that I can attack White's king with my bishop by moving to e6, which would put the king in check.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Thank you for providing the legal moves. Let me analyze the position:

I have a significant material advantage with a rook and bishop versus just a king. My goal should be to advance toward checkmate while being careful not to stalemate White's king.

Looking at the position, I notice:
- My king is on g8
- My rook is on b8
- My bishop is on e6
- I have pawns on a7, b7, and d5
- White's king is on a2 with a pawn on h7

One of the strongest moves here would be to centralize my rook, which will increase its activity and control more of the board. Moving the rook to e8 puts it on an open file and creates more mating possibilities.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Now I can see all my legal moves. Let me analyze the position and make the best move.

I notice I have several strong pieces and a material advantage. Looking at the position:

1. My king is on g8 and White's king is on b1, far away
2. I have a rook on e8 and a bishop on e6
3. I have several pawn moves available

The most promising moves appear to be:
- Advancing my d-pawn with d5-d4
- Developing my bishop with moves like e6-f5 or e6-d7
- Moving my rook along the e-file or 8th rank

Since I have a material advantage, I should focus on advancing my d-pawn which can potentially become a passed pawn and promotion threat. This is a concrete plan that puts pressure on White.

2. I have a bishop on e6
3. I have pawns on a7, b7, d4, and h7
4. White's king is on c2 with a pawn on h6

Looking at my legal moves, I notice I can castle kingside with "e8g8". This is a strong move that will improve my king's safety and connect my rooks (though I only see one rook on the board currently).

Given the endgame-like position with reduced material, king safety is important, and castling is a developing move that improves my position.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Looking at the position, I need to make a strategic decision as Black. I have several key pieces to consider:
- My king on g8
- A rook on g8
- A bishop on e6
- Pawns on a7, b7, d4, and h7

The white king is on d3, which is quite advanced. I should consider both my safety and potential attacking opportunities.

Among my options, I see that I can:
1. Move my king along the back rank or to g7
2. Move my bishop in various directions
3. Advance my pawns

Given that my king appears somewhat exposed, I'll prioritize king safety while maintaining control of the position. Moving the king to f8 seems prudent as it maintains protection while clearing the g-file for my rook to potentially become more active.

I notice I have my king on g8, rook on f8, bishop on e6, and pawns on a7, b7, d3, and h7. White only has a king on d1 and a pawn on h7.

Since I have a winning position, I should aim for a quick checkmate. Looking at my legal moves, I can see that moving my rook to deliver check would be strong. The move f8f1+ would deliver check and control the first rank.

I can see the current position. I'm playing as Black and I have a rook on f1, a bishop on e5, pawns on a7, b7, h7, and d3, and my king on g8. White has a king on d2 and a pawn on h6.

Let me check what legal moves I have available.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Now I can see all my legal moves. Let me analyze the position:

I have a significant material advantage with a rook, bishop, and several pawns against White's lone king and pawn. Looking at the position, I notice my rook on f1 is undefended but also completely free to move along the f-file or the first rank.

The most decisive move here appears to be to use my rook to deliver checkmate. I can play Rf1-f2+, which would place White's king in check with no legal moves - it's checkmate.

After analyzing the position and my available legal moves, I see several strong options. 

I have a completely winning position with my rook and bishop against White's lone king (the h6 pawn is not a significant factor). My best strategy is to coordinate my pieces to force checkmate.

One of the strongest moves is to bring my rook to the first rank to restrict White's king:

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Now I can see all my legal moves. Let me analyze the position:

I have a bishop and three pawns against White's lone pawn. This is a winning advantage for me. My king is on g8, and I should consider improving my position.

Looking at the moves available, I notice:
- I can advance my pawns
- I can move my bishop to various squares
- I can move my king

Since I have a material advantage, my priorities should be:
1. Advance pawns toward promotion
2. Coordinate my pieces to support the pawns
3. Bring my king to the center to help control the board

The most immediate pawn advance would be d3-d2, which threatens promotion. This is a very strong move as it forces White to deal with this immediate threat.

Looking at this position as Black, I have several strong options. With my queen on d1 and the white king on c3, I can deliver a decisive check.

The move Qd1-b3+ looks particularly strong as it checks the white king and threatens mate. This forces the white king to move, and I can follow up with more checks or capturing material.

Thank you for providing the legal moves. I notice there's a discrepancy in the board representation - my queen appears to be on b6 in the board diagram but the legal moves suggest it's on b3. I'll work with the legal moves list as that's more definitive.

Looking at the position, I have several strong options. My queen on b3 has many potential moves, and my bishop on e6 can also move in various directions.

Since White's king is exposed on d2 and my queen is on b3, I can deliver a check and potentially set up a mating attack:

I notice I can deliver a checkmate with my queen by moving to c2, which would attack the white king on c1 with no escape squares.

I have my king on g8, a bishop on e6, and pawns on a7, b7, and h7. White has a king on c2 and a pawn on h6.

Looking at the available moves, I should consider:
1. Advancing my pawns to create passed pawns
2. Using my bishop effectively
3. Keeping my king safe

Since White's king is far away on c2, I can try to advance one of my pawns. The b-pawn has potential to become a queen, so I'll push it forward two squares.

I'll move my bishop to f7, which protects my king, controls important squares, and maintains flexibility.

- Pawns on a7, b5, and h7
- White's king is on e1 and there's a white pawn on h7

Looking at my legal moves, I need to make a strategic decision. The bishop on f7 is my most active piece, and I should consider how to best use it.

Since I have a bishop vs no minor pieces for White, I should try to maximize its activity while keeping my king safe. The move f7-c4 stands out as it:
1. Places the bishop on a strong diagonal
2. Controls important central squares
3. Puts pressure on White's position

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Thank you for providing the legal moves. Let me analyze the position:

I have a bishop on c5 (which appears as c4 in the legal moves notation), and it has several possible moves. I also have pawn moves available with a7-a6, a7-a5, or b5-b4.

Looking at the position, I notice my bishop is very active on c5, controlling the a7-g1 diagonal. I should consider whether to maintain this bishop or use it to improve my position further.

Given that I have a material advantage (bishop and three pawns vs one pawn), I should focus on advancing my pawns while maintaining control with my bishop.

The move b5-b4 advances my pawn toward promotion without weakening my position. This creates a passed pawn that will require White's attention.

Looking at my options, I notice several strong bishop moves. The bishop is my most active piece, and I should use it effectively. Since the white king is on c1, I can create threats with my bishop.

The move c4e2 looks particularly strong as it attacks the back rank, potentially setting up checkmate threats while staying safe from the white king. This diagonal control will limit White's king movement.

Since my king appears safe at the moment, I'll use my bishop to gain better control of the board. Moving the bishop to c4 gives me good diagonal control and puts pressure on the center of the board.

Now I can see all my legal moves. Let me analyze the position:

I have my king on g8, a bishop on c4 (not c5 as I initially thought), pawns on a7, b4, and h7. White has a king on c2 and a pawn on h6.

Looking at my options, I notice several strong bishop moves. The bishop is my most active piece, and I should use it effectively. I could:

1. Attack the white king with Bc4-e2, putting the king in check
2. Move the bishop to safer squares while maintaining control
3. Advance my pawns

The most forcing move is to check the white king with Be2+, which would force the king to move and give me initiative.

1. Move my king: h8g8
2. Move my bishop on e2 to various squares (a6, h5, b5, g4, c4, f3, d3, f1, d1)
3. Move my pawns: a7a6, a7a5, or b4b3

Looking at the position, I notice I have a bishop on e2 that's attacking the white king on d4. This is a check. I should capitalize on this tactical opportunity.

The best move is to capture the white king with my bishop:

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Thank you for providing the legal moves. Let me analyze the position:

I have several options with my bishop on d3 (which appears as d6 from my perspective as Black), my king on h8 (g8 in the list), and my pawns.

Looking at the position strategically:
1. My bishop is very active on d3 and controls several important squares
2. I should consider advancing my pawns to create passed pawns

The most promising moves appear to be:
- d3e4: Moving my bishop to e4 would control more central squares
- a7a5: Advancing my a-pawn to create a passed pawn
- h8g8: Moving my king toward the center

After consideration, I believe advancing the a-pawn is best to create a potential passed pawn while maintaining my bishop's strong position.

I have several options with my bishop on d3, as well as pawn moves. Looking at the position critically:

1. My bishop is very active on d3 and controls important diagonals
2. White's king is on c1, which means my bishop can potentially deliver check
3. I have a pawn on h7 that's close to promotion but blocked by White's h6 pawn

The strongest move appears to be to check White's king with my bishop:

2. I have pawns on h7, a5, and b4
3. White has a king on c2 and a pawn on h6
4. My legal moves are:
   - h8g8 (King move)
   - a5a4 (Pawn advance)
   - b4b3 (Pawn advance)

This appears to be an endgame position. My strategy should be to advance my pawns to create passed pawns while keeping my king safe.

The move b4b3 advances my pawn closer to promotion and will require White's king to move away from the c-file to stop it. This creates a potential passed pawn situation.

I see that White has made the first move g2g3, playing 1.g3 (moving the g-pawn forward one square). This is a hypermodern opening approach that aims to control the center with pieces rather than pawns, and prepares for a fianchetto of the bishop to g2.

Let's check what legal moves I have available as Black.

Now I can see all my legal moves. Since White has played 1.g3, I'll respond with a solid classical approach.

I'll play 1...e5, establishing a presence in the center. This is a strong classical response that stakes a claim in the center and opens lines for my bishop and queen.

3. This is a standard developing move that follows opening principles.

I can see the current position. It appears we're in the early opening phase of the game. White has played some moves including b3, d3, and g3, developing their dark-squared bishop to b2. As Black, I have developed both knights to c6 and f6, and pushed my e-pawn to e5.

Let me check what legal moves I have available.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Thank you for providing the legal moves. Now I have a clear picture of my options.

Looking at the position, I should continue with my development. My knights are already developed, so I should focus on developing my bishops and preparing to castle.

One of the strongest moves here would be to develop my dark-squared bishop to e7, which protects my king, prepares for castling, and maintains control of important central squares.

1. White has developed the light-squared bishop to a3
2. I've developed both knights to c6 and f6
3. I've moved my e-pawn to e5
4. My dark-squared bishop is on e7
5. My light-squared bishop is on c8 (still undeveloped)

Player_Black (to Proxy):

After analyzing the position and my available legal moves, I see that I can castle kingside with e8g8, which is a strong move in this position. Castling will:

1. Bring my king to safety
2. Connect my rooks
3. Begin to activate my h8 rook by bringing it to the center

This is a natural developing move that aligns with good opening principles. I'll castle kingside now.

1. Develops my bishop to a more active square
2. Controls important central squares
3. Prepares for potential castling

- I have knights on c6 and f6, bishops on c8 and d6
- White has a bishop on a3 that's targeting my queenside
- I have a pawn on e5 that could be advanced

Looking at my options, developing my pieces and improving my position would be good. The move e5-e4 looks strong as it gains space in the center and challenges White's control. This advance could also open lines for my bishops.

After analyzing the position, I can see I'm playing as Black in what appears to be a middle game position. I have castled kingside, and my pieces are reasonably developed. I notice White has a knight on e5 that could be a threat, and I should consider my development and king safety.

Among my options, I see several knight moves that could improve my position. The knight on f6 could attack White's knight on e4, or I could develop my queenside with moves like b7-b5.

I'll choose to play b7-b5, which helps develop my queenside, controls the c4 square, and prepares for potential queenside play. This is a standard plan in many openings where Black has castled kingside.

Thank you for providing the legal moves. Now I can analyze the position and make a decision.

Looking at the position, I notice several key factors:
- My king is still in the center (on g8)
- I have not castled yet, and I have the option to castle kingside (h8g8)
- White has a bishop on a3 targeting my queenside
- My pieces are reasonably developed

Castling is a priority in the opening/early middlegame to get my king to safety. Since I have the option to castle kingside, that would be my preferred move in this position.

After analyzing the position, I see I'm playing as Black and have several options. I notice White has a knight on b4 that's attacking my position, and I have both knights developed.

Looking at the available moves, I'll focus on strengthening my position and continuing development. The e8 square seems like a good place for my rook, connecting my rooks and clearing the back rank.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

After analyzing the position, I can see I have several good options as Black. 

I notice I have the opportunity to castle kingside with "e8g8" (O-O), which would improve my king's safety and connect my rooks. This is typically a strong move in the middlegame.

I also have various knight moves and bishop moves available, but kingside castling stands out as a priority since:
1. My king is still in the center
2. The kingside is clear for castling
3. It will immediately improve my king's safety
4. It helps connect my rooks

I'll make this move:

1. My king is on g8 and I have a knight on f6 that's defending against potential threats
2. I have two bishops - one on c8 and one on d6
3. White has a knight on b4 that's somewhat active

I'll play a solid developing move that improves my position:

make_move c8b7

This develops my light-squared bishop to a good diagonal where it controls important central squares and supports my queenside. It also connects my rooks, which improves my coordination. This is a natural developing move that strengthens my position without creating any weaknesses.

The position shows I'm playing as Black with a fairly developed position. I notice my king is on g8, and I have knights on c6 and f6, bishops on b7 and d6, and my queen on d8.

Looking at the board, I see White has knights on b4 and d4 that are quite active. I should consider addressing these knights or continuing my development.

One strong move would be to develop my bishop on d6 to e5, which would attack White's knight on d4 while also controlling more central squares. This would put pressure on White's position.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

After analyzing the position and available moves, I notice several key factors:

1. My king is on g8 and appears to be relatively safe
2. I have a bishop on d4 that's actively placed and threatening White's position
3. I have knights on c6 and f6 that could be developed further
4. My queen on d8 has several possible moves

One of the strongest moves I see is moving my bishop on d4 to capture on f2, which would be a fork attacking White's rook and king simultaneously:

After analyzing the position, I see several key factors:

2. White has a knight on b4 that's attacking my position
3. My queen on d8 is currently undefended
4. I have knights on c6 and f6 that could be developed better

Looking at the legal moves, I should prioritize safety, development, and counterplay. One strong move is to develop my queen to a more active position while maintaining control of the center.

2. White has a knight on b4 that appears to be threatening my position
3. White's queen is on f4, which could be dangerous
4. I have knights on c6 and f6, and a bishop on b7

Before deciding on my move, let me check what legal moves I have available.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

After analyzing the position and my legal moves, I'll make my decision.

I notice White's queen on f4 and knight on b4 are active pieces. My queen on e7 is somewhat exposed, and I should consider improving my position.

One strong move is to develop my knight to e5, which attacks White's queen while also improving my piece activity. This knight move would put pressure on White's position and force a response.

The position appears to be in the middlegame with both sides having developed pieces. As Black, I notice my king is on g8 with a somewhat open position. I have knights on f6 and e5, with the e5 knight being particularly active.

One strong move I see is to develop my bishop on b7 to c6, which would control important central squares and put pressure on White's position.

After analyzing the position and available moves, I notice several important factors:

1. My king is on g8 and appears to be relatively safe
2. I have a queen on f8 and a rook on a8
3. White's queen is on g6, which could be threatening
4. I have a bishop on d5 and knights on e5 and f6

One of my strongest pieces, the bishop on d5, is attacking White's king on e4. This creates a check opportunity.

I'll make this move:

Looking at my options, I see several strong moves:
- Knight f6 to e4 would attack both the White queen and king simultaneously
- Bishop c6 to e4 would also attack the White queen
- Knight f6 to d5 could be strong, threatening White's position

The fork with Ne4 looks most powerful, attacking both the king and queen at once.

I need to analyze this position carefully. 

I notice that:
- I'm playing as Black with my king on g8
- White has a queen on f4 that's quite active
- I have a knight on f2 that's deep in White's position
- White's king is on e5, which is quite exposed in the center

Looking at my legal moves, I see several promising options:

1. Knight moves from f2 - particularly f2e4 looks strong as it attacks the White king with check
2. Bishop moves from c6 - especially c6e4 which would also check the king
3. Rook moves along the 8th rank

The move f2e4+ (knight check) seems particularly strong as it directly attacks the exposed White king. This forces the king to move and gives me the initiative.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

I need to analyze this position carefully. 

I see that White's queen is on e5, attacking my knight on e4. My knight is currently pinned to my king by White's bishop on f1. I also notice White's knight on b4 is attacking my c6 bishop.

Looking at the legal moves, I have several priorities:
1. Address the threat to my knight on e4
2. Improve my piece coordination
3. Consider king safety

One of the strongest moves appears to be moving my queen to protect the knight:
- `f8e8` would move my queen to e8, defending the knight on e4 while maintaining control of the f-file

This move maintains my material advantage, protects my knight, and keeps my queen active.

After analyzing the position and my legal moves, I notice several important factors:

1. I'm playing as Black and my king is on e8
2. White's queen is on e5, directly threatening my king
3. I need to address this check immediately

Looking at my legal moves, I have several ways to deal with the check:
- Move my king (e8f8, e8d8, etc.)
- Block with my knight (e4f6 or e4d6)
- Capture the queen with my knight (e4c5)

The best move here is to capture the queen with my knight, which eliminates the immediate threat and gives me a significant material advantage.

I apologize for the error. Let me check the board again more carefully. It seems I misread the position. Let me review the legal moves again.

I apologize for the confusion. Let me carefully review the board and legal moves again.

From the board representation:

- I have a knight on c6
- White has a queen on e5

Looking at the legal moves list again, I notice that "c6e5" is not listed among my legal moves. Let me select a valid move from the list.

I see that one of my legal moves is "c6e4", which would attack the white queen. This seems like a good move.

2. White's queen is on d4, threatening my knight on c5
3. I have a bishop on e4 that's attacking White's king on e5
4. My knight on c5 is under attack by White's queen

The most critical move here is to address the check on White's king. I have a direct check with my bishop on e4, and I should capitalize on this advantage.

Looking at the legal moves for my bishop (e4), I see several options. The strongest appears to be e4f3, which maintains the check while moving to a safer square.

Looking at the legal moves, I notice several strong options:
- My bishop on f3 has multiple attacking possibilities
- My knight on c5 can make several moves
- I need to ensure my king's safety

The bishop on f3 looks particularly strong, controlling the long diagonal. I'll use it to create a threat.

- I could also develop my king position

After evaluation, I see that my bishop on d5 can capture White's bishop on e4, which would be a strong move.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

After analyzing the position and available moves, I can see several key factors:

1. I have a bishop on e4 attacking the white king on e5
2. I have a knight on c5 that could develop into more active positions
3. My king is currently in the center (e8)

The most critical opportunity I see is that my bishop on e4 is directly attacking the white king on e5. This is a check situation that white must respond to.

I'll make this move:

make_move e4f3

This bishop check forces the white king to move and maintains pressure. The bishop at f3 will still control important diagonals and keep the white king under pressure while being protected by my pawn structure.

After analyzing the position and legal moves, I can see I'm playing as Black and have several options. 

I notice my king is on e8, and I have a knight on c5 and a bishop on f3. The position appears to be in the middle game with some pieces already exchanged.

Looking at my options, I see a few strong moves:
- The bishop on f3 has several good options, including attacking the white king on e2
- My knight on c5 has tactical possibilities
- I can also make king safety moves

One particularly strong move is to use my bishop to attack the white king with `f3e2`, putting the king in check and potentially winning material.

I'll analyze the position as Black:

The position looks complex with my king on e8 and several pieces in play. I notice my bishop on e2 is attacking the white king on e5, creating a check situation. I also have a knight on c5 that could be developed further.

Looking at the legal moves, I see several strong options:
- I could move my bishop (e2) to various squares while maintaining the check
- I could develop my knight from c5
- I could make a king move to safety

The most forcing move appears to be continuing the check with my bishop. Moving it to d3 maintains the check while also protecting my knight on c5.

3. My bishop on e2 is attacking the white king on e3
4. White's knight on c7 is threatening my queen on e8

Given these factors, I'll make a strong defensive move that also maintains pressure:

make_move e8f8

This move:
- Moves my king to safety
- Avoids any discovered check threats
- Maintains my bishop's attack on the white king
- Prepares to connect my rooks

Player_Black (to Proxy):

I need to analyze this position carefully. I'm playing as Black and have several options.

Key observations:
- My king is on g8 with the rook on h8 and queen on f6
- I have a bishop on e2 that's attacking diagonally
- I have a knight on c5 that could be developed
- White has a bishop on e4 that's threatening my position

Looking at my legal moves, I see some strong options:

1. The bishop on e2 is very active and could deliver a strong attack. Moving it to f3 would put pressure on White's king at e3.
2. The knight on c5 has several good outposts, particularly e4 which would attack White's king.
3. I could also consider king safety moves.

After evaluation, I believe the strongest move is to attack White's king with my bishop:

4. The white king is exposed on e3

One of the strongest moves appears to be moving my bishop from f3 to e4, which attacks the white king directly and creates a powerful threat. This puts immediate pressure on White and forces a response.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

After analyzing the position, I can see I'm playing as Black and have several good options. 

I notice my bishop on e4 is very active and threatening White's position. I also have a knight on c5 and my queen on f8 is aligned with White's king on e5. This looks like a tactically rich position where I might have some attacking chances.

One of the strongest moves appears to be moving my bishop from e4 to f3, which would attack White's king directly. This creates a powerful threat and forces White to respond.

After analyzing the position, I see several key elements:

1. I'm playing as Black and have a material advantage with a queen, rook, knight, and bishop vs White's rook and bishop
2. White's king is exposed on d4
3. My knight on c5 has several attacking options
4. My bishop on f3 controls important diagonals

I'll play a strong move that increases pressure on White's position:

make_move c5e4

This knight move to e4 is excellent because:
- It attacks White's king directly
- It's a fork that also threatens White's rook on e1
- It creates immediate tactical pressure
- The knight is protected by my pawn on d7
- It controls important central squares

This move should force White to deal with immediate threats and give me a decisive advantage.

1. I'm playing as Black and have several pieces: king on g8, rook on h8, queen on f8, knight on e4, bishop on f3, and several pawns.
2. White has the king on d4, which is quite exposed in the middle of the board.
3. I have my knight on e4 and bishop on f3 well positioned for an attack.

Looking at my options, I notice my knight on e4 can deliver a fork with e4f2, attacking both White's king and potentially another piece. This would be a powerful tactical move.

Let me make this move:

I need to analyze the position carefully before making my move.

Looking at the board, I see that:
- I'm playing as Black with my king on g8
- White has a rook on e5 that's attacking my d-pawn
- I have a bishop on f3 and a knight on f2 that are both active pieces
- My queen is on f6 and rook on f8

The most critical issue is the white rook on e5 attacking my d7 pawn. I should either defend this pawn or make a stronger counterattack.

I notice my bishop on f3 has excellent mobility and could create threats. Moving it to e4 would attack the white king on d4, creating an immediate check.

4. I have my queen on f6 and a bishop on f5 that could potentially attack White's king

Looking at my legal moves, I see an opportunity to attack White's king with my knight. The move Nf3-e4 directly attacks the white king and puts immediate pressure on White.

3. My bishop on e4 is very active and controls important diagonals
4. My king on g8 is relatively safe

The most pressing issue is that my queen is under attack. I have several good options:

1. Move the queen to safety (f8e8, f8d8, etc.)
2. Capture the attacking knight with the queen (not in the legal moves, so not possible)
3. Block with a pawn (not applicable here)

Since my queen is valuable and under attack, I'll move it to safety while maintaining control of important squares.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

I'll analyze the position and make a strategic move as Black.

Looking at the board:
- I have my king on e8 with a rook on g8 and queen on e5
- White has a king on d4 with rooks on e5 and g1, bishops on e1 and f1, and a knight on a8
- I have a knight on f2 that's actively placed in White's territory

The knight on f2 is particularly interesting - it's deep in White's position and could be used for a tactic. Let me consider my options:

1. Knight moves: My knight on f2 has several options (g4, e4, h3, d3, h1, d1)
2. King safety: I could castle by playing Kf8 or improve king safety
3. Pawn advances: I could advance pawns to gain space

The knight on f2 appears to be attacking White's rook on e4, which is a valuable piece. I should capitalize on this tactical opportunity.

I'm playing as Black and have a queen on e8, a rook on g8, and a knight on e4. White has a king on d4, bishops on e1 and f1, a rook on g1, and a knight on a8.

My knight on e4 is very well placed - it's centralized and putting pressure on White's position. I notice it can attack White's king with Nf2+, giving check. This looks like a strong move as it forces the king to move and could potentially lead to material gain or a tactical advantage.

I'll make this move:

2. White has a king on d4, rooks on g1, bishops on e1 and f1, knight on a8, and several pawns

Looking at my legal moves, I notice my knight on f2 has several strong options. It's in a great position and can potentially fork White's pieces.

The move f2-d3 looks particularly strong as it attacks White's king on d4 while being protected by my queen. This would create a check and force the White king to move.

- My knight on d3 is well-positioned, attacking White's king area
- My queen on e8 has many possible moves
- I notice my knight on d3 can deliver a fork with Nd3-f2, hitting White's king and bishop

This knight fork is a strong tactical opportunity that would win material.

- White has a bishop on a4 and another on f1, plus a rook on g1

Given the legal moves available, I see several promising options:

1. I could check White's king with my knight: f2-d3+ or f2-e4+
2. I could move my queen to threaten pieces or create threats
3. I could make a defensive king move

The knight check on e4 looks particularly strong as it attacks the king while also being protected by my pawn structure.

I notice that:
- I'm playing as Black with my king on e8 and a knight on e4
- White has two bishops on a3 and a4, and the white king is on d4
- My knight on e4 is attacking the white king on d4

This is a very interesting position where my knight on e4 is putting the white king in check. I should consider whether to maintain the check with another piece or make a different strong move.

Looking at my options, I see that moving the knight would remove the check and potentially lose the initiative. Since the knight is currently putting the white king in check and is well-positioned in the center, I should consider other moves that maintain pressure.

The move e4f2 would be a knight fork attacking both the white king and potentially another piece, but it would lose the check. Instead, I'll move my queen to put additional pressure on White's position.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

I apologize for the error. I made a mistake in reading the board position. Let me look at the board again and make a valid move.

Looking at the legal moves list, I see that my queen is actually on e5 (not e8 as I initially thought), and I don't have a move "e5e6" available. Let me select a proper move from the legal moves list.

Since my knight on e4 is giving check to the white king on d4, I should consider the best follow-up. From the legal moves, I can see options like e4f2 (knight fork) or e4c3 (maintaining an attack).

The knight fork with e4f2 looks particularly strong as it would attack both the king and potentially another piece while maintaining a strong central position.

My knight on f2 is very active and could potentially deliver a check. Looking at the legal moves, I notice I can play Nf2-d1, which would attack White's king on d4 with a discovered check from my queen on e8. This is a powerful tactic.

I'll make this move:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

I'll analyze the position as Black:

The board shows I have my king on g8, queen on e8, rook on g8, knight on d1, and several pawns. White has a king on d4, two bishops on a3 and a4, a knight on a8, and some pawns.

Looking at my options:
- My queen on e8 has many possible moves
- My knight on d1 can move to several squares
- I have pawn moves available

The most striking feature is that White's king is quite exposed on d4. This presents a tactical opportunity.

I'll use my knight on d1 to check the White king by moving to e3, which attacks both the king and potentially creates a fork with other pieces.

I'm playing as Black and have my king on e8, a queen on e5, a rook on g8, and a knight on e3. White's king is on d4, which is quite exposed.

Looking at my options, I notice my knight on e3 is in a powerful position and can potentially create threats. The move e3f5 (knight to f5) looks particularly strong as it:
1. Attacks White's king
2. Controls important central squares
3. Cannot be easily captured

This knight move would put significant pressure on White and limit their king's mobility.

The most critical aspect of this position is my knight on e3, which is well-placed and attacking the white king on d3. This creates a tactical opportunity.

I'll play the knight move e3c4, which attacks both the white king and the bishop on b5 simultaneously - a fork that will win material.

I need to address these threats while improving my position. My knight on f3 is well-placed and active, putting pressure on White's position.

Looking at my options, I think the most pressing concern is my king's safety. Moving my rook from g8 to f8 would strengthen my kingside defense and protect the f7 pawn that's currently under attack from White's bishop.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Looking at the position, I need to make a strategic decision as Black. 

I notice that:
- My king is on g8 with a rook on f8
- White has a knight on c7 threatening my queen on e8
- I have a knight on f3 that's actively placed
- White's king is on c3, somewhat exposed

Given the threats and opportunities, I'll move my queen to safety while maintaining control:

make_move e8e5

This move:
1. Gets my queen out of danger from the knight on c7
2. Places the queen on an active central square
3. Controls important central squares
4. Maintains pressure on White's position

One of the strongest moves appears to be attacking with my queen to create immediate threats. The move e5c3 looks particularly powerful as it attacks the white king's position with a discovered check from my knight on f3.

After analyzing the position, I see several good options. I notice my king is on h8 with a rook on f8, and I have a queen on c3 and a knight on f3 that both have many possible moves.

The position looks somewhat complex. I have an active queen on c3 that can potentially create threats. My knight on f3 is also well-placed with many options.

One strong move I see is to activate my queen with:

make_move c3e3

This centralizes my queen on the open e-file, putting pressure on White's position. It maintains flexibility and creates threats while keeping my queen active. This move increases my control of the center and could set up future tactical opportunities.

I notice my queen on e3 is very active and can potentially create threats. My king is in the corner with a rook protecting it. Let's use the queen to create pressure.

The move e3g5 looks strong - it attacks the g7 pawn while maintaining the queen's mobility and creating threats.

Looking at my options, I notice a powerful move: the queen can attack White's king and rook simultaneously with:

make_move d5d2

This creates a devastating fork between White's king on b2 and rook on c2. White cannot save both pieces, so I'll win material. This is a classic tactical opportunity that should give me a decisive advantage.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

After analyzing the position, I see that I'm playing as Black and have several strong options. 

I notice my queen on e2 is very active and my knight on f3 is well placed. I also have a rook on f8 that's currently defending the king on h8.

The most powerful move I see is to use my queen to check the white king on b2:

make_move e2b5

This move:
1. Puts the white king in check
2. Attacks from a safe distance
3. Controls important squares in White's position
4. Maintains my queen's mobility

This check will force White to respond, giving me initiative in the position.

2. White has a king on b2 and rook on c2
3. I have a rook on f8 and a knight on f3
4. There appears to be a potential threat from White's bishop on d4

Looking at my options, I notice I have a knight on f3 that's actively placed in the center. I should consider if there are any tactical opportunities with this knight or if I need to improve my king's safety.

The move f3g5 (knight from f3 to g5) looks good as it increases my knight's activity, controls important central squares, and maintains flexibility. This knight move develops my piece to a more active square while maintaining pressure in the center.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

I need to analyze the position carefully before making my move.

Looking at the board:
- I'm playing as Black with my king on g8
- White has a king on b2 and a rook on g1
- I have a rook on f8
- Material seems roughly equal, but I need to consider the best move

The most critical options appear to be:
1. King safety moves like h8g8 (king to the corner)
2. Rook moves along the back rank
3. Knight moves from g5
4. Pawn advances

The knight on g5 has some active options, particularly e6 which could be a strong outpost or potentially fork pieces. The f7-f5 advance could also gain space.

After evaluation, I believe the best move is to activate my knight:

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Looking at the position and my legal moves, I need to make a strategic decision.

I notice I'm playing as Black and the position appears to be in the middlegame with both kings castled. White has two bishops and a knight, while I have a knight and a rook. My king is on h8 with a rook on f8.

One of the strongest moves available is to centralize my rook with:

make_move f8e8

This move:
1. Centralizes my rook on the e-file
2. Maintains protection of the 8th rank
3. Increases my rook's mobility and influence
4. Prepares for potential counterplay in the center

The centralized rook will be more active and have greater influence over the position.

I need to analyze this position carefully. 

I see that I'm playing as Black with my king on h8, a rook on e8, and a knight on e6. White has a king on b2, bishops on d4 and b4, a knight on a6, and a rook on g7. There are various pawns for both sides.

Looking at my legal moves, I notice several key options:
- King moves (h8g8, e8g8, etc.) - Wait, there seems to be confusion here as my king appears to be on h8, not e8
- Knight moves from e6
- Various pawn moves

The most concerning element is White's rook on g7, which is putting pressure on my position. I should address this threat.

Based on the board position and my legal moves, I'll move my king away from the h-file to g8, which gives me more space and avoids potential threats along the h-file.

My king safety is important, and I notice my rook on e8 is defending the back rank. I should consider developing my pieces and improving my position.

Among my options:
- Knight moves from e6 could improve its position
- Pawn advances could gain space
- King moves, though generally I should be careful with king safety

The knight on e6 has several good options. Moving it to c5 would put pressure on White's position and develop it to a strong central square.

Looking at my options, I notice:
1. My rook on e8 is undefended and could be captured
2. My knight on c5 has several possible moves
3. I can make various pawn moves

The most pressing concern is my undefended rook. I should either move it to safety or defend it. Looking at the knight on c5, it can move to e6 which would both defend the rook and attack White's bishop on d4.

I'll make this move:

I need to analyze this position carefully as Black.

Looking at the board:
- I'm playing as Black with my king on g8
- White has a king on b2, a rook on d1, bishops on d8 and b4, and a knight on a6
- I have a rook on e8, a knight on e6, and several pawns

Key considerations:
1. My king's safety is paramount
2. The knight on e6 is well-positioned and active
3. My rook on e8 is defending the king

After evaluating the position, I'll make a move that improves my position while maintaining safety.

- My knight is on e6
- White has a king on b2, a knight on a6, a bishop on b4, and rooks on h1 and h8
- Pawn structure shows I have pawns on d7, f7, g7, h7, while White has pawns on a7 and h6

Key considerations:
1. My king's safety is important
2. The knight on e6 is well-placed in the center
3. I should look for active piece play

Among my options, moving the rook to f8 looks strong as it protects my king's position while creating a more active rook placement. This would defend the f7 pawn and potentially prepare for action on the f-file.

- White has a bishop on a8 and e5, a knight on a6, and a rook on h1
- White's king is on b2

The knight on f4 is well-positioned and has several good options. I should consider either improving my king's safety or using my knight to create threats.

I'll move my knight to e6, which controls important central squares, protects my pawn on d7, and creates potential threats.

Looking at the position strategically:
1. My knight on e6 is well-placed and has several good options
2. My rook on f8 is protecting the king but could be more active
3. I should consider improving my piece coordination

One strong move would be to activate my rook by moving it to the e-file, which would give me control of an open file and put pressure on White's position.

- White has a king on b2, bishops on e2 and g2, a rook on c1, and a knight on a6
- My knight on e6 is well-positioned in the center
- I should be mindful of my king's safety

Among my options, I notice I can improve my king's position by moving it to h8, which would be safer and out of potential checks from White's bishops.

I can see all my legal moves now. Let me analyze the position:

I'm playing as Black and have my king on h8 with a rook on e8. I notice I have a knight on e6 that's active, and my pawn structure is relatively intact. White has two bishops and a rook, with a knight on a6.

One of my strongest options is to castle kingside, which would be "e8g8" in UCI notation. This would connect my rooks and bring my king to safety. Since castling is generally a priority in the middlegame, and my king is still in the center, this looks like the best move.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

I need to analyze this position carefully as Black.

Looking at the board:
- I'm playing as Black with my king on g8 and a rook on h8
- White has two bishops (on f3 and g2), a knight on a6, and a rook on c1
- White's king is on a1
- There's a white pawn on h7 that's threatening to promote

Key considerations:
1. The white pawn on h7 is an immediate threat
2. My knight on e6 is active and could be useful
3. I need to ensure my king's safety

The most urgent issue is the white pawn on h7 which is one move away from promotion. I need to address this immediately.

The best move is to capture this pawn with my rook:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

I apologize for the error. Let me check the board again more carefully. It seems I misinterpreted the position. Let me look at the legal moves again and make a correct assessment.

From the legal moves list, I see options for my king (g8), knight (e6), and pawn moves. Let me analyze the position properly:

- My king is on g8 with a rook on h8
- White has a pawn on h7 that's threatening my position
- I need to make a strong move that addresses immediate threats

Looking at the legal moves, I should consider either a king move to safety or a knight move that improves my position.

After careful consideration, I'll move my king to f8, which gets out of the potential check from the h7 pawn and maintains control:

Looking at the position, I notice my knight on e6 is quite active and could potentially create threats. The move e6f4 looks particularly strong as it attacks White's bishop on g6 while also potentially setting up future tactics.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

I can see all my legal moves now. Let me analyze the position:

I'm playing as Black and have a rook on f8, king on g8, and knight on f4. White has a king on a1, rook on d1, bishops on f3 and h3, and a knight on a6.

The knight on f4 is well-positioned and could potentially fork pieces. I notice my king is on g8 with the rook on f8, so castling has already happened.

Looking at the available moves, I should consider:
1. Developing my knight to a better square
2. Improving my rook position
3. Advancing pawns to gain space

The knight on f4 has several good options. Moving it to g6 would protect my kingside pawns and maintain central influence. Moving to h5 could put pressure on White's position.

I'll make a move with my knight to g6, which protects my kingside pawns and maintains a strong central presence.

Looking at my options, I should prioritize king safety and piece coordination. The knight on g6 is well-placed, defending important squares. 

I'll move my king to g8, which maintains king safety while keeping my rook flexible.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

I need to analyze this position carefully as Black.

Looking at the board:
- I'm down material (White has a rook, two bishops, and a knight vs my rook and knight)
- My king is on g8 with the rook on f8
- White has a rook on d4 and bishops on e4 and h6
- White's king is on a1, far from my position

Key considerations:
1. My king's safety is paramount
2. I should look for any tactical opportunities
3. I need to activate my pieces if possible

Among my legal moves:
- Moving my king to h8 (g8h8) seems passive
- Moving my rook along the f-file gives me flexibility
- Knight moves like g6e5 could improve my piece position
- Pawn moves like f7f5 could gain space

I think the best move is to activate my rook by moving it to e8, which controls the e-file and maintains protection of my king's position.

You are a professional chess player and you play as black. Now is your turn to make a move. Before making a move you can pick one of the following actions:
- 'get_current_board' to get the schema and current status of the board
- 'get_legal_moves' to get a UCI formatted list of available moves
- 'make_move <UCI formatted move>' when you are ready to complete your turn (e.g., 'make_move e2e4')

Player_Black (to Proxy):

I can see the current position and my legal moves. Let me analyze the situation:

1. I'm playing as Black and my king is on g8
2. White has a rook on e1 and the white king is on a1
3. White has two bishops (on e4 and h6) and a knight on a6
4. I have a rook on e7, a knight on g6, and several pawns

Looking at the position, I notice my rook on e7 is under attack by White's bishop on e4. I should address this threat. I could:
1. Move the rook along the e-file
2. Capture with the rook (if possible)
3. Defend the rook

Among my legal moves, moving the rook to e5 seems strong as it attacks White's bishop while escaping the threat. This would put pressure on White's position.

My rook on e5 is very active and controls the e-file. I notice that White's king is on a1, and my rook could potentially deliver a check by moving to e1. This would be a strong move as it forces the White king to move and gives me the initiative.

2. My knight on g6 has several options
3. I have a pawn structure with pawns on d7, f7, g7, and h7
4. White has a bishop on h6 that can be captured by my g7 pawn

Looking at the position, I notice I can capture White's bishop on h6 with my g7 pawn, which seems like a good move as it removes one of White's active pieces. This capture would improve my position without obvious drawbacks.

The most forcing and advantageous move appears to be capturing the bishop on g2 with my rook, which would win material without immediate drawbacks.

- White has a knight on a6 and a bishop on f5

The most powerful move I see is to capture White's king with my rook, which would be checkmate:

2. White's bishop on f5 is targeting my h7 square but there's no immediate threat
3. White's knight on a6 is somewhat out of play
4. I should consider improving my position

One of the strongest moves available is to use my rook to control more of the board. Moving it to the first rank would put pressure on White's king.

Now I can see the board. I'm playing as Black, and I notice we're in an endgame position. I have a king on g8, pawns on d7, f7, g7, and h7, and a knight on g6. White has a king on c1, a bishop on b1, and a knight on a6.

Let me check what legal moves I have available.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Thank you for providing the legal moves. Let me analyze the position and make a decision:

I have several options as Black. Looking at the position:

1. My king can move to h8, f8, or g7
2. My knight on g6 has multiple options (h8, f8, e7, e5, h4, f4)
3. I can advance my pawns (f7-f6, d7-d6, h6-h5, f7-f5, d7-d5)

Given that we're in an endgame, I should focus on advancing my pawns to create passed pawns while maintaining control with my knight and king.

The move d7-d5 looks particularly strong as it advances a pawn two squares, gaining space and potentially creating a passed pawn. This would give me a significant advantage in the endgame.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

I see all my legal moves now. Let me analyze the position:

I'm playing as Black with my king on g8. White has a king on b2, a bishop on b1, and a knight on a6. I have pawns on f7, h6, and d5, plus a knight on g6.

Key considerations:
- My knight on g6 is active and has several good options
- My pawn structure is decent
- White's pieces are somewhat distant from my king

Looking at my best options:
1. Knight moves: My knight on g6 could improve its position with moves like g6e5 (centralization) or g6f4 (attacking central squares)
2. Pawn advances: f7f5 would claim space and could support my knight
3. King moves: I could improve my king's position with g8f8

After evaluation, I think centralizing my knight is the strongest move.

After analyzing the position and my available legal moves, I'll make a decision.

I notice that my king is on g8, and I have several good developing options. One strong move is to develop my bishop on e7 to a more active square. The bishop can go to d6, c5, b4, or even a3. Among these, c5 looks particularly good as it controls important central squares and puts pressure on White's position.

I'll analyze the position and make a strategic move.

Looking at the board, I notice:
- The position appears to be in the early middlegame
- I have two bishops and two knights developed
- White has a queen on c2 and a knight on h4
- I need to continue development and improve my position

Among my options, I see several strong candidate moves:
- Castle kingside with g8h8 to secure my king
- Develop my rook with f8e8
- Continue developing with moves like d7d6 or d7d5

Castling is a priority in the opening/early middlegame for king safety, so I'll castle kingside.

One strong move is to develop my rook to e8, which would connect my rooks and prepare for central play. This is a solid developing move that improves my position.

2. My dark-squared bishop on c5 is active and threatening the white kingside.
3. I have knights on c6 and f6 that could be developed further.

The kingside castle looks particularly appealing as it would immediately improve my king's safety and connect my rooks. This is typically a priority in the middlegame.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

I need to analyze the position carefully before making my move.

Looking at the board, I notice:
- I'm playing as Black
- White has a bishop on g4 threatening my queen
- White has a knight on h4 that could be dangerous
- My king is on g8 without much protection
- I have two bishops (c5 and c6) and two knights (c6 and f6) developed

One of my most pressing concerns is the bishop on g4 attacking my queen. I should address this threat immediately. I could move my queen to e8 or f8, but I prefer to keep my queen active.

Another good option is to develop my rook by moving it to f8, which would connect my rooks and prepare for potential kingside play.

After considering my options, I'll move my king to f8, which gets it out of the back rank, avoids any potential discovered attacks, and makes room for connecting my rooks later.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

After analyzing the position, I can see several key features:

1. I'm playing as Black and have a bishop pair (c5 and c6)
2. White has a knight on h4 that could potentially become active
3. My king is on g8 with the rook on f8, suggesting I could castle kingside
4. White has a bishop on f6 that's putting pressure on my position

Looking at my options, I think castling kingside would be a good move to improve my king's safety. This connects my rooks and gets my king to a safer position.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

I'll analyze the position and my available moves:

The position shows I'm playing as Black with material roughly equal. White has a queen on c2 and has developed pieces, including a bishop on f6 that's attacking my position.

Key observations:
- My king on g8 is somewhat exposed with the white bishop on f6 creating pressure
- I have two bishops (c5 and c6) and a knight (c6) developed
- My e5 pawn is advanced but could be vulnerable

Among my best options:
1. Developing my rook with g8f8 or g8e8
2. Protecting my king with h7h6 to push away the bishop
3. Moving my bishop on c5 to safer squares or with tactical purpose

After evaluation, I'll make a move:

2. White has a strong queen on c2 and a bishop on f6
3. My king is on g8 with some pawn weaknesses around it

Among my options, I notice I can develop my queen to a more active position with Qd8e7, which would:
- Connect my rooks
- Protect my knight on c6
- Prepare to castle queenside if needed
- Move my queen away from the d-file where it could face pressure

After analyzing the position, I notice several key aspects:

1. White has a bishop on e7 attacking my king
2. I need to address this check immediately
3. I have several options to deal with the check:
   - Move my king (g8f8, g8e8, g8d8)
   - Block with my knight (c6e7)
   - Block with my bishop (c5e7)
   - Capture the bishop with a pawn (f7xe7)

Looking at these options, capturing the bishop with my pawn seems strongest as it eliminates the threat while gaining material. The move f7xe7 would be best.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Looking at the available moves, I have several good options against the Grob Opening. The most principled response is to attack the advanced g4 pawn with 1...h5, challenging White's center control immediately.

This move puts pressure on White's structure and can lead to early tactical opportunities if White isn't careful. It's a strong counter to the somewhat dubious g4 opening.

Looking at the position and my legal moves, I need to respond to White's early kingside play. White has played g4 and Nf3, which is somewhat unusual.

Since White has advanced the g-pawn, I can capture it with my h-pawn, which would disrupt White's pawn structure. This is generally a good principle - when your opponent makes pawn moves on the wing, it's often advantageous to capture and open lines.

I can see the current position. White has played a knight to e5, and it appears Black has pushed the g-pawn to g4, and there's a white pawn on h3. Let me check what legal moves I have available.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

After analyzing the position and the legal moves, I see that White has a knight on e5 that's attacking my position. I have several good options:

1. I can capture the knight with my own knight: c6xe5
2. I can push pawns to challenge the center
3. I can develop my pieces

The most immediate opportunity is capturing the undefended knight on e5, which would win material.

Let me check what legal moves I have available.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Now I have a clear picture of the position and my available moves. 

Looking at the position, I notice my knight on e5 is well-placed in the center. I should consider developing more pieces and continuing with my kingside development. The knight on g8 could be developed, or I could push central pawns to establish presence in the center.

One strong move would be to develop with e7-e6, which opens up the bishop on f8 and helps control the center. This is a solid classical development move that supports my knight on e5.

I'll make this move:

After analyzing the position and my available legal moves, I'll make a decision.

I notice I'm in the early opening phase with a knight already developed to c4. My king is still in the center, and I should prioritize development and king safety.

One of the strongest moves here would be to develop my dark-squared bishop with Bf8-e7, which helps protect my kingside and prepares for castling. This is a natural developing move that follows opening principles.

After analyzing the position and available moves, I notice a few key elements:

1. I have a knight on e3 that's actively placed in White's territory
2. White has a rook on d4 that could be targeted
3. My bishop on e7 is currently pinned to my king by White's rook on d4

One strong move stands out - I can attack White's rook with my knight:

After analyzing the position and available moves, I can see that:

1. White has a rook on d4 that's attacking my position
2. I have a knight on f6 and another knight on f2 (which appears to be deep in White's territory)
3. My king is on f8 with some pieces around it

The knight on f2 is particularly interesting as it's a fork position threatening White's queen on d1 and rook on h1. This is a powerful tactical opportunity.

I'll capture White's queen with my knight:

I need to address the immediate threat of the rook on d7. I have several options, but the most direct is to capture the rook.

Looking at the legal moves, I can see that I can capture the rook with either my queen (d8d7) or my bishop (c8d7). The queen capture would be stronger, maintaining my most powerful piece while eliminating the threat.

After analyzing the position and legal moves, I see several good options. I notice my knights are well-positioned, and I have pressure in the center.

One strong move is to develop my rook to g8, connecting my rooks and preparing for potential action on the g-file. This is a solid developing move that improves my piece coordination.

I notice my king is on g8 with a rook on h8, and I have knights on e5 and f6. White has a bishop on f4 that's attacking my e5 knight. I should address this threat.

Looking at the available moves, I'll play the knight from e5 to c4, which moves it away from the bishop's attack while also putting pressure on White's position. This knight move creates threats against White's pawn structure and improves my piece activity.

After analyzing the position, I can see I'm playing as Black with a relatively developed position. I notice my knight on f6 is under attack by White's bishop on f4, so I should consider addressing that threat.

Looking at the available moves, I have several good options:

1. I could move the knight to safety with f6e4 or f6d5
2. I could protect the knight with e6f5
3. I could develop my rook with h8h7 or h8h6
4. I could advance my bishop with e7d6 or e7c5

The knight move to e4 (f6e4) looks particularly strong as it attacks White's pawn on f2 while moving to a central square. This is a typical knight outpost that controls important central squares.

- Occupy a strong central outpost

After analyzing the position, I can see several interesting options. I notice my knight on e3 has some good moves, and my bishop on c5 is also active. 

Looking at the position more carefully, I see that my knight on e3 can fork the white king on e1 and the bishop on g4 by moving to f1. This would be a strong tactical move.

3. I have a bishop on c5 that's actively placed
4. White has a bishop on e4 that could be targeted

One strong move I see is to attack White's bishop on e4 with my knight:

One of the strongest moves appears to be moving my knight from f1 to d2, which maintains the check on the White king while also attacking the rook on b1.

Looking at the position more carefully, I see a strong tactical opportunity: my bishop on c5 is targeting the f2 square, which could lead to a powerful attack.

I'll play:

make_move c5f2

This move attacks White's king directly. The bishop sacrifice on f2 should create a strong attack, as the white king will be exposed after capturing. If White takes the bishop with the king, I can follow up with queen checks and potentially a strong attack with my knights joining in.

After analyzing the position, I see several promising options. I notice I have a bishop on f2 that's attacking the white king on f1, but it's not a direct check. I also have two knights and a queen that could be developed more actively.

Looking at the position, I see an opportunity to create a strong attack with my queen. Moving the queen to g5 would create multiple threats and increase pressure on White's position.

I also see I have knights on g5 and c3 that could be developed to better squares. The knight on g5 is particularly well placed, putting pressure on the kingside.

Looking at the position strategically, I'll play:

make_move f2e1

This move maintains my bishop on a powerful diagonal, continues to restrict the white king's movement, and threatens to capture the rook on b2 in the future. This is a strong diagonal for my bishop and keeps pressure on White's position.

After analyzing the position and my available moves, I notice I have a bishop on e1 that's attacking the white king on g3. This is a check situation, and I should capitalize on it.

Looking at my options, I can either capture something valuable or increase the pressure on the white king. The knight on c3 has some good outposts, and the bishop on e1 is delivering check.

I'll play the bishop check from e1 to g3, which forces the white king to move and gives me a material advantage.

One of my strongest moves appears to be the knight fork with c3e4, which would attack both White's rook on e5 and potentially another piece.

After analyzing the position, I see several good options. I notice my king is on g8 with a rook on h8, and White has a rook on b5 that's attacking my b-pawn. I also have knights on c5 and g5 that could be developed.

One strong move would be to protect my b7 pawn which is under attack by the white rook on b5. I can do this by moving my a7 pawn forward.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Let me analyze the position:

I'm playing as Black and the position looks complex. White has a rook on b4 that's attacking my pawn on b7. My king is on g8 with a rook on h8. I have knights on c5 and g5, and a bishop on c8.

Looking at the legal moves, I need to consider:
1. Any immediate threats from White
2. Potential tactical opportunities
3. Improving my piece positions

The rook on b4 is threatening my b7 pawn. I could defend it with c7-c6, but that would block my bishop on c8. 

My knight on g5 has some interesting options, particularly g5-e4 which would attack the center and potentially fork pieces.

After careful consideration, I'll play the knight to e4, which looks like a strong central square and could create threats.

2. White has a rook on b5 that's attacking my b7 pawn
3. I have a knight on c5 that could be developed further
4. My bishop on c8 could be developed

Among my options, I should prioritize addressing the threat to my b7 pawn while improving my position. The knight on c5 is well-placed and could potentially move to e4 to increase pressure in the center.

I'll defend the b7 pawn by moving my rook from h8 to h7, which maintains protection of my kingside while addressing the immediate threat.

One of my strongest moves appears to be moving my rook on h4 to e4, which would attack White's pawn on e5 and increase my control of the center. This also creates potential threats against White's king position.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

After analyzing the position, I can see that I'm playing as Black with a material advantage (a rook, bishop, knight, and several pawns against White's lone rook). My king is on g8, and I need to make a good move.

Looking at the legal moves, I notice a few key options:
- I could move my bishop on e6 to various squares
- I could develop my knight on c5
- I could make pawn moves

Since White has a rook on a4 that could potentially become active, I should consider addressing that threat. My bishop on e6 can move to a2, which would pin the rook against the edge of the board.

I'll analyze the position:

I'm playing as Black and have several pieces: a king on g8, a rook on b8, a knight on c5, a bishop on a2, and pawns on b7, c7, f7, and g7. White has a rook on a8, a king on f1, and a pawn on b6.

Looking at my options:
- My bishop on a2 is active and can move to several squares
- My knight on c5 is centralized and has multiple options
- My rook on b8 can move along the 8th rank
- My king is safe for now

The most pressing issue is the White rook on a8 threatening my rook on b8. I should address this threat.

I'll move my rook to capture White's rook:

Thank you for providing the legal moves. Now I can make an informed decision.

Looking at the position, I notice I have several strong pieces - a rook on a8, a knight on e5 (though it appears to be on e4 based on the legal moves), and a bishop on a7 (though it appears to be on a2 based on the legal moves).

One of the strongest moves I see is to use my bishop to attack along the diagonal. The move a2e6 would place my bishop on an excellent diagonal, controlling important central squares and potentially creating threats.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

I need to analyze the position carefully before making my move.

Looking at the board, I see I'm playing as Black with:
- A king on g8
- A rook on a8
- A bishop on e6
- A knight on e4
- Pawns on b7, c7, f7, and g7
- White has a king on f1 and a pawn on b2

The position appears to be favorable for Black as I have more pieces. Let me consider my best options:

1. The knight on e4 is well-positioned and can attack several squares. Moving it to f6 or c5 would maintain its central influence.
2. The bishop on e6 is active and controls important diagonals.
3. My rook on a8 could be developed to an open file.

I think one of the strongest moves is to activate my rook by moving it to the f-file, putting pressure on White's position.

I need to analyze this position carefully. I'm playing as Black and have several pieces: a king on g8, a rook on f8, a knight on f6, a bishop on g4, and pawns on b7, g7, and f7.

Looking at the position and legal moves:

1. My king is on g8 and can move to h7 or h8
2. My rook on f8 can move along the f-file or to the 8th rank
3. My knight on f6 has several options
4. My bishop on g4 has diagonal moves
5. I have pawn moves available

The White king is on f1, and there's a White pawn on c7 that's advanced.

Given this endgame position with material advantage, I should look for a strong move. The bishop on g4 has good diagonal control, and I notice it can move to e6, which would put pressure on the center and potentially create threats.

I need to analyze this position carefully. I'm playing as Black and I see:

- White has a queen on c8
- I have my king on g8, a rook on f8, a bishop on e6, a knight on f6, and pawns on b7, f7, and g7
- White's king is on f1

The most pressing issue is that White's queen on c8 is attacking my position. I need to consider safety and potential counterplay.

Looking at my options:
1. Moving my king to h7 or h8
2. Moving my rook to defend or attack
3. Using my knight or bishop for counterplay

The safest and strongest move appears to be moving my rook to e8, creating a threat against White's position while maintaining defense.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

After analyzing the position and my legal moves, I can see I'm playing as Black with my king on g8. White has a queen on c7 which is creating pressure. I have a rook on e8, a bishop on e6, and a knight on f6.

The most critical issue is that my king is potentially vulnerable. I need to ensure its safety while maintaining my active pieces.

Looking at the options:
- Moving my king to h8 would be safer, away from potential checks
- The bishop on e6 and knight on f6 are well-positioned and active
- My rook on e8 is protecting the e-file

I'll move my king to h8, which is a prophylactic move that improves my king's safety.

Looking at my legal moves, I notice I can castle kingside with "e8g8". This would be a strong move as it brings my king to safety and connects my rooks. Castling is particularly valuable in this position.

I need to be careful about the white queen on e5 which is attacking my position. Let me consider my best options:

1. The knight on f6 is pinned by the queen to my king, so moving it would expose my king to check.
2. Moving my bishop could be good to develop a counterattack.
3. I should consider king safety first.

The most prudent move is to get my king to safety by moving it away from the g-file:

Looking at the legal moves, I need to consider both defensive and active options. The queen on d6 is a threat, but I also want to improve my position if possible.

After evaluation, I believe the best move is to protect my king by moving the rook to g8, which maintains defensive coverage while keeping my pieces coordinated.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Thank you for providing the legal moves. Let me analyze the position and make the best move.

I notice that White's queen on d6 is threatening my bishop on e6 and potentially creating other threats. My priority is to ensure my king's safety and maintain my material advantage.

Looking at the available moves, I see several key options:
1. I could move my king to safety
2. I could move my bishop to avoid capture
3. I could develop my rook or advance pawns

The most pressing concern is my bishop on e6 being under attack by White's queen. Moving it would be prudent. Among the bishop moves, I should look for one that maintains control of important squares while moving to safety.

I'll move my bishop to f5, which moves it away from the queen's attack while maintaining influence on the center and diagonal.

You are a professional chess player and you play as black. Now is your turn to make a move. Before making a move you can pick one of the following actions:
- 'get_current_board' to get the schema and current status of the board
- 'get_legal_moves' to get a UCI formatted list of available moves
- 'make_move <UCI formatted move>' when you are ready to complete your turn (e.g., 'make_move e2e4')

Now I can see the board position. I'm playing as Black and I notice that:
- I have my king on g8, a rook on g7, pawns on b7, f7, and g6
- I also have a bishop on e5 and a knight on f6
- White has a queen on a6 and the king on d2

Let me check my legal moves to make the best decision.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Thank you for providing the legal moves. Let me analyze the position and make the best move.

I notice several important factors:
- White's queen is on a6, threatening my b7 pawn
- My king is on g8 with the rook on g7
- I have a bishop on e5 and knight on f6 that could be developed better

Looking at my options, I need to address the immediate threat to my b7 pawn while improving my position. The queen on a6 is a significant threat.

I'll defend the b7 pawn by moving:

make_move b7b6

This defends against the queen's attack on b7 and maintains control of important squares. It's a solid defensive move that addresses the immediate threat while allowing me to continue developing my position in future moves.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Looking at the position, I need to make a careful assessment:

1. I'm playing as Black with my king on g8 and a rook on h8
2. White has a queen on a6 and king on e1
3. I have several pieces: bishop on e6, knight on f6, and pawns on b6, f7, and g7
4. The position appears to be in the middlegame/endgame phase

My priority should be king safety and piece coordination. The white queen on a6 is potentially threatening my queenside. 

After analyzing the legal moves, I'll protect my king by moving the rook to h7, which maintains my defensive structure and keeps the rook active.

Now I have a clear picture of the position and my available moves. Let me analyze the situation:

1. I notice White's queen is on a8, which is directly attacking my rook on g8 along the back rank.
2. My king is on h7, and I need to ensure its safety.
3. I have several pieces that can develop or improve their positions.

Looking at my options, I see a few key considerations:
- I could capture the queen with Ra8, but I should check if that's safe
- I could move my rook to another square on the back rank
- I could develop my pieces or improve my king's safety

Since the queen is on a8 and my rook is on g8, I can capture the queen, which appears to be a free piece.

I see the position now. I'm playing as Black with a king on g8, a rook on e8, a bishop on e6, a knight on f6, and pawns on b6, f7, g7, and h7. White's king is on e1.

Looking at my legal moves, I have several strong options. Since I have a significant material advantage, I should aim for a decisive attack or to simplify into a winning endgame.

The rook on e8 is directly attacking White's king on e1, which is a powerful threat. I'll capitalize on this by making the move:

Player_Black (to Proxy):

I apologize for the error. It seems I misread the board position. Let me look at the board again more carefully.

The White king is on e1, but my rook on e8 cannot directly attack it as there are many squares in between. Let me select a better move from my legal options.

Given my material advantage (rook, bishop, knight, and several pawns against just a king), I should organize my pieces for a coordinated attack. A good approach would be to advance my rook to control more of the board.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

I need to analyze this position carefully. I'm playing as Black and have several pieces: a king on g8, a rook on f8, a bishop on e6, a knight on f6, and pawns on b6, f7, g7, and h7. White's king is on e5.

Looking at the legal moves, I have several strong options:

1. I could consider a check with the bishop: e6g4 would put White's king in check.
2. I could also check with the knight: f6g4 or f6d5 would both deliver check.
3. Moving my rook along the back rank could be useful for controlling space.

Given that I have a material advantage and White's king is exposed, I'll play a move that puts immediate pressure on the White king.

Looking at the legal moves, I'll play the bishop move g4e2, which delivers checkmate by controlling the escape squares around the White king on f2.

After analyzing the position and my legal moves, I can see I have several good options. I have a bishop on e2 that's attacking the white king on e5, which is a key tactical element.

Looking at the position, I notice my bishop on e2 is putting the white king in check. I should capitalize on this advantage. The most direct way to improve my position while maintaining the check is to move my bishop to another diagonal that still attacks the king.

After analyzing the position and my legal moves, I can see that I have a significant material advantage with a rook, bishop, knight, and several pawns against just White's king. This is a winning position for me.

I'll make a strong move with my rook to the h-file, which will help control more space and prepare for a checkmate.

Looking at my options, I should focus on improving my position and potentially preparing for a checkmate against the White king on f1.

I'll move my bishop to improve its position and control more of the board:

make_move e6c4

This diagonal move puts my bishop on a strong square, controlling important central squares and adding pressure toward White's position. It also maintains protection of my knight on f6 while opening up potential future tactics.

Looking at the position, I notice I can deliver checkmate immediately. The White king is on f2, and my bishop on c5 controls the e3 and d4 squares. If I move my knight from f6 to e4, it will be a checkmate as the White king on f2 will have no legal moves:
- The knight on e4 controls f2
- The bishop on c5 controls d4 and e3
- The king can't move to g3 or g2 as those squares don't exist on the board

I'll make this move:

Thank you for providing the legal moves. I can now analyze the position and make a decision.

Looking at the position, I notice I have a bishop on c5 (though it appears as c4 in the legal moves list), a rook on h8, and my king on g8. I should consider my best options.

Some key observations:
- The white king is on f2, quite exposed
- My bishop on c4/c5 has good diagonals and could potentially check the king
- I should look for active moves that improve my position

Among the available moves, the bishop move c4e2 stands out as it attacks the white king directly, giving check. This is a strong move that forces the white king to respond and gives me the initiative.

The most powerful move appears to be:

make_move e2f3

This move maintains the check on the white king while controlling important squares. The bishop on f3 restricts the white king's movement and maintains strong pressure.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

I notice there's some confusion in the legal moves list - it includes moves for the white king (e4), but I'm playing as Black.

Looking at the position, I have several strong options:
1. The bishop on e5 is attacking the white king on e4, which appears to be a check
2. I can move my rook along the h-file or 8th rank
3. I can advance my pawns

Since the bishop is already giving check, I should consider how to maximize my advantage. The best move is to support the bishop with my rook by moving it to e8, creating a powerful battery against the white king.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

I see the position now. I'm playing as Black with a rook on e8, a bishop on e4, and my king on g8. White's king is on d4.

Looking at my options, I notice I have a powerful bishop on e4 that's controlling several diagonals. I can deliver a check to the white king with my bishop.

The move Bf5+ (e4f5 in UCI notation) would check the white king and also control important squares. This is a strong move that puts pressure on White.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

After analyzing the position and my available moves, I see several strong options:

1. I could play my rook along the e-file to attack White's king, particularly e8e4+ which would give check.
2. I could move my bishop to create threats or protect key squares.
3. I could advance my pawns to create space or prepare for promotion.

The most decisive move appears to be checking the White king with my rook:

Now I can see all my legal moves. Let me analyze the position:

I have a material advantage with a rook and bishop against no pieces for White except the king. The position looks winning for me (Black). My goal should be to use my pieces effectively to checkmate White's king.

Looking at the board, I notice that my rook on e4 (which appears as e5 in the visual representation) can deliver check by moving to e6, attacking White's king on d6.

This is a strong move as it puts immediate pressure on the white king and restricts its movement.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Thank you for providing the legal moves. Now I can analyze the position and make a strong move.

Looking at the position, I notice several key factors:
1. I have a material advantage with a rook and bishop against just the white king
2. The white king is on d4
3. I should aim to coordinate my pieces to force checkmate

One of the strongest moves here would be to use my rook to control the 5th rank and restrict the white king's movement. Moving the rook to e4 would put pressure on the white king and create a strong attacking position.

I need to analyze this position carefully. I'm playing as Black and have several pieces: a king on g8, pawns on b6, f7, and g7, a bishop on f5, and a rook on e4. White has a king on c7.

Looking at the legal moves, I notice I have a powerful rook on e4 that controls the e-file. Since White's king is on c7, I can deliver a check by moving my rook to e7.

This check would be strong because:
1. It forces White's king to move
2. It controls more of the board
3. It brings my rook closer to White's king for potential mating patterns

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Looking at the legal moves and the board position, I notice there's a discrepancy. The board shows a pawn on b7, but the legal moves include b6b5, suggesting a pawn on b6. Also, the legal moves include h7h8, h7g8, etc., suggesting a piece on h7 that isn't shown on the board.

Nevertheless, I'll work with the legal moves provided. Since I'm playing as Black, my goal is to promote my pawns safely while keeping White's king in check or restricted.

The bishop on e6 controls important diagonals and can help support pawn advancement. I'll advance my b-pawn which appears to be on b6 according to the legal moves.

Looking at the legal moves, I notice I can deliver checkmate immediately with the bishop. The move e6c8 would be checkmate as the White king on e8 would be attacked by my bishop with no legal moves.

1. I notice White's king is on e7 and there are pawns on f7 and g7 that appear to be White's pawns.
2. I have a bishop on c8 that has several diagonal moves available.
3. My king is on g8, and I have some pawn moves available.

The most critical observation is that White's king is on e7, and my bishop on c8 can attack it by moving to e6. This would put White's king in check and potentially win material or gain a significant advantage.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Now I can see all my legal moves. Let me analyze the position:

I have a bishop on e5 (shown as e6 in the legal moves) and my king on g7, with pawns on f7, g7, and b5. The white king is on d6.

Looking at the position strategically:
1. My bishop is very active on e5, controlling important diagonals
2. I should consider how to best use my bishop advantage
3. I need to keep my king safe while potentially advancing my pawns

Among my options:
- I could move my bishop to various squares (e6c8, e6d7, e6f5, etc.)
- I could advance my pawns (f7f5, f7f6, b5b4, etc.)
- I could move my king (g7g6, g7g8, etc.)

The most promising move appears to be advancing my f-pawn to f5, creating more space and potentially setting up a passed pawn situation. This maintains my bishop's activity while improving my pawn structure.

Thank you for providing the legal moves. Let me analyze the position:

I see I have a bishop on e6 (not e5 as I initially thought), a king on h7, and pawns on b5, f5, and g7.

Looking at the available moves, I need to consider:
1. King safety - my king on h7 has several possible moves
2. Bishop mobility - my bishop on e6 has many diagonal options
3. Pawn advancement - I can advance any of my pawns

Since the white king is on e5, I should consider using my bishop to control important squares while keeping it safe. The move e6d5 would put my bishop in a strong position, attacking the white king directly while being protected by my pawn on f5.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

I need to analyze this endgame position carefully.

I see that I'm playing as Black with my king on g8, and I have pawns on b5, f5, and g7. White has a king on d4.

Key considerations:
1. My g7 pawn is closest to promotion
2. I need to be careful about king opposition and zugzwang
3. I should try to advance my pawns while keeping my king active

Looking at my options, advancing my g-pawn seems most promising as it's closest to queening. Moving g7-g5 would advance it two squares at once, which accelerates my promotion chances.

Now I understand my available moves. Let me analyze the position:

I have my king on g8 and three pawns on b5, f5, and g5. The White king is on d4.

My goal should be to advance one of my pawns to promote it to a queen while keeping my king safe. Looking at the legal moves:

1. The f5 and g5 pawns are closer to promotion and can advance.
2. The White king is on d4, which is not directly threatening my pawns yet.
3. I should try to create a passed pawn that can promote quickly.

The f5 pawn is a good candidate to advance since it's already on the 5th rank and can potentially promote faster than the b5 pawn. Moving it to f4 will also keep it safe from the White king for now.

Based on the legal moves provided, my king must be at h7, and I have options to move it to various squares. I also have pawn moves available.

Since my king appears to be exposed, I should prioritize king safety. Moving to g7 keeps my king protected while maintaining flexibility.

I see the position now. This is an endgame with just kings and a few pawns. I'm playing as Black with my king on g6, and I have pawns on b5, g5, and f5. White's king is on c6.

Let me check what legal moves I have available.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Now I can see all my legal moves. Let's analyze the position:

1. I have three pawns (b5, g5, f3) versus White's king on c6
2. My king is on g7
3. The most advanced pawn is my f3 pawn, which is closest to promotion

The best strategy here is to advance my most promising pawn toward promotion. The f3 pawn is already on the 3rd rank and has a clear path to promotion.

I'll advance my f-pawn:

I see my legal moves now. This is a winning position for Black with a queen against a lone king. My goal should be to efficiently checkmate White's king.

Looking at the position, I can deliver checkmate immediately with my queen by playing Qf1-f8#. This move places the queen on f8, which puts the white king in check with no legal escape squares.

I see that White has made the first move g2g3, playing 1.g3 (moving the g-pawn forward one square). This is a hypermodern opening approach that aims to control the center with pieces rather than pawns, and prepares for a fianchetto of the king's bishop.

Let me check my legal moves to respond.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Now I can see all my legal moves. As a professional chess player, I'll analyze the position and make a strong response.

Against White's 1.g3, I'll play a solid classical approach. One of the strongest responses is to take control of the center with a pawn move. The move 1...e5 is particularly good here as it stakes a claim in the center and opens lines for my bishop and queen.

Looking at the position and available moves, I'll develop my knight to a natural square.

The position is an open game after 1.e4 e5, and White has also played g3, likely planning a fianchetto with Bg2. As Black, I want to develop my pieces and control the center.

Knight development to f6 is a standard move in open positions, putting pressure on e4 and developing a piece to a good square.

After analyzing the position, I see several good options. Since White has played e4 and g3, I should continue with my development. The knight on f6 is already well-placed, controlling the e4 square.

I'll develop my knight on b8 to c6, which is a natural developing move that supports my e5 pawn and prepares for potential central play. This follows good opening principles by developing pieces toward the center and increasing my control of the central squares.

1. Bring my king to safety
2. Connect my rooks
3. Develop my h8 rook to the center

This is particularly important since White already has an active bishop on a6 and could be preparing an attack. Castling is a priority in the opening/early middlegame when possible.

You are a professional chess player and you play as black. Now is your turn to make a move. Before making a move you can pick one of the following actions:

- 'get_legal_moves' to get a UCI formatted list of available moves
- 'make_move <UCI formatted move>' when you are ready to complete your turn (e.g., 'make_move e2e4')

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

After analyzing the position, I can see I'm playing as Black and have several options. The position shows White has advanced a pawn to e5 and g3, while I have knights on c6 and f6, bishops on e7 and c8, and my king is castled kingside.

I notice my e-pawn is under attack by White's e5 pawn. I should consider either defending it or creating counterplay.

One strong move would be to play Nf6xe4, capturing White's advanced e-pawn. This would win a pawn while developing my knight to a more central position.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

I need to analyze the position carefully. I see that:

1. I'm playing as Black and have a knight on e4 that's quite advanced
2. White has a bishop on a3 that's attacking my queenside
3. My king is on g8 with a rook on f8
4. I have a bishop on e7 that could be developed

Looking at my options, I should prioritize development and king safety. The knight on e4 is strong but potentially vulnerable. I could consider:

1. Castling with g8h8 to secure my king
2. Developing my bishop with e7f6 or e7d6
3. Moving my knight on e4 to a safer square if threatened

Since I already have a knight on e4 in an advanced position, I should focus on completing development and securing my king. Castling kingside is a natural move here.

The knight on e4 is particularly strong, centralized and putting pressure on White's position. I could consider moves like Nxf2+ which would fork the king and rook, winning material.

I'll make this tactical move:

The most immediate tactical opportunity is to capture White's queen with my knight: f2d1. This would win a queen for a knight, which is a significant material advantage.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

After analyzing the position and available moves, I can see I'm playing as Black in what appears to be a complex middlegame position. I notice:

- My king is on e8 with castling still possible
- I have knights on c6 and e3, with the e3 knight being particularly active
- White has a bishop on b4 that's attacking my queenside
- My pawn structure is mostly intact

The knight on e3 is very well placed and putting pressure on White's position. I should consider either improving my king's safety by castling or continuing to develop my pieces.

I'll castle kingside to improve my king's safety:

Player_Black (to Proxy):

I need to analyze the position carefully before making my move.

Looking at the board, I notice:
- I have two knights developed (c6 and e3)
- My dark-squared bishop is on e7
- My light-squared bishop is on c8
- White has a bishop on c4 that could be threatening my position
- My king is still in the center (e8)

Given the middle game position, I should prioritize king safety and piece development. Castling kingside would be a good move to secure my king.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

I apologize for the confusion. Looking at the board again, I notice that my king is already on g8 (the bottom right corner from Black's perspective). This means I've already castled kingside.

Let me choose another strong move. The knight on e3 is well-placed and putting pressure on White's position. I'll develop my light-squared bishop from c8.

I can see all my legal moves now. Since White has played 1.f3, which weakens White's kingside, I'll respond with 1...e5. This is a strong move that:

1. Controls the center
2. Opens lines for my bishop and queen
3. Takes advantage of White's somewhat weakened kingside

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Looking at the position, I need to respond to White's early kingside pawn advances (f4 and g4). This gives me an opportunity to establish a strong central presence.

Among my options, I see that developing pieces and controlling the center would be most principled. The move Nf6 (g8f6) is particularly appealing as it develops a knight to a strong square, controls important central squares (e4 and d5), and prepares for potential kingside castling.

After analyzing the position, I see several good options. Since White has weakened their kingside with those pawn pushes, I should consider developing my pieces actively and potentially preparing to castle kingside.

One of the strongest moves here is developing my knight to c6, which develops a piece, controls the center, and prepares for castling. This is a natural developing move that follows opening principles.

I see all my legal moves now. Looking at the position, I notice I have the opportunity to castle kingside (e8g8), which is often a good move to improve king safety and connect my rooks.

The position shows that:
1. My king is still in the center
2. The kingside is clear for castling
3. White's king is already castled on the kingside
4. Castling would improve my king's safety and connect my rooks

This is a standard development move that will improve my position significantly.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

I'll analyze the position as Black:

The position appears to be in the middle game with both kings castled. I notice my king is on g8 with a missing bishop on f8, while White's king is on f1. I have knights on c6 and f6, and bishops on e7 and c8. There's a pawn on e5 that could be advanced.

Looking at the legal moves, I should consider:
- Developing my rook on a8 or completing castling
- Improving my knight positions
- Advancing central pawns

I think completing the kingside castle is a good idea for king safety.

I'll move my king from g8 to f8, which is the first step toward queenside castling and improves my king's position.

I notice White's queen is on a5, which is quite active. My king's position seems relatively safe, but I should consider improving my development and potentially creating counterplay.

Among my options:
- I could develop my bishop with e7d6 or e7c5
- I could advance my e-pawn with e5e4
- I could develop my knight with c6d4 or f6e4
- I could castle kingside with h8g8 or f8g8

The move e5e4 looks particularly appealing as it challenges White's central control and opens lines for my pieces. This pawn advance puts pressure on White's position and improves my space advantage.

The position appears to be in the middle game with both kings castled. White has a queen on a5, and I need to consider both defensive needs and potential counterplay.

Looking at the legal moves, I notice:
- My king is on g8 and appears safe
- I have two knights (c6 and f6) that could be developed
- There's a bishop on e7 that could be activated
- My e5 pawn is advanced and potentially vulnerable

One strong move would be to develop my knight to e5 with c6e5, which:
- Centralizes the knight to a strong outpost
- Puts pressure on White's position
- Improves my piece activity

I'll make this move:

Player_Black (to Proxy):

I need to analyze the position carefully before making my move.

Looking at the board, I notice:
- White has a queen on a5 and a bishop on e5
- My king is on g8 with a rook on f8
- I have knights on f6 and e5
- There's a pawn tension at e5/f4

The knight on e5 is particularly strong, controlling key squares. I also need to be mindful of potential threats from White's queen.

One strong move would be to play Nf6-d5, which:
1. Centralizes my knight
2. Attacks White's c-pawn
3. Defends my e7 bishop
4. Maintains control of key central squares

I'll make this move:

I can see this is a complex middlegame position. As Black, I have several knights and bishops actively placed, and I need to make a strong move.

Looking at the position, I notice:
- I have two knights on d5 and e5 that are centralized
- My bishop on e7 has several possible moves
- White has a queen on b2 and a bishop on e5
- My king is on g8 with castling already completed

One of the strongest moves I see is to develop my bishop to a more active square while potentially threatening something.

One of the strongest moves appears to be developing my bishop with c5e7, which develops a piece while protecting the king's position. This bishop will be well-placed on e7, controlling important diagonals and supporting my kingside.

I notice White has a queen on b2 and a bishop on e5. My e-pawn has advanced to e4, which is putting pressure on White's position.

One strong move would be to develop my knight on e5 to f3, creating a fork threat against White's king on f2 and rook on h1. This would be a powerful tactical shot.

3. I have a bishop on e7 that could develop further

Given these observations, I'll capture White's bishop with my knight, which also puts pressure on White's position:

I notice my knight on e4 is attacking White's pawn on d2, but it's also under attack by White's pawn on f3. My bishop on e7 has several potential moves, and I have a bishop on e5 that's well-positioned.

Looking at the position strategically, I should consider:
1. Protecting my knight on e4
2. Continuing development
3. Improving my king's safety

I think castling kingside would be a strong move here, as it brings my king to safety and connects my rooks. This is a fundamental principle in chess - secure the king and connect the rooks early.

As Black, I notice:
- My king is on g8 with the rook on f8 (castling is still possible)
- I have a knight on e5 that's quite active in the center
- I have a bishop on e7 that could be developed
- White has pawns on d4, e5, f4, and h4 controlling central squares

Looking at my options, I want to improve my position. The knight on e5 is already well-placed, so I should consider castling for king safety or developing other pieces.

Castling kingside would be a strong move here to secure my king's position:

You are a professional chess player and you play as black. Now is your turn to make a move. Before making a move you can pick one of the following actions:
- 'get_current_board' to get the schema and current status of the board
- 'get_legal_moves' to get a UCI formatted list of available moves
- 'make_move <UCI formatted move>' when you are ready to complete your turn (e.g., 'make_move e2e4')

Player_Black (to Proxy):

After analyzing the position, I see several good options as Black. I notice my knight on e5 is well-placed but could be captured by the f-pawn. I also see my bishop on e7 has several potential moves.

Looking at the position strategically, I should consider:
1. Castling kingside to improve king safety
2. Developing my queenside rook
3. Improving my minor piece positioning

Since my king is still in the center and White seems to have some kingside development, I'll prioritize king safety by castling kingside.

2. White has advanced pawns on d4, e5, f4, and h4
3. My king is on g8 with the rook still on h8
4. I have a bishop on e7 that could be developed better

Looking at my options, I notice the knight on e5 is well-positioned and can make several strong moves. One particularly attractive move is Nf3+, which would give check to the White king.

I notice I have a knight on f3 that's quite active and can make several good moves. I also have opportunities to develop my pieces further or strengthen my pawn structure.

Given that White has advanced pawns on d4 and e4, I'll play my knight to e5, which attacks these central pawns and establishes a strong outpost in the center. This is a typical strategic idea in many openings.

I notice I'm playing Black and the position appears to be in the middle game. I have two bishops (c5 and c8), a knight on e5, and my king is on g8. White has a bishop on g4 and appears to have castled kingside.

Looking at my options, I see several strong possibilities:
1. My knight on e5 is well-positioned and can make several moves
2. My bishop on c5 is active and has multiple good options
3. I could develop my rook on a8 or castle

After evaluating the position, I think the best move is to develop my bishop on c5 to e7, which protects my king and maintains good control of the center.

1. The knight on c4 is active and has many good squares. Moving it to e5 would be strong, attacking White's position.
2. My bishop on e7 could develop to better squares.
3. I could also consider king safety moves.

The knight move to e5 looks particularly strong as it attacks multiple squares and improves my piece position.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

I'll analyze the position as Black:

The position appears to be in the middle game with material roughly equal. I notice my king is on g8, and I have a knight on e5 that seems well-placed. White has a bishop on g4 that could be threatening, and there's some pawn tension in the center.

Looking at my options, I see several strong candidate moves:
1. Developing my rook with `a8b8` or connecting my rooks with `g8f8`
2. Moving my knight on e5, which has several good squares
3. Making pawn moves to improve my position

The knight on e5 is particularly well-placed and controls several important squares. I should consider if it's under threat or if I can improve its position further.

After evaluation, I'll develop my queenside and connect my rooks by moving:

After analyzing the position and my available moves, I notice a few key elements:

1. I have a knight on e5 that's quite active and could potentially fork pieces
2. My bishop on e7 has several potential moves
3. My king is currently on g8 with the rook on f8 missing (likely castled kingside)

I'll make a solid move by developing my king to safety:

make_move g8f8

This move improves my king's position by moving it away from the h-file where White might launch an attack. It also connects my rooks, which improves my coordination. This is a standard king safety move in positions where I've castled kingside.

Looking at the position, developing my pieces and improving my king's safety would be priorities. I notice I can castle kingside with either rook (h8g8 or f8g8).

Castling is a strong priority in the middlegame, and kingside castling with the f-rook (f8g8) looks best as it connects my rooks and puts my king in safety.

The knight on e5 is well-placed but potentially under threat from the f-pawn. Moving it to c4 would put pressure on White's position while maintaining a central presence. The move e5c4 looks particularly strong as it attacks White's pawn structure.

I'm playing as Black and have a knight on c4 that's quite active. It's threatening the white pawn on e3 and could potentially fork pieces. I also notice my bishop on e7 has several good diagonal moves available.

Looking at the overall position, developing my pieces and improving my position would be beneficial. The knight on c4 is already well-placed, so I should consider either:
1. Developing another piece
2. Improving my king's safety
3. Addressing any immediate threats

One strong move would be to develop my bishop with e7d6, which would control more of the center and protect my knight indirectly.

The position shows I'm playing as Black with a fairly developed position. White has a pawn on d4 and f4, creating a central presence. I notice my knight is on c4, which is quite active, and I have bishops on d6 and e7.

Looking at my options:
- I have castling options (g8f8, g8e8)
- My queen has several possible moves
- My knight on c4 is active and has multiple options
- I have various pawn moves available

The knight on c4 is well-positioned and putting pressure on White's position. One particularly strong move I see is c4e3, which forks White's e-pawn and potentially other pieces.

I notice that my king is on g8, and I have both rooks, both bishops, and my queen still on the board. White has advanced pawns on d4 and f4, which are controlling central squares.

Looking at my options, I see a few good candidate moves:
1. Developing my bishop with `d6e5` to attack the pawn on f4
2. Moving my queen to a more active position with `d8e7` or `d8f6`
3. Improving my king's safety with `g8f8`

I think the most principled move is to develop my light-squared bishop to e5, where it attacks the f4 pawn and controls more of the center.

After analyzing the position and my legal moves, I can see that:

1. My king is on g8 with the rook on h8 and f8 empty, suggesting I could castle queenside
2. My bishop on e5 is active and has several good options
3. White has a pawn on d4 that could be captured by my bishop

One of the strongest moves here is to capture the d4 pawn with my bishop, which would win material and improve my position.

Let me analyze the position and make a good move as Black.

I notice several key aspects of the position:
- I have a bishop on d4 that's very active and threatening White's position
- White has a bishop on d4 that's attacking my pawn on c7
- My king is on g8 with rooks on b8 and h8

Looking at my options, I see several strong candidates:
1. The bishop on d4 has multiple attacking options (f2, g1)
2. I could develop with moves like c7c6 or c7c5
3. I could improve my king's safety with g8f8 or g8e8

The bishop on d4 is particularly strong, and I see it can attack White's kingside with d4f2, potentially winning material or creating threats.

Looking at my bishop on f2, it's currently pinning the white king and has several good retreat squares if needed. I should capitalize on this pressure.

I'll make a move with my bishop on f2, retreating to e3 which maintains pressure on the white king while also controlling more of the center.

Let me analyze the position:

I see that I'm playing as Black and have several interesting options. The position appears to be in the middlegame with some pieces already exchanged. I notice my bishop on e3 is quite active and has many potential moves.

Looking at the board, I see that:
1. My bishop on e3 is attacking White's kingside
2. I have control of some central squares
3. My king is still on g8 with the rook on f8 missing (likely castled kingside)

Among my options:
- Moving my bishop on e3 could maintain pressure
- Developing my queen could increase my attacking chances
- King safety moves might be prudent

The most promising move appears to be developing my queen to f6, which would add pressure to White's position and connect with my bishop's diagonal.

One of the strongest moves here is to capture the white bishop with my bishop:

make_move e3d4

This captures a bishop for free, which is a significant material gain (worth approximately 3 pawns). This move also puts pressure on the center of the board and removes one of White's active pieces. After this capture, White will likely recapture with the d-pawn, but that would weaken their pawn structure and give me more control of the center.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

After analyzing the position and available moves, I'll make my decision.

The position shows I'm playing as Black with a queen on f6 and a bishop on f2. I notice my bishop on f2 is attacking White's king on e1, but it's not a check because there's a white bishop on d1 that could capture my bishop.

I see a strong opportunity to improve my position by moving my bishop from f2 to e1, which would be a check and also attack White's rook on a1. This creates a tactical threat.

One of the strongest moves I see is to use my bishop on e1 to attack White's kingside. The move e1g3 looks particularly strong as it puts pressure on White's position.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

After analyzing the position, I can see I'm playing as Black with a fairly developed position. I notice:

- I have both bishops out (one on e5 threatening diagonals)
- My queen is on f6 with good activity
- White has a pawn on d4 that could be targeted
- My king is on g8 with rooks on b8 and h8

One of the strongest moves here appears to be moving my bishop on e5 to capture the knight on f4, which would win a piece. However, I don't see f4 occupied by a knight on the board, so I need to make another strong move.

The bishop on e5 is well-placed, attacking diagonals and potentially threatening White's position. I could consider developing my rook from h8 to e8 to control the e-file, which would strengthen my position.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

I apologize for the error. Let me check the legal moves again and make a valid move.

Looking at the legal moves list, I see that "h8e8" isn't actually a legal move. Let me select a strong move from the available options.

The bishop on e5 is well-positioned, but I notice it can capture on d4, which would win a pawn. This would be a material gain and also disrupt White's pawn structure.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

After analyzing the position, I see several strong options as Black. I have a queen on e5 that's actively placed in the center, and a bishop on e3 that's also well positioned.

Looking at the board, I notice my queen on e5 is attacking the d4 square which could threaten White's position. Additionally, my bishop on e3 has good diagonals.

One of the strongest moves appears to be moving my queen to d4, which puts pressure on White's position, attacks the pawn on d3, and maintains control of the center.

This move puts pressure on White's position by attacking the f5 pawn and controlling important squares around White's king. It maintains my bishop on a strong diagonal and increases my attacking potential.

I'm playing as Black and I notice I have a material advantage with two bishops versus White's knight and bishop. I have a bishop on f4 that's quite active and threatening several squares.

Looking at the legal moves, I see I can improve my position by developing my bishop on f4. The move f4g3 looks particularly strong as it attacks White's king on d3 and puts pressure on White's position.

This is a tactical opportunity I should exploit immediately. By moving my bishop to d6, I'll be giving check to the White king, forcing a response, and potentially gaining a tempo or creating further tactical opportunities.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

I can see all my legal moves now. Let me analyze the position:

I'm playing as Black and have a fairly standard position. White has a knight on e5 that could be threatening some squares. I notice I have both bishops developed, but my knights aren't visible on the board (likely captured or not yet developed).

Looking at the available moves, I should prioritize king safety and piece coordination. Since my king is on g8 with a rook on f8, I have the opportunity to castle kingside with either "f8g8" or "h8g8" (depending on which rook I want to move).

Castling is generally a good priority in the middlegame to protect the king, and I see that White's king is already castled (on d3).

I'll choose to castle kingside by moving the rook from f8 to g8:

- My dark-squared bishop on d6 has good mobility and is attacking along the a3-f8 diagonal

Looking at the legal moves, I see several strong options. The bishop on d6 has particularly good options, including a potential check on g3. Let me choose this aggressive move to put pressure on White's position.

2. White has a bishop on h8 that's attacking my pawn on a1
3. I have a rook on b8 and another on g8, with my king on g8
4. Material seems roughly equal

The most critical move I see is with my bishop on g3, which is currently putting the white king in check. I should consider the best follow-up.

Looking at my bishop's options from g3, I can move to:
- d6 (checking the king again)
- e5 (maintaining pressure)
- f4, h4 (retreating)
- h2, f2, e1 (going deeper into white's territory)

The move g3d6+ looks particularly strong as it maintains the check and attacks the knight on d4 simultaneously.

After analyzing the position, I can see I'm playing as Black with my king on g8. White has a somewhat exposed king on d3, but I need to focus on my own position first.

I notice my dark-squared bishop on d6 has several good options. It's currently pinning White's knight on c3 to their king on d3, which is a tactical advantage. I also have both rooks and my light-squared bishop in play.

Looking at the available moves, I think the most principled move is to improve my king's safety by moving it away from the h-file and connecting my rooks:

- White has a bishop on f4, knights on b1 and c2, and a rook on f1
- White's king is on d3

One of my strongest pieces is the bishop on d6, which is actively placed and controls several important squares. I should consider either protecting it or using it to attack.

Looking at the moves, I see that my bishop on d6 has several options, including d6f4 which would capture White's bishop. This would be a good material gain.

I'll make this capture:

- 'get_legal_moves' to get a UCI formatted list of available moves
- 'make_move <UCI formatted move>' when you are ready to complete your turn (e.g., 'make_move e2e4')

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

After analyzing the position, I see several interesting options:

1. I have two bishops - one on b8 and one on f4. The f4 bishop is particularly active and threatening.
2. My king is on g8 with rooks on b8 and f8, so I could consider king safety moves.
3. I have various pawn moves available.

The bishop on f4 is very well placed, attacking the white king's position. I notice it has several strong moves, including g3 which would put pressure on the white position.

I'll play the bishop move to g3, increasing the pressure on White's kingside and maintaining my active piece placement.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

I see the position now. I'm playing as Black and have several options. 

Looking at the board, I notice I have a bishop on g3 that's actively placed deep in White's position. I also see that my king is on h8 with a rook on f8, so castling is not an option anymore.

The bishop on g3 has several strong moves available. I could play Bg3-d6 which would attack White's knight on c3, or I could play Bg3-e5 which would control important central squares.

After analyzing the position, I think the best move is to develop my bishop to d6, which puts pressure on White's knight and improves my piece activity.

I'll analyze the position and make a strategic move as Black.

Looking at the board:
- I have both bishops and rooks, with a solid pawn structure
- White has two knights and one rook
- There's an opportunity to develop my pieces and improve my position

Among my options:
- I could castle kingside with either f8g8 or h8g8
- I could develop my dark-squared bishop with moves like d6e5 or d6c5
- I could advance pawns to control more space

Castling would be a good priority to secure king safety. Since both f8g8 (O-O) and h8g8 are legal, I'll choose the standard kingside castle.

- White has a rook on f4 that's currently attacking my f7 pawn
- White's king is on d3, quite active
- White has knights on b1 and c2
- I have bishops on b8 and d6, and rooks on a8 and h8

The bishop on d6 is particularly active and has several good options. I notice it can move to f4, capturing White's rook which is a strong tactical opportunity.

After analyzing the position, I'll capture the rook with my bishop:

- I have both bishops (on b8 and h6) and both rooks (a8 and g8)
- My king is on g8 with some pawn protection
- The dark-squared bishop on h6 has a powerful diagonal

The bishop on h6 has several strong diagonal moves available. In particular, I can attack White's knight on c1 with Bh6-c1, or I could play Bh6-f4 which would attack the d2 square and maintain control of important central squares.

However, I notice that my king on g8 is somewhat exposed, and it might be good to improve its position. Moving the king to f8 would centralize it and prepare for potential endgame play.

After consideration, I'll move my king to f8, which improves its position and maintains flexibility in my position.

3. I notice White's king is exposed on e4

Given White's king position, my best move is to attack it with my bishop:

make_move h6f4

This move puts White's king in check from my bishop. Since the king is already on e4 (in the center), this creates immediate pressure and forces White to respond to the check, giving me the initiative.

I'll analyze this position carefully.

I notice that:
- I'm playing as Black and have both bishops (on b8 and f4)
- White's king is exposed on d4
- I have a powerful bishop on f4 that's attacking several squares

The bishop on f4 is particularly strong and can deliver a check by moving to e3. This would force the White king to move and give me a tactical advantage.

After analyzing the position, I see I'm playing as Black and have several good options. I notice my bishop on e3 is very active and is currently attacking the White king on d3. I also have both rooks and my other bishop still on the board.

One of the strongest moves here is to increase the pressure with my bishop by moving it to f4, which maintains the attack on the king while controlling more squares.

The bishop on f4 is threatening White's king, and I can deliver a check by moving it to e3. This would put immediate pressure on White's king.

I notice I'm playing as Black and have two bishops (on b8 and e3), two rooks (on f8 and b8), and my king on h8. White has two knights on a1 and b1, and the white king is on d3.

Looking at my legal moves, I see I have a bishop on e3 that has many diagonal options. This bishop is currently attacking the white king on d3, creating a check. However, the king can simply move away.

The most active piece I have is the bishop on e3, which has great mobility. I should use it to maintain pressure while developing my other pieces.

I'll move my bishop to f4, which maintains pressure in the center, controls important squares, and keeps my bishop active on a good diagonal.

The bishop on f4 is particularly strong and can create threats. I'll move it to g3, which puts pressure on White's position and maintains the bishop's activity while targeting the queenside.

Looking at my legal moves, I have several good options. The bishop on g3 is very active and threatening White's position. I should consider either:
1. Developing further with a pawn move
2. Improving my bishop's position
3. Castling (if available)

The bishop on g3 is particularly strong, controlling the long diagonal. I can move it to d6, e5, h4, f4, h2, f2, or e1. Among these, moving to e5 would control important central squares.

I'll make this move:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

I need to analyze this position carefully. 

I see that I'm playing as Black and have several interesting options. The position looks somewhat unusual with White's king on c3 and my bishops on e5 and b8. I notice my king is on g8 with a rook on f8, and I have a potential attack developing.

The bishop on e5 is particularly strong, controlling several key diagonals. I could consider moves like e5xf6 if there's a pawn there, or use the bishop to attack White's position.

Looking at my legal moves, I think the most powerful option is to use my bishop on e5 to attack White's position:

3. I have castling options available (both h8g8 and f8g8 are legal)

Looking at the position, I should prioritize development and king safety. Castling kingside would be a good move to connect my rooks and improve my king's safety.

I need to analyze the position carefully before making my move.

Looking at the board, I notice:
- I'm playing as Black with my king on g8
- White's king is on c3, quite exposed
- I have two bishops (c3 and c8)
- White has two knights (d4 and d7)
- The pawn structure is somewhat intact but there are some open files

The bishop on c3 is attacking White's king, which is a powerful piece. However, it's currently under attack by the White king. I should consider either moving it to safety or supporting it.

Among my options, moving the bishop on c3 to a safer square while maintaining pressure seems wise. The move c3d4 would capture a knight and maintain pressure.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Looking at the position, I see I'm playing as Black with a material advantage. I have two bishops while White has only a knight. White's king is exposed on c3, and I have a bishop on d4 that's actively placed.

The most striking opportunity is my bishop on d4, which has several strong moves. I can consider:

1. d4f2 - attacking White's position
2. d4e3 - controlling important central squares
3. d4g1 - going deep into White's territory

After analyzing the position, I believe the most powerful move is to play my bishop to e3, which controls important squares, maintains pressure, and keeps my bishop active in the center.

Looking at the board:
- I'm playing as Black with my king on g8
- White's king is on c3
- I have two bishops (b8 and e3) and two rooks (a8 and g8)
- The position appears to be in the middlegame/endgame phase

The bishop on e3 is very active and pins White's knight on d4 against their king on c3. This is a powerful tactical motif. I should capitalize on this pin.

The best move appears to be capturing the pinned knight with my bishop:

The most powerful piece I have is the bishop on d4, which is attacking White's king area. I should consider using it to create threats or gain material.

Looking at the moves, I see that d4f2 would attack White's position, potentially setting up threats. This move puts pressure on White's position and maintains my bishop's strong diagonal control.

- I have two bishops (b8 and d4) and two rooks (a8 and g8)
- My bishop on d4 is attacking White's knight on c3
- There appears to be an opportunity for a strong move with my bishop on d4

Among my legal moves, the bishop on d4 has many options. The most powerful appears to be capturing White's knight on c3, but I don't see a knight there on the board visualization. Let me consider other strong moves.

Given the position, I'll move my bishop to e3, which puts pressure on White's position and controls important central squares.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

I'll analyze the position:

I'm playing as Black and have several pieces: a rook on g8, king on h8, pawns on a7, b7, d7, f7, g7, h7, and two bishops - one on c8 and another on e3.

My bishop on e3 is very active and is currently attacking White's king on d4. This is a powerful piece that I should use effectively. I also notice that my rook on g8 can move along the g-file.

Looking at the legal moves, I have several strong options:
1. I could move my bishop on e3 to threaten other pieces or control more squares
2. I could reposition my rook on g8
3. I could advance my pawns

The most powerful move appears to be using my bishop to check the White king. Among the bishop moves, e3d4 would capture the king, but that's not legal in chess (the interface must be showing this as a legal move erroneously). Instead, I should use my bishop to control important squares while maintaining pressure.

I'll move my bishop to f4, which maintains pressure on the king while controlling more of the center.

The most promising move appears to be f4h2, which moves my bishop to attack White's h-pawn on h4. This would win a pawn while maintaining my bishop's activity.

2. g8g7 - Moving my king from g8 to g7

Let me analyze the position:
- I'm playing as Black and have a material advantage with two bishops and a rook vs White's knight
- My king is on g8 and White's king is on d4
- There's a white pawn on g7 that's threatening to promote
- I need to decide whether to capture that pawn with my rook or my king

The best move is to capture the pawn with my rook, as this maintains my material advantage while stopping the pawn promotion threat. Moving my king would also capture the pawn, but using the rook is better as it keeps my king safer.

Looking at my legal moves, I notice I have a bishop on h2 that has several diagonal moves available. This bishop is currently attacking along the a7-g1 diagonal and could potentially create threats.

The most active move appears to be moving my bishop from h2 to d6, which would put pressure on the center and potentially threaten White's pieces. This move develops my bishop to a strong central square.

1. g7f8 - Moving my king from g7 to f8
2. g7h6 - Moving my king from g7 to h6
3. f7f6 - Moving my pawn from f7 to f6

Let me analyze these options:

- g7f8: Moving my king to the back rank. This keeps my king protected but might be more passive.
- g7h6: Moving my king to h6 might expose it more, especially with White's bishop on e4 controlling that diagonal.
- f7f6: Advancing my f-pawn gives my king more breathing room and could help develop my position.

Given that my king seems relatively safe on g7 and I want to improve my pawn structure, I'll advance my f-pawn.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

I can see all my legal moves now. Let me analyze the position:

I'm playing as Black and have two bishops and a rook, while White has a king, knight, and bishop. Material is roughly even, but I need to consider the best move.

Looking at the position:
- My king is on g7 with some pawn protection
- I have a bishop on e1 that's actively placed on the long diagonal
- I have another bishop on c8
- My rook on g8 is currently undefended

The most promising moves appear to be:
1. Improving my bishop on e1, which has several good options
2. Moving my king to a safer square
3. Advancing pawns to create more space

The bishop on e1 is particularly strong, controlling the a5-e1-h4 diagonal. Moving it to h4 would put pressure on White's position.

I'll make this move:

Player_Black (to Proxy):

After analyzing the position, I can see several important features:
- I'm playing as Black with my king on g7
- White has a king on c3, a bishop on c7, a knight on b2, and pawns on a4 and h4
- I have a rook on g8, bishops on c8 and h4, and several pawns

The most critical observation is that my bishop on h4 is attacking along the diagonal and could potentially deliver a check or even win material. This looks like my strongest option.

I'll play the bishop move from h4 to e1, which attacks the undefended knight on b2 after it moves.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

I need to analyze this position carefully. As Black, I have several pieces to consider:
- A king on g7
- Rook on g8
- Two bishops (c8 and e1)
- Several pawns

The white king is on c3, which is quite active, and there's a white bishop on a4 that could be threatening. White also has a knight on b2.

Looking at my options, I notice my bishop on e1 has several strong moves available. This bishop is currently undefended but very active, controlling the a5-e1 diagonal. 

I think the best move is to develop my bishop to f2, where it checks the white king and forces a response. This is a strong active move that puts immediate pressure on White.

- I have two bishops (c8 and e3) and a rook (g8)
- Material seems roughly equal
- My king is somewhat exposed

The bishop on e3 is very active and has many good options. I notice it can attack the white knight on b2 with the move e3b6. This would put pressure on White's knight while maintaining my bishop's activity.

Another strong option is to improve my rook position with g8e8, centralizing it.

After consideration, I'll choose to attack the knight with my bishop:

I can see that I'm playing as Black and my king is on g7 with four possible moves: g7h8, g7f8, g7f7, or g7g6.

Looking at the position:
- I have two bishops (c8 and d4) and a rook on g8
- White has a king on d4, a knight on b2, and a bishop on d2
- There's a potential threat from White's knight and bishop

Since my king is not in check currently, I should choose the safest square. Moving to g6 would put me on the same diagonal as White's bishop on d2, which could be dangerous. Moving to h8 would restrict my king's mobility in the corner.

Between f7 and f8, f8 seems safer as it keeps my king connected to my rook on g8 and maintains more escape squares.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

I need to analyze this position carefully. I'm playing as Black and I notice:

1. Material is roughly even - I have two bishops, a rook, and pawns while White has a knight, bishop, and pawns
2. White's king is exposed on e4
3. I have a bishop on d4 that's attacking White's position
4. My king is on f8 with my rook on g8

Looking at my options, I see a powerful move: my bishop on d4 can attack White's knight on b2 while maintaining pressure on the e5 square and the diagonal.

You are a professional chess player and you play as black. Now is your turn to make a move. Before making a move you can pick one of the following actions:
- 'get_current_board' to get the schema and current status of the board
- 'get_legal_moves' to get a UCI formatted list of available moves
- 'make_move <UCI formatted move>' when you are ready to complete your turn (e.g., 'make_move e2e4')

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Now I have a clear picture of the position and my legal moves. Let me analyze the situation:

I'm playing as Black and have two bishops (on c8 and b2), a rook on g8, and my king on f8. White's king is on d4, and there's a white bishop on d2.

Looking at my options, I notice that my bishop on b2 has several strong moves, including b2e5 which would put pressure on White's position. This move would attack the a1-h8 diagonal and create threats while improving my piece's activity.

I'll make this move:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

After analyzing the position, I see that I'm playing as Black with my king on f8, a rook on g8, and two bishops on c8 and e5. White's king is on d4, with a bishop on c1 and a few pawns.

I notice my bishop on e5 is attacking White's king on d4, giving check. This is a critical moment. I should capitalize on this check to improve my position.

Looking at my options, the bishop on e5 has several moves. The most powerful continuation would be to maintain the attack while developing my position.

I'll move my bishop to f4, maintaining the check on the White king while moving to a safer square:
