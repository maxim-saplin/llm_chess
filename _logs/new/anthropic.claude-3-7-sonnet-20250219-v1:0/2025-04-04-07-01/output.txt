--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Now I can see all my legal moves. Since this appears to be the first move of the game (White has played 1.h4), I'll respond with a solid opening move.

One of the strongest responses to 1.h4 is to take control of the center with a pawn move. I'll play 1...e5, which:
- Controls the center
- Opens lines for my bishop and queen
- Is a classical response that develops my position well

After analyzing the position, I have several good options as Black. Since this is early in the opening, I should focus on development and control of the center.

One of the strongest moves here is to develop my knight to f6, which develops a piece, helps control the center, and prepares for castling. This is a standard developing move in many openings.

After analyzing the position and my available moves, I'll make a decision.

I notice my knight on e4 is well-placed but could be vulnerable. My other knight on c6 is solid. I should continue development while maintaining my central presence.

The most principled move here is to develop my light-squared bishop. This will help connect my rooks and improve my position.

Castling is a priority in this middlegame position as it will secure my king and connect my rooks. This is particularly important since White has already developed pieces toward the center and kingside.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

After analyzing the position, I can see several interesting options as Black. 

I notice that my knights are well-positioned, especially the knight on e4 which is centralized and attacking several squares. I also have two bishops and my queen is developed.

Looking at the position strategically, I see that:
1. My knight on e4 is strong but could be challenged
2. I should continue development and consider king safety
3. The f8-e8 move would connect my rooks

The move that stands out is:

make_move f8e8

This move connects my rooks, improves my king's safety, and maintains control of the center. It's a solid developing move that enhances my position while preparing for future operations.

Looking at the position, I notice several key features:
- I have two knights developed - one on c6 and one on e4
- My e4 knight is particularly active and has multiple good options
- White has a bishop on a3 that could be targeting my queenside
- I should continue development and improve my position

Among my options, I see that my knight on e4 has several strong moves. The move e4f2+ looks particularly powerful as it's a check that also forks White's queen on c2.

2. I have a bishop on e7 that could develop
3. My knight on c6 can be developed further
4. I have standard pawn moves available

The most striking opportunity is that my knight on f2 is forking White's queen and rook. This is a very strong tactical shot that will win material.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Thank you for providing the legal moves. Let me analyze the position:

I notice I'm playing as Black and the position is somewhat complex. I see several key features:
- My knight on d3 is very active in White's territory
- I have a bishop pair (e7 and c8)
- My e5 pawn is advanced
- My king is still in the center (g8)

Looking at my options, I see some strong candidate moves:

1. Knight d3-f4 would be aggressive, putting pressure on White's position
2. Knight d3-f2 could fork White's king and queen
3. Knight d3-c1 could capture White's rook if it's undefended
4. Developing with e7-f6 or castling with g8-h8

The most striking move is Nd3-f2+, which appears to fork White's king on e2 and queen on c2. This would be a powerful tactic.

One strong move would be to castle kingside, which would connect my rooks and bring my king to safety.

I notice I have castling available (e8g8) which is usually a good move to secure king safety. My king is currently in the center, which is generally unsafe in the middlegame.

I also have several bishop and knight moves available, and some pawn advances.

Given that my king is in the center and castling is available, I'll prioritize king safety by castling kingside.

Let me analyze the position:

I see I'm playing as Black and have several interesting options. The position appears to be in the middle game with both kings castled. I notice my knight on c6 has some active options, and I have two bishops aimed at the kingside.

Looking at the legal moves, I see tactical opportunities:
- My knight on c6 can move to d4, which would attack White's pawn on b3 and potentially create pressure in the center
- I could push e5-e4, challenging White's central control
- I have bishop development options with both bishops

The most active and promising move appears to be moving my knight to d4, which puts pressure on White's position and improves my piece activity.

After analyzing the position, I see several interesting options. I notice my knight on d4 is active and has multiple potential moves. I also see that my king is on g8 with potential to castle or move to safety.

Looking at the position more carefully, I see that my knight on d4 is well-placed and can make several strong moves. One particularly good option is to move it to e6, which would:
1. Attack the white king on d3
2. Protect my e5 pawn
3. Create a strong outpost for my knight

This move would put immediate pressure on White and improve my position.

Looking at the board, I notice:
- I have two bishops on d7 and e7, with the e7 bishop being a knight (♞)
- My king is on g8
- White's king is on d3, somewhat exposed
- I have a pawn on e5 that could potentially advance

Among my legal moves, I see some interesting options:
- e5e4 would advance my central pawn
- e7g5 would develop my knight to a more active position
- d7c6 would develop my bishop

I think developing my knight to g5 would be a good move here. It puts pressure on the center, creates potential threats, and improves my piece activity.

I see a good opportunity to improve my position by developing my rook to connect them. This will strengthen my position and prepare for potential attacks.

I notice my king is on g8, and I have several tactical opportunities. The pawn on e5 is advanced and could be strengthened. My bishop on g5 is actively placed and could potentially pin a white piece. I also have a knight on e6 that could be repositioned to a more active square.

Looking at the available moves, I think developing my bishop from d7 to c6 would be a strong move. This improves my piece activity, controls important central squares, and prepares for potential queenside play.

- I have a queen on d8
- Rooks on c8 and g8
- Knights on e6 and c6
- Bishops on c6 and g5
- Various pawns including an advanced e5 pawn

One strong move is to develop my queen to f6, which would increase pressure on the kingside while maintaining flexibility.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

After analyzing the position and available moves, I see several strong options. 

I notice I have a bishop on g5 that appears to be attacking something important (likely a queen or rook), and my queen on f6 is active. I also have a knight on e6 that could potentially make a strong move.

Looking at the position more carefully, I believe one of the strongest moves would be to develop my queen further with:

make_move f6f3

This move puts pressure on White's position, threatens potential checks, and maintains control of important central squares. The queen becomes more active on f3 while still maintaining protection of key squares in my position.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

After analyzing the position and available moves, I notice several key factors:

1. I have a material advantage with a queen vs no queen for White
2. My king on g8 is relatively safe
3. I have active pieces including two bishops and a knight
4. White's king is exposed on c2

One of the strongest moves available is to attack with my queen, particularly targeting White's exposed king position.

I'll play:

make_move f3f2

This move directly threatens White's king area, putting pressure on the c2 king and creating immediate threats. If White doesn't respond carefully, I could follow up with even stronger threats next move. The queen on f2 controls important squares and maintains my material advantage while increasing pressure.

One of the strongest moves here is to use my queen to attack the white king. The move f2b2 would be a queen sacrifice, but it appears to be checkmate since the white king has no escape squares.

After analyzing the position, I can see I'm playing as Black with a fairly developed position. I have my rooks on c8 and g8, knights on e6 and c6, and bishops on c6 and g5. There's a pawn on e4 that appears to be advanced.

Looking at my options, I notice several strong possibilities:
- I could develop my knight with Ne6-c5 or Ne6-f4
- I could improve my bishop with Bg5-f6 or Bg5-e7
- I could consider pawn moves like f7-f5 to challenge White's center

The knight move Ne6-c5 looks particularly appealing as it would attack White's pawn on a4 while developing to a strong central square. This knight would be well-positioned on c5.

Looking at my options, I notice I can develop my bishop on g5 further with a pin on the white king at c3 by moving to e3. This would create a strong tactical threat.

One strong move is to develop my bishop on e3 with a check, which would force White's king to move and give me the initiative:

After analyzing the position and my available legal moves, I need to make a strategic decision.

I notice that my king is on g8 and I have a bishop on c1 that could develop further. I also see that my e4 pawn is advanced and could be pushed. Let's evaluate some key options:

1. The bishop on c1 could be developed with c1d2 or c1b2
2. I could push my e-pawn with e4e3
3. I could improve my king position with g8f8
4. I could move my rook with c8d8

Given that White's king is somewhat exposed on c3 and I have a bishop on c5 that's already well positioned, I think developing my other bishop from c1 to b2 would be strong, creating a diagonal threat toward White's king position.

4. I have a knight on c6 that could be repositioned

Looking at the legal moves, I see an opportunity to increase pressure on White's king with my bishop on b2. The move b2c3 would directly attack the White king, forcing an immediate response.

The position appears complex with several pieces in play. As Black, I notice my king is on g8, and I have two rooks, two bishops, and a knight actively placed. White's king is on c3, somewhat exposed.

Looking at my options, I see a strong tactical opportunity with my bishop on c5. The bishop is currently attacking along the a7-g1 diagonal, and I can deliver a check to White's king.

I apologize for the error. Let me check the legal moves again and make a valid move.

Looking at the legal moves list more carefully, I see that c5d4 isn't actually legal. Let me select a better move from the available options.

The bishop on c5 can move to d4, but the UCI notation for that would be c3d4 (since the bishop is actually on c3, not c5 as I mistakenly thought).

Player_Black (to Proxy):

I'll analyze the position carefully before making my move.

I notice I'm playing as Black and have several interesting options. The position appears to be in the middlegame with both kings relatively exposed. My king is on g8 with a rook on each side (c8 and g8). I have a knight on c6 and a bishop on c5.

Looking at the legal moves, I should consider:
1. King safety - potentially moving my king to f8
2. Developing my rooks - possibly moving one of my rooks to the center
3. Using my knight or bishop actively

The white king is on d4, which is quite exposed in the center. My knight on c6 can attack the white knight on e5 with Nc6xe5, but that move isn't listed in the legal moves, so the knight on e5 must be protected.

One strong move would be to centralize my rook with c8d8, putting pressure down the d-file toward the white king.

- I have a knight on c5 that could potentially fork pieces
- My bishop on c6 has good diagonal control
- White has a knight on d6 that's attacking my position

Looking at the legal moves, I see an excellent opportunity with my knight on c5. I can play Nc5-e4, which:
1. Attacks White's king on d4
2. Creates a strong central knight position
3. Threatens potential forks

This is clearly the strongest move in the position.

One of my strongest moves is to use my knight on e4 to fork White's king and rook with Nf2+. This would give me a check and force the king to move, after which I can capture the rook on e5.

The most active and strong move appears to be moving my knight from f2 to e4, where it attacks White's king on e5. This creates an immediate check and forces White to respond.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

After analyzing the position, I see several key elements:

1. I'm playing as Black with my king on g8
2. There's a knight on e4 that's attacking White's king on e5
3. I have a bishop on c6 that could develop pressure
4. White has a knight on d6 that's forking my rooks on d8 and h8

The most critical move here is to check the White king with my knight. This creates an immediate threat and forces White to respond to the check rather than capturing one of my rooks.

3. I have a rook on d8 that could move along the back rank.

The most striking opportunity is that my knight on g4 can attack the white king on f6 with a check by moving to e5.

The most decisive move appears to be moving my knight from e5 to g4, which maintains the check on the white king while attacking from a different angle. This forces the king to move and maintains my tactical pressure.

I see that I'm playing as Black with my king on g8. White has a rook on c3 and h6, a knight on d4, a bishop on b2, and the white king is on f4. I have a knight on f2 which is attacking the white rook on h6.

Looking at my legal moves, I notice several key opportunities:

1. My knight on f2 can capture the rook on h6 with f2h1
2. I could move my rook on d8 in various directions
3. I could move my king to f8 or e8
4. I have various pawn moves available

The most valuable move appears to be capturing the white rook with my knight. This would win material without any immediate drawbacks that I can see.

I'll play this knight check, which is a strong move that forces White to respond to the check.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

After analyzing the position and my legal moves, I notice several important factors:

1. I'm playing as Black with my king on g8
2. White has a dangerous rook on h6 and another on c3
3. I have a knight on f2 that's actively placed in White's territory
4. There's a white knight on d4 threatening some of my squares

Looking at my options, I see a strong tactical opportunity with my knight on f2. It can deliver a fork by moving to g4, attacking both White's king on f6 and the rook on h6 simultaneously.

My knight on g4 is attacking White's rook on e5, which is a key tactical opportunity. I should capture that rook since it's undefended.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

After analyzing the position and my legal moves, I notice I'm playing as Black with my king on g8. White has a knight on d4 threatening my c6 square, and a rook on e5 that could be dangerous. I also see White's king is on f6.

I should prioritize king safety and consider the tactical elements. Looking at my options, I see I can move my king or one of my rooks, or make various pawn moves.

The most natural move appears to be to improve my king's position by moving it to f8, which maintains protection of my g7 pawn while getting out of the back rank.

- White has a knight on d4 that's attacking my c6 square
- White has rooks on e5 and h5, and the king is on f4
- I need to consider my best move

Looking at the position, I see that I can connect my rooks with Rf8-g8 or Rf8-e8. This would be a good strategic move to strengthen my position.

I'll choose to connect my rooks with:

- My options are to capture the knight, block the check, or move my king

Looking at my legal moves, I can either:
1. Move my king to f8: g8f8
2. Capture the knight with my rook: d8e8

Capturing the knight with my rook is clearly the better option as it eliminates the threat while gaining material.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

I need to analyze this position carefully. I'm playing as Black and have several options.

Key observations:
- My king is on g8 with a rook on g7
- I have a rook on e6 that's very active
- White's king is on f4, somewhat exposed
- White has a rook on g6 and c3, and a bishop on b2

Looking at my options, I notice my rook on e6 has many powerful moves. I can potentially attack White's king or create threats. The most aggressive and strong move appears to be:

make_move e6e4

This move directly attacks the a4 pawn while putting pressure near White's king. If White's king moves, I might be able to capture the a4 pawn. If White defends the pawn, I maintain the pressure and can consider other threats on my next move.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

After analyzing the position, I see that I'm playing as Black with my king on g8 and rooks on g7 and e4. White has a rook on c7 threatening my b7 pawn, and another rook on h6. White's king is on f4.

I notice my rook on e4 is very active and can deliver a check. This would be a strong move as it forces the white king to move and gives me the initiative.

- White's king is on f6
- I have both rooks (e8 and g8) and my king is on h8
- White has material advantage with a bishop, knight, and rooks

The most pressing issue is the rook on c7 threatening my b7 pawn. I also need to consider my king's safety.

One strong move would be to centralize my king with Kf8, which also protects the f7 pawn and improves my king's position.

- White has a rook on c7 that's attacking my b7 pawn
- White has another rook on h6 and a bishop on d4
- White's king is on f4

The most pressing issue is that my king appears to be in a somewhat vulnerable position. I should prioritize king safety while maintaining control of the position.

Among my options, I see that I can castle kingside with either "h8g8" or "f8g8". Since my king is already on g8, these must be rook moves to complete the castle.

The move "f8g8" looks best as it connects my rooks and improves my king's safety. This is a standard kingside castle completion move.

1. I'm playing as Black and my king is on e8
2. White has a rook on c7 that's attacking my b7 pawn
3. White has a bishop on c4 and rooks on g6 and h6
4. White's king is on f4

Looking at my options, I need to prioritize king safety and address immediate threats. The rook on c7 is threatening my b7 pawn, but moving that pawn would expose my king to checks.

Since my king is currently safe and I have two rooks (on e5 and g8), I should use them effectively. Moving my king to f8 connects my rooks and improves my king's position.

My king is on g8, and I have two rooks on f8 and g8, plus some pawns. I notice White's rook on c7 is threatening my b7 pawn. I also need to be careful about potential checkmate threats.

One of my best moves would be to centralize my rook with f8e8, which improves my rook's position and maintains defense of the 8th rank.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

I'll analyze the position:

I'm playing as Black, and I see I have a king on g8 with rooks on f8 and g8. White has a rook on d4 attacking my a-pawn, a bishop on b3, another rook on h4, and a knight on g1.

Looking at my legal moves, I need to consider:
- My king's safety
- Defending my a7 pawn which is under attack
- Improving my piece positions

The most critical issue is the rook on d4 attacking my a7 pawn. I should defend it.

I'll make the move:

3. I have two rooks on f8 and g8, and several pawns

Looking at the position, I notice that my rook on f8 is undefended and can move along the back rank. Moving it to e8 would create a more connected defense for my king.

I'll make this move:

I notice that White has a rook on d4 threatening my position, and I have my king on g8 with rooks on f8 and g8. My pawn structure is somewhat compromised.

Among my legal moves, I should prioritize king safety and counterplay. The most natural move appears to be moving my rook from f8 to e8, which maintains protection of my kingside pawns while giving my rook more mobility on the e-file.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

I can now see my legal moves. Let me analyze the position:

I'm playing as Black and I notice:
- I have my king on e8 with rooks on e5 and g8
- White has a rook on d7 threatening my position
- White has a bishop on c7 controlling important diagonals
- My king is currently in check from White's rook on d7

Since my king is in check, I must address this immediately. Looking at my options:
- I can move my king to f8 (connecting my rooks)
- I can move my king to d8 (but this might walk into other threats)
- I can capture the checking piece with my rook (e5d5)

Wait, I don't see e5d5 in the legal moves list, which means the rook on e5 can't capture the checking piece. Looking more carefully at the board, I see the rook is actually on e5 but the checking piece is on d7, not d5.

The safest move appears to be moving my king to f8, which connects my rooks and moves out of check.

The most urgent issue is to protect my king and address the threat on f8. Moving the rook to e8 maintains my rook's activity while getting it out of the direct attack.

Looking at my options, I need to prioritize king safety and counter White's threats. The most pressing issue is the white rook on f6 attacking my g7 pawn.

I'll move my rook from e8 to e1, creating a strong counterattack on White's back rank. This threatens checkmate if White doesn't respond appropriately and creates active counterplay.

I need to carefully analyze this position. I'm playing as Black, and I see that:

1. My king is on g8 with a rook on h8
2. White has a bishop on d7, a rook on f6, and another rook on h1
3. White's king is on f5
4. I have a rook on e1 that's currently attacking the e-file

Looking at my legal moves, I notice I can deliver check with my rook on e1 by moving it to e8. This would force White's king to move and give me the initiative.

I can see the current board position. I'm playing as Black and I notice I have two rooks on the top rank (e8 and g8), my king on h8, and some pawns. White has a bishop on d7, a rook on f7, and various other pieces.

Let me check what legal moves I have available.

Now I can see my legal moves. Let me analyze the position:

I notice that White's bishop on d7 is attacking my rook on g8, and White's rook on f7 is controlling the 7th rank. My king is on h8, and I have two rooks on e8 and g8.

Looking at my options:
- I can move my g8 rook to f8, which would defend against the bishop's attack
- I can move my e8 rook along the e-file or horizontally
- I can move my pawns on a6, b6, or g7

The most pressing issue is that my g8 rook is under attack by the bishop on d7. I should either move it or defend it. Moving it to f8 seems best as it protects the rook while maintaining control of the back rank.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

After analyzing the position, I can see that I'm playing as Black with my king on g8 and rooks on e8 and f8. White has a bishop on d7 and a rook on f6 threatening my position.

I notice that my king is in a somewhat vulnerable position, and I should prioritize safety. Looking at my legal moves, I have several king moves and rook moves available.

The most pressing concern is to ensure my king's safety. Moving the king to h8 would be walking into a potential check from White's knight on h6, so that's not ideal.

One of the strongest moves here would be to connect my rooks with:

make_move f8g8

This defends my king, connects my rooks for better coordination, and maintains a solid defensive position. The connected rooks will provide better protection for my king and potentially create counterplay along the back rank.

4. I'm likely in a difficult position

Looking at my legal moves, I notice I can move my king or my g7 pawn. The most pressing concern is my king's safety. With White's bishop on d7 and rook on f6, there's significant pressure.

The safest move appears to be to castle kingside, which would move my king to g8 and rook to f8, providing better king safety.

- White has a king on f6, a rook on f1, a bishop on f4, and a knight on h6
- Material is roughly even
- My king is somewhat exposed with White's pieces approaching

Key considerations:
1. King safety is a priority
2. The f-file is contested with my rook and White's rook
3. I should maintain control of the 7th and 8th ranks

Among my legal moves, I see several rook moves and pawn moves. The most principled approach is to keep my rook active while ensuring king safety.

I'll move my king to g8, which maintains king safety while keeping my rook flexible.

The most critical aspect of this position is that my king is in the corner with the white pawn on g7 threatening to promote. I need to address this immediate threat.

My best move is to capture that pawn with my king:

3. Material is roughly equal, but I need to be careful about my king's safety

Looking at my options, I notice my rook on f8 is undefended and could be captured by White's rook on f1. I should either move it to a safer square or defend it.

I also need to improve my king's position since it's somewhat exposed.

Among my legal moves, I think the best option is to move my rook to a safer position while maintaining control of the f-file:

I need to analyze this position carefully. 

I see that I'm playing as Black and I have my king on g7, a rook on f7, and pawns on a6, b6, and h7. White has a king on f3, a rook on f2, a knight on g1, a bishop on f4, and pawns on a4, b4, and g3.

The most critical aspects of this position:
1. Material is roughly equal
2. My king seems exposed on g7
3. I need to consider safety and potential counterplay

Looking at my legal moves, I should prioritize king safety while maintaining control. The move h7-h6 creates a safe square for my king at h7 if needed and prevents any potential checks from that direction.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

I need to analyze this position carefully as Black.

Looking at the board:
- I'm playing as Black with my king on g7 and a rook on f7
- White has a king on e5, a rook on f6, a bishop on f4, and a knight on g1
- There's a dangerous situation with White's bishop on f4 controlling the diagonal

The most pressing issue is my king's safety. White's rook on f6 is threatening my position, and I need to address this immediately.

Among my options:
- Moving my king (g7h8, g7g8, g7f8, g7f6)
- Moving my rook (f7f8, f7e7, etc.)
- Pawn moves (b6a5, a6b5, h6h5)

The safest move appears to be retreating my king to g8, which maintains protection from my rook and avoids any immediate threats.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Now I understand the position and my available moves. Let me analyze the situation:

I'm playing as Black with my king on g8. White has a bishop on e5 that's attacking my position, and White's rook on f2 is also a potential threat. I have a rook on f6 that's currently protecting my king.

Looking at my legal moves:
- King moves: g8h8, g8f8, g8h7, g8g7
- Pawn moves: a6b5, b6a5, h6h5

The most critical factor is my king's safety. The bishop on e5 is controlling diagonals, but not directly attacking my king. I should avoid moving to g7 as that would put my king on the same diagonal as White's bishop.

Moving my king to h8 (the corner) is generally a safe choice in endgames. It reduces the number of potential check squares and keeps my king protected.

I can see this is an endgame position where I'm playing as Black. Let me analyze the position:

1. I have my king on h8 and a rook on f7
2. White has a king on e1, a rook on f2, a bishop on a2, and a knight on g1
3. There are several pawns for both sides

Looking at my legal moves, I need to make a strong move. The most active piece I have is my rook on f7, which controls the f-file. I should consider:

1. Attacking with the rook along the 7th rank (potentially targeting White's position)
2. Moving my king to safety if needed

Since my rook on f7 has many options and is already well-positioned on the 7th rank, I'll use it to put pressure on White's position by moving it to the a-file, which could potentially target White's bishop on a2.

3. My rook has multiple options along the 7th rank
4. My pawns can advance (h6-h5) or capture diagonally (b6-a5, a6-b5)

Looking at the position, I should use my rook actively. Moving it to h7 would create a threat along the 7th rank while also protecting the h6 pawn. This gives me good control of the 7th rank and maintains flexibility.

Now I can see all my legal moves. Let me analyze the position:

I have my king on g8 and rook on h7, with pawns on a7, b7, and h6. Looking at the legal moves, I can:
- Move my king from h8 to g7
- Move my rook along the 7th rank (h7 to g7/f7/e7/d7/c7/b7/a7)
- Advance my h-pawn from h6 to h5
- Advance my a-pawn from a7 to a6
- Advance my b-pawn from b7 to b6

Wait, there seems to be a discrepancy between the board display and the legal moves. The board shows my king on g8, but the legal moves suggest it's on h8. Also, the legal moves suggest my pawns are already on a6 and b6, but the board shows them on a7 and b7.

Based on the legal moves provided, I'll make what appears to be the strongest move - controlling the 7th rank with my rook to restrict White's king and potentially support my passed pawns.

- A king that can move from h8 to g8, h7, or g7
- A rook on f7 (not f6 as shown in the board) that has multiple options
- Pawns on b6 and h6 that can advance

Looking at the position, my best move is to use my rook to capture White's rook on f2, which would be a significant material gain.

I can see the current board position. This appears to be an endgame situation where I'm playing as Black with a king on h8, a rook on f2, and pawns on b7 and h7. White has a king on d1, a knight on g1, a bishop on a2, and pawns on a3, a4, and g6.

Let me check what legal moves I have available.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Now I can see all my legal moves. Let me analyze the position and make the best move:

The position shows I have a rook and two pawns against White's bishop, knight, and three pawns. My king is on h8, and I have a powerful rook on f2 that's currently attacking White's bishop on a2.

Key observations:
- My rook on f2 is very active and can capture White's bishop on a2
- My pawns on b7 and h7 are potential promotion candidates
- White's king is far away on d1

The strongest move appears to be capturing White's bishop with my rook:

1. I have a rook vs knight endgame with some pawns
2. My rook is active on a2, threatening White's a3 pawn
3. White's a7 pawn is dangerous and close to promotion
4. I need to make a decision between capturing the a3 pawn, moving my king, or advancing my pawns

The most immediate threat is White's a7 pawn. I should either capture the a3 pawn with my rook or use my rook to control the a-file to prevent the pawn from promoting.

Taking the a3 pawn immediately seems best as it removes a pawn and maintains control of the a-file:

Player_Black (to Proxy):

I see that I'm playing as Black and I have only two legal moves for my king: h8h7 or h8g7.

Looking at the position:
- I have a king on h8 and rook on a5
- White has a king on d1, knight on g1, and pawns on a4, f3, and b2
- I also have pawns on b6 and h6

Since I only have two king moves, I need to choose the better one. Moving to h7 keeps my king more centralized and maintains better control of the g-file. Moving to g7 would expose my king more to potential checks from White's knight.

h7h8,h7g8,h7g6

I see my legal moves as Black. Let me analyze the position:

I'm playing as Black with my king on g8. White has a rook on a8, a knight on g1, and pawns on a4, g6, and b7. I have a rook on a5 and a pawn on h7.

My three legal moves are:
- h7h8 (promoting my pawn to the 8th rank)
- h7g8 (moving my pawn diagonally to g8, which would be a capture if there's a piece there)
- h7g6 (moving my pawn diagonally to g6, which would be a capture of White's pawn)

Since h7g6 allows me to capture White's pawn on g6 without any immediate threats, this is clearly the best move. Taking material when it's safe to do so is generally good.

I see the position now. As Black, I have a rook on a3, my king on g6, and pawns on b6 and h6. White has a rook on h7, a knight on g1, a king on d1, and pawns on a4 and g5.

Looking at the position critically:
1. My king on g6 is in the same file as White's rook on h7, but not directly attacked
2. My rook on a3 is free to move and could be used actively
3. I should consider both defensive and offensive possibilities

The most promising moves appear to be:
- Using my rook actively with a3g3 to control the g-file
- Moving my king to a safer square like f6
- Advancing my rook with a3a5 to attack White's a-pawn

After evaluation, I believe the strongest move is to activate my rook to control the g-file, which will restrict White's king and create threats.

Looking at the position, I need to make a careful decision as Black. 

I notice that:
- My king is on g6 with several possible moves
- I have a rook on g3 that has many options
- I have pawns on b6 and h6

The white pieces are:
- King on d1
- Rook on e5
- Knight on g1
- Pawn on a4

The most pressing concern is the white rook on e5, which is attacking the e-file. I should consider either defending against potential threats or creating counterplay.

One of the strongest moves appears to be moving my rook to control more of the board while maintaining pressure. Moving the rook to e3 would control the e-file and put pressure on White's position.

Key observations:

- White's rook on f6 is threatening my king's position
- I need to either defend against threats or create counterplay

The most powerful move appears to be to use my rook to create a threat or check. Moving my rook to e1 would deliver check to the white king.

I need to analyze this position carefully. I'm playing as Black with my king on g6 and I have a rook on g1, a pawn on b6, and a pawn on h6. White has a king on c2, a rook on f4, and a pawn on a4.

Looking at the legal moves, I need to consider:
1. King safety - my king on g6 is somewhat exposed
2. Rook activity - my rook on g1 has many possible moves
3. Pawn advancement

The most active piece is my rook on g1, which controls the g-file. I should use it to create threats or gain an advantage. Since White's rook is on f4, I can consider attacking it or creating a more powerful position.

I'll move my rook to g2, which maintains control of the g-file while getting closer to White's king on c2. This could set up future threats against White's king.

Looking at the position and legal moves, I see a critical opportunity: I can capture White's rook on f7 with my king.

This is an excellent move because:
1. It removes White's rook, which is a major piece
2. It eliminates the immediate threat to my king
3. It significantly improves my position in this endgame

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

After analyzing the position and my legal moves, I can see several strong options. 

I notice my rook on f2 can control important files, and my king on f6 is currently safe. The most critical aspect of this position is that I have a rook while White only has a pawn in addition to the king. I should use this material advantage.

Looking at the moves available, I see that I can:
1. Move my rook to control the f-file where my king is
2. Push my h-pawn forward
3. Move my king

The most powerful move here is to control the 6th rank with my rook, which would prevent White's king from advancing and support my own king. This would help me control the position while potentially stopping White's b-pawn from promoting.

Let me check what legal moves I have as Black.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

I notice there's a discrepancy between the board display and the legal moves. The board shows my king on f6 and rook on f3, but the legal moves suggest I have a piece on f7 (possibly the rook) and a pawn on h6 rather than h3.

Let me analyze the position based on the legal moves provided:

Looking at the legal moves, I have a king (likely on f6 based on the board display) that can move to g6, e6, d6, c6, b6, f5, and other squares. I also appear to have a piece on f7 that can move to g8, f8, e8, g7, e7, g6, and e6 - this is likely a rook. And I have a pawn on h6 that can move to h5.

Given this endgame position, my priority should be to advance my pawn while keeping my rook active and king safe. The h-pawn is a potential winning asset.

I see the position now. As Black, I have a king on f7 and a rook on f6, with a pawn on h5. White has a king on c4 and a pawn on b3.

Looking at the legal moves, I need to make a strong decision. The most powerful piece I have is my rook on f6, which has many possible moves. Since White's king is on c4, I can use my rook to control important files and potentially set up a checkmate.

I'll play my rook to the first rank to cut off White's king and control more of the board:

Player_Black (to Proxy):

I'll analyze this position carefully:

I'm playing as Black with a king on f7 and rook on f1, plus a pawn on h5. White has a king on d3 and a pawn on b2.

This is a winning position for Black. I have my rook on the f-file with complete control, while my king is relatively safe. My best move here is to use my rook to control the board and potentially win White's b-pawn.

I'll move my rook to f2, which puts pressure on White's position and controls important squares. This move maintains my rook's activity while staying safe from the white king.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

I notice there's a discrepancy between the board display and the legal moves. The board shows my king on f6, but the legal moves suggest it's on f7. Let me analyze the position carefully.

Looking at the legal moves and the board together, I can see I have a rook on f2 that can move along the f-file or horizontally. I also have my king which can move to several squares.

One of the strongest moves here is to use my rook to control the 4th rank and restrict the white king's movement.

Looking at my options, I see a winning move: I can capture White's h4 pawn with my pawn.

- White king on f4
- Black king on f6
- White pawn on b7 (close to promotion)
- Black pawn on h4

Let me check what legal moves I have as Black.

- King moves: f7g8, f7f8, f7e8, f7g7, f7e7, f7g6, f7f6, f7e6
- Pawn move: h4h3

Looking at this position critically:
1. White's pawn on b7 is dangerous and close to promotion
2. My h-pawn is advanced but will take several moves to promote
3. I need to decide whether to advance my pawn or use my king to stop White's pawn

The most urgent threat is White's b7 pawn. If I don't address it immediately, White will likely promote it soon. My king needs to race toward that pawn.

From f7, the fastest route to the queenside is via e7, d7, c7, etc. So my best move is:

Looking at this position strategically:
1. My pawn on h4 can advance to h3, getting closer to promotion
2. My king can move in several directions

The most critical aspects of this position are:
- White's b7 pawn is very close to promotion
- My h4 pawn is my only counterplay
- I need to decide whether to advance my pawn or move my king toward White's pawn

Since White's pawn is just one step away from promotion, I need to either block it or capture it soon. The most urgent move is to advance my pawn to create counterplay.

Looking at the position:
- White's pawn on b7 is one move away from promotion
- My pawn on h6 can promote immediately

The best move is clear - I should promote my pawn to a queen immediately, which will give me a decisive material advantage.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Now I can see all my legal moves. Since this is the first move of the game for Black, I'll choose a strong opening response.

White has played a3, which is a somewhat passive first move. As Black, I should aim to control the center and develop my pieces efficiently. One of the strongest responses would be e7e5, claiming a central square and opening lines for my bishop and queen.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

I can see all my legal moves now. Let me analyze the position:

1. We're in an open game with e4-e5
2. White has played a3, which is unusual and not particularly threatening
3. I should focus on standard development

The most principled moves here would be:
- Nf6-g8 (retreat, but not ideal)
- Nc6 (developing the knight to its best square)
- d5 (challenging the center immediately)
- Bc5 (developing the bishop to an active square)
- Nf6-e4 (aggressive knight move, but might be premature)

Among these options, developing the knight to c6 is the most standard and solid choice. It controls important central squares, prepares for potential d5 pushes, and follows opening principles.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

I can see the position now. This appears to be early in the game, with White having played e4 and possibly f3. As Black, I need to continue my development.

Looking at the legal moves, I notice I can develop my bishop to e7, which would be a solid choice. This develops a piece and prepares for castling. The knight on f6 is already well placed, so developing another piece makes sense.

Thank you for providing the legal moves. Let me analyze the position:

I'm playing as Black and I notice several key aspects of the position:
- My king is on g8 with the rook on f8 nearby
- I have a bishop on e7 that could develop
- My knight on f6 has several options including e4 which attacks the pawn on e5
- The e5 pawn is currently under attack by my knight on f6

After evaluating the options, I think capturing the e5 pawn with my knight is a strong move, as it wins material and improves my position.

I can see all my legal moves now. Let me analyze the position:

I notice I have a knight on d2 that's deep in White's territory, which is quite active. I also see my other knight on c6 has several good options. My bishop on e7 is developed but could be more active. I have a pawn on e5 that could advance.

Looking at the position strategically, I should consider:
1. Protecting my knight on d2 which appears to be under attack
2. Continuing development of my pieces
3. Improving my king's safety

The knight on d2 seems to be a priority as it's likely under attack. Moving it to either c4 or e4 would maintain its central influence while escaping.

I'll make a move with my knight from d2 to e4, which attacks White's bishop on c3 and maintains an active central position.

1. I have two knights - one on c6 and one on e4, with the e4 knight being particularly active
2. My dark-squared bishop on e7 has several diagonal moves available
3. I can develop my rooks or continue pawn development

One of the strongest moves appears to be capturing the bishop on c4 with my knight from e4, which would win material.

I need to analyze the position carefully before making my move.

Looking at the board, I notice:
- White has a bishop on c4 threatening my f7 pawn
- My knights are active on c3 and c6
- White has a pawn on e5, controlling key central squares
- I need to continue development and ensure king safety

The knight on c3 is particularly strong, having infiltrated White's position. I can use it to create threats or gain material. One of the strongest moves appears to be c3e4, attacking White's queen on d6 while also threatening the pawn on f2.

I'll make this move:

- White has a bishop on c4 that's attacking my f7 pawn
- My king is on g8 with the rook on f8
- White has a rook on b2 and a queen on d1

Looking at my options, I see several strong candidate moves:

1. Knight e4 to c3 - attacking White's queen and rook simultaneously (a fork)
2. Knight e4 to f2 - attacking White's king and rook (another fork)
3. Knight c6 to e5 - developing to a strong central square
4. Bishop e7 to c5 - developing with pressure on the center

The knight fork on f2 looks particularly strong as it attacks both the king and rook. This would force the king to move and I could capture the rook on the next move.

One strong move would be to develop my knight on d1, which is currently undeveloped and blocking my queen's rook. Moving it to c3 would develop the piece and attack White's bishop on e4.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

After analyzing the position and available moves, I'll make my decision.

The position shows I'm playing Black in what appears to be a complex middlegame. I notice my knight on e5 is well-positioned in the center, and I have another knight on c3 that has infiltrated White's position. My king is castled kingside, and I have a bishop pair at e7 and e5.

Looking at the available moves, I should prioritize improving my position and potentially increasing pressure on White's position. The knight on c3 is particularly interesting as it's deep in White's territory.

I'll develop my knight on c3 to e4, which centralizes it further and creates pressure in the center. This knight move threatens White's f2 pawn (which appears to be missing) and improves my piece coordination.

I notice I have two knights well-positioned in the center at e4 and e5. One good option would be to develop my light-squared bishop from c8. However, I don't have a direct move for that.

I see that my knight on e4 has several good options. Particularly attractive is the move e4f2, which would fork White's king on e1 and rook on a1. This is a tactical opportunity that should be seized.

2. I have a knight on e5 that has several good options
3. I have a bishop on e7 with multiple possible moves
4. I also have a knight on h1 that appears to be somewhat out of play

Castling is often a priority to improve king safety, and in this position it looks like a good option since my king is still in the center and White's king is already castled (on c3).

I'll make the move to castle kingside:

- I have a knight on e5 that's centralized and active
- My king is on g8 with some pawn protection
- White has a bishop on h8 that's deep in my territory

One of the strongest moves I see is to use my knight on e5 to attack White's king with a fork. The move e5f3+ would check the king and also attack White's rook on a8.

3. My king on g8 could castle queenside by moving to e8

Looking at the position strategically, I notice that my knight on f3 is well-positioned and applying pressure. Moving my bishop from e7 to develop further or my king to safety would be good options.

I'll choose to castle queenside by moving my king from g8 to e8, which will connect my rooks and bring my king to safety.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

I need to analyze this position carefully. 

I notice several interesting features:
- White has a bishop on g4 threatening my queen
- I have castling rights available (e8g8)
- My knight on f3 is active and has several good options
- White's king is on c3, which seems exposed

Given these observations, I have a few strong candidate moves:

1. Castle kingside with e8g8 to improve king safety
2. Move the knight from f3 to a strong outpost like e5 or g5
3. Develop the rook with a8b8

After evaluating these options, I believe castling is the most urgent priority to secure my king's safety.

I notice I have a knight on f3 that's actively placed and can make several strong moves. One particularly good option is to play Nf3-d4, which attacks the white king on c2 and creates a fork with another piece. This is a tactical opportunity I should capitalize on.

1. I'm playing as Black and my king is on g8
2. White has a bishop on e5 attacking my f7 pawn
3. I have a knight on d4 in a strong central position
4. My other knight is on h1, somewhat out of play

The most pressing issue is the bishop on e5 attacking my f7 pawn, which is a sensitive square. I should either defend this pawn or make a stronger threat.

Looking at my knight on d4, it has several good options. The move d4e6 (Knight to e6) would be particularly strong as it:
- Defends the f7 pawn
- Establishes the knight on a strong central outpost
- Controls important squares
- Threatens the bishop on e5

This is a classic knight fork setup that will improve my position significantly.

I notice that:
- White has a bishop on e5 threatening my queen
- White's king is on c3, quite exposed
- I have knights on e6 and h1 (unusual position)
- White has bishops on e5 and e2

Looking at my legal moves, I need to address the threat to my queen while developing my pieces effectively. The bishop on e5 is attacking my queen, so I should either move the queen or capture/block the bishop.

The knight on e6 can capture the bishop with e6f4, which seems strong as it removes the threat and develops my knight to a good square.

I'll defend the f7 pawn by moving my king to f8, which also improves my king's position and prepares to connect my rooks.

2. My king is on g8 with a rook on f8 and a8
3. I have a knight on g6 that can make several moves
4. I also have a knight on h1 that appears to be trapped in White's territory

The most pressing issue is developing my pieces and ensuring king safety. I should consider either castling (if still possible) or improving my position.

Looking at the legal moves, I see that I can move my king to g8, which suggests I can castle kingside with "f8g8" (rook moves from f8 to g8 in castling).

I'll castle kingside to improve my king's safety:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

I need to analyze this position carefully. 

I notice that:
- White has two bishops (on e5 and h4), a rook on c2, and knights on b2 and g1
- My king is on g8, and I have a knight on g6 that's under attack by White's bishop on h4
- I need to address the threat to my knight on g6

Looking at the legal moves, I have several good options:
1. Move my king to safety with g8f8 or g8e8
2. Defend the knight with h7h6
3. Move the knight away with g6e7, g6e5, g6f4, or g6h4

The most natural move seems to be to move my king to f8, which gets it out of the back rank and creates some breathing room.

3. I have a knight on g6 that has several possible moves
4. I also have a knight on h1 in White's territory

Looking at my options, I should address the pressure from White's bishop on e5 and improve my position. One strong move would be to develop my knight from g6 to e5, capturing White's bishop.

1. White has two bishops (on e5 and h4) that are active
2. My knight on e5 is well-placed and could potentially fork pieces
3. I need to continue development and improve my king's safety

Among my options, I think castling kingside would be a strong move to improve my king's safety and connect my rooks. This is a standard priority in the opening/early middlegame.

Looking at the board:
- White has a bishop on e5 and h4, a knight on c3 and g1, and a rook on c2
- I'm missing a bishop (likely captured) and my king is on g8
- White's king is on d2, somewhat exposed

Key considerations:
- My knight on e5 is attacking White's bishop on h4
- I should consider king safety and development
- There's potential for counterplay against White's king

After evaluation, I'll play the knight move from e5 to g4, which attacks White's bishop on h4 while maintaining a strong central position for my knight.

4. White has some development with pieces in the center

Looking at my options, I should address the threat to my f7 pawn and improve my position. The knight on g4 has several good squares, particularly h6 which would protect f7.

I notice I'm playing as Black and there are several interesting features in this position:
- White has a bishop on e5 attacking my f6 square
- White has another bishop on g6 attacking my h7 pawn
- I have a knight on h1 that can move to g3 or f2
- I have a knight on h6 that can move to several squares
- My king is on g8 and I can castle queenside (moving king to g8)
- White's king is on d2, somewhat exposed

One of my strongest moves appears to be moving my knight from h1 to g3, which would attack White's rook on c3 and potentially create a fork threat.

I'll make this move:

You are a professional chess player and you play as black. Now is your turn to make a move. Before making a move you can pick one of the following actions:
- 'get_current_board' to get the schema and current status of the board
- 'get_legal_moves' to get a UCI formatted list of available moves

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

I need to analyze this position carefully. 

I notice that I'm playing as Black and my king is on h8. White has two bishops on f6 and g6, which are attacking my kingside. I also have knights on h6 and g3, with the g3 knight potentially having some active options.

Looking at the legal moves, I see several key options:
- I could castle queenside with f8g8
- I could move my queen to various squares
- My knight on g3 has several good options including e4, h5, or capturing on e2
- I could make pawn moves to develop

The knight on g3 seems particularly active and could create threats. Moving it to e4 would centralize it and attack White's position. The move g3e4 looks strong as it puts the knight on a central square, attacks White's position, and can't be easily driven away.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

I can see the current position and my legal moves. Let me analyze the situation:

1. White has two bishops on f6 and g6, putting pressure on my kingside
2. White's knight is on e5, controlling key squares
3. My king is on h8 with some pressure on the kingside
4. I have a knight on h6 that could be developed better

One of the most important moves I should consider is castling queenside with "f8g8" to secure my king. This is a priority in the opening/middlegame.

Another strong option is developing my knight from h6 to f5 with "h6f5", which would put it in a more active position and potentially threaten White's knight on e5.

After considering the options, I'll castle kingside to secure my king position:

4. My queen on d8 has several possible moves

One of my most urgent needs is to address the white rook on c7 which is threatening my position. I also need to improve my king's safety.

After analyzing the position, I'll move my king to safety:

- White has a rook on c7 that's attacking my b7 pawn
- White has a knight on e5 in a strong central position
- White has a bishop on g7 threatening my kingside
- My king is on h8 and appears to be somewhat exposed

Among my legal moves, I should prioritize safety and development. I notice I can castle kingside with either rook (h8g8 or f8g8), which would improve my king's safety.

The move f8g8 (castling with the f8 rook) seems particularly strong as it connects my rooks and improves my king's safety.

1. I'm playing as Black and my king is on g8
2. White has a bishop on g7 that's checking my king
3. I need to address this check immediately

Looking at my options to deal with the check:
- I can move my king (g8f8, g8e8, g8d8)
- I can capture the bishop with my knight (h6g4 doesn't work as the bishop is on g7)
- I can block the check (no moves available to block)

The most natural move is to move my king out of check. Moving to f8 seems safest as it keeps my king protected by the rook on a8.

- My queen on c7 has many possible moves
- White has a knight on f5 that's quite active
- I have a knight on h6 that could be developed better

One of the strongest moves appears to be moving my queen to check White's king while also attacking the knight on f5. This would create a double attack (fork).

After analyzing the position and available moves, I see that I'm playing as Black and have several good options. 

I notice my queen on c3 has many potential moves, and there's a white bishop on g7 that could be captured by my knight on h6. I also see my king is on h8 with rooks on a8 and f8.

One of the strongest moves here is to capture the white bishop with my knight:

I apologize for the error. Let me check the board again more carefully. It seems I misread the position. Let me try another move.

Looking at the available moves, I see an opportunity to put pressure on White with my queen. Moving the queen to b4 creates a powerful threat against the white king while maintaining control of key squares.

I'll make a move with my queen to put pressure on White's king position:

This move threatens White's king directly. If White doesn't respond carefully, I could follow up with Qa2+ leading to checkmate. This move maintains control of the board while creating immediate threats.

You are a professional chess player and you play as black. Now is your turn to make a move. Before making a move you can pick one of the following actions:
- 'get_current_board' to get the schema and current status of the board
- 'get_legal_moves' to get a UCI formatted list of available moves
- 'make_move <UCI formatted move>' when you are ready to complete your turn (e.g., 'make_move e2e4')

After analyzing the position and my legal moves, I see several key factors:

1. I have a knight on g3 that's actively placed
2. My queen on e7 has many potential moves
3. My king is on h8 with rooks on a8 and f8

I'll make a strong move with my knight on g3, which is currently attacking squares in White's position. The knight on g3 to e4 looks particularly strong - it moves to a central square where it can exert more influence.

After analyzing the position and my legal moves, I see several key considerations:

1. My knight on f4 is active and has multiple options
2. White has two bishops (e5 and f3) that are controlling important squares
3. I need to continue development and improve my position

One strong move is to develop my knight to g5, which attacks White's bishop on e5 and puts pressure on the kingside. This also creates potential tactical opportunities.

1. White has two bishops (on e5 and f3) but limited material otherwise
2. My king is on h8 with a rook on f8
3. I have a knight on g5 that has several options
4. The pawn structure is mostly intact

Looking at my legal moves, I see I can castle kingside with "f8g8", which would be a good way to improve my king's safety and connect my rooks. This is typically a strong move when available.

I need to analyze this position carefully. 

I'm playing as Black, and I notice several important features:
- White has two bishops (on e5 and h4)
- I have a knight on g5 that's currently attacking White's bishop on h4
- My king is on g8 with rooks on a8 and h8
- The position seems somewhat open

Looking at my legal moves, I see I can:
1. Move my king (g8f8, g8e8, g8d8)
2. Move my knight on g5 (g5e6, g5e4, g5h3, g5f3)
3. Move various pawns
4. Move my rook from a8 to b8

The most pressing decision is whether to capture the bishop on h4 with my knight. Since the knight is attacking the bishop and there doesn't appear to be an immediate trap, capturing seems strong.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

I need to analyze the position carefully. 

I see that I'm playing as Black and my king is on g8. White has bishops on e7 and h4, and the white king is on b2. I have a knight on h3 which is actively placed.

Looking at the legal moves, I notice several key options:
- King moves (g8f8, g8e8, g8d8)
- Knight moves from h3 (to g5, f4, f2, or g1)
- Various pawn moves

The knight on h3 is well positioned and could potentially create threats. Moving to f2 would create a fork threat against the white king on b2 and potentially other pieces.

I'll make this move:

2. I need to be careful about the bishop on e7 which is attacking my king's position.
3. I have several pawn moves available, but I should prioritize the tactical opportunity with my knight.

The strongest move appears to be capturing White's rook with my knight:

Player_Black (to Proxy):

I need to analyze the position carefully before making my move.

I see that I'm playing as Black and the position is quite unusual. White has two bishops (on e5 and f3) and a pawn on h5. My king is on g8, and I have a knight on h1 (which is very unusual - it must have been a complex game so far).

Looking at my legal moves, I notice several key considerations:
- I can move my king to f8, e8, or d8
- I can move my rook from a8 to b8
- I have a knight on h1 that can move to g3 or f2
- I have various pawn moves available

The knight on h1 is in an unusual position and has the opportunity to move to g3, which would attack White's bishop on f5. This seems like a strong tactical opportunity.

I'll make this move:

I can see the current position. I'm playing as Black and I notice that:
- White has two bishops (one on e7 and one on d1), a king on a1, and pawns on h5, b3
- I have a king on h8, rooks on a8 and g8, a knight on g3, a bishop on c8, and several pawns
- The position looks unusual with few pieces remaining

Let me check my legal moves to determine the best option.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Thank you for providing the legal moves. Let me analyze the position and make the best move.

I notice that my knight on g3 has several interesting options, including capturing a pawn on h5 and potential fork opportunities. Let me evaluate the best move:

1. The knight on g3 can capture the pawn on h5 (g3h5)
2. The knight can also move to e4, e2, f5, h1, or f1, potentially creating threats

After analyzing the position, capturing the undefended pawn on h5 with my knight seems to be the best move. This gains material without any immediate drawbacks.

Now I understand the position and my available moves. Let me analyze the situation:

1. I'm playing as Black and my king is on g8
2. White has two bishops (on e7 and d1) and a pawn on h4
3. I have a knight on h5 that's actively placed
4. White's king is on a2, which is quite exposed

Looking at my options, I notice my knight on h5 has several good moves. The move h5f6 would protect my g7 pawn while maintaining an active position. Alternatively, h5f4 would put pressure on the center.

Given the exposed position of White's king, I'll choose to move my knight to f4, which gives me more central control and maintains pressure.

4. White's king is on a2, quite exposed

My knight on f4 is well-positioned and can make several strong moves. The most attractive option is to fork White's king and bishop with Nf4-g2, creating a double attack.

2. White has two bishops (on b7 and e7) that are controlling key squares
3. I have a knight on g2 that's actively placed in White's territory
4. My rooks are on a8 and h8

Looking at my legal moves, I should prioritize king safety and development. The knight on g2 is well-placed and potentially threatening White's position, so I should consider keeping it there.

Since my king is somewhat exposed with the bishops pointing toward my kingside, I should improve my king's position. Moving the king to f8 seems logical as it gets out of potential discovered attacks and maintains flexibility.

I notice that I'm playing as Black and have a knight on g2 that's attacking White's king on b2. However, it's not checkmate because the king can move. I also see that White has two bishops (on b7 and e7) that are attacking my position.

Looking at my options, I should prioritize either:
1. Continuing the attack on White's king
2. Defending against White's threats
3. Improving my piece coordination

The knight on g2 is my most active piece, and moving it to e1 would create a fork between White's king and rook. This would be a strong tactical move.

I need to analyze this position carefully. 

I see that I'm playing as Black and have a knight on e1 that's attacking White's king on b1. However, it's not checkmate because the White king can move. I also notice I have a bishop on c8, rooks on a8 and f8, and my king on h8.

Looking at the legal moves, I have several options. The most pressing issue is that my knight on e1 is under attack by White's bishop on b4. I should either move the knight to safety or capture something valuable with it.

The knight can move to: f3, d3, g2, or c2. Moving to c2 would fork White's king and possibly another piece, which seems strong.

2. White has two bishops (on b4 and d4) that are controlling important squares
3. My king is on g8 with a rook on f8 - I haven't castled yet
4. Material seems roughly equal

Looking at my options, the knight on c2 is my most active piece and is threatening White's king on b1. I should consider either capturing something valuable with it or making a strong threat.

The move c2e1 looks particularly strong as it would put White's king in check while attacking from a safe square. This forces the king to move and gives me the initiative.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

I see the current position and my legal moves. Let me analyze the situation:

1. I'm playing as Black and have a knight on e1 that's deep in White's territory
2. White has two bishops (on c3 and b4) and a king on b1
3. My king is on h8 with a rook on f8 and another on a8
4. I have a bishop on c8

The knight on e1 is a powerful piece that's threatening White's king. I should consider either:
- Moving it to attack a key square or piece
- Developing another piece to increase my attacking potential

Looking at the knight's options, moving to c2 would create a check on White's king, which is a strong move.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

I need to analyze the position carefully before making my move.

Looking at the board, I notice:
- I'm playing as Black with my king on h8
- White has two bishops (on b4 and c3) and the white king is on a2
- I have a knight on c2 which is actively placed in White's territory
- The pawn structure is relatively intact but needs development

The knight on c2 is a strong piece that's deep in White's territory, but it could be vulnerable. I should consider whether to retreat it or use it tactically.

Among my legal moves, I see several good options:
1. Developing my bishop with `c8b7` or `c8a6`
2. Moving my rook with `f8e8` to control the e-file
3. Using my knight with moves like `c2e1` which could be a fork

After evaluation, I think developing my bishop to b7 is strong as it controls the long diagonal and supports my queenside.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

I'll analyze the position and available moves:

The position shows I'm playing as Black with my king on h8, rooks on a8 and f8, a bishop on b7, a knight on c2, and pawns on a7, d7, f7, g7, and h7. White has a king on a1, bishops on b4 and h1, and some pawns.

Looking at my options:
- I could castle kingside with either "h8g8" or "f8g8"
- I have knight moves from c2
- I have bishop moves from b7
- I have various pawn advances

Since my king is on h8 and one of my rooks is on f8, it appears I've already castled kingside. The move "h8g8" would be moving my king, and "f8g8" would be moving my rook to g8.

My knight on c2 is deep in White's territory, which is good. I should consider if it's under threat or if it can make a strong move.

The bishop on b7 is on a good diagonal and has several possible moves.

I think developing my rook to e8 could be a strong move, controlling the open e-file.

Looking at the board, I notice White has a bishop on c3 that's attacking my bishop on b7. I should consider addressing this threat. Additionally, I should look to improve my piece coordination and potentially create threats of my own.

One strong move would be to centralize my rook on e8 by moving it to e4, where it attacks the pawn on h4 and gains activity.

After analyzing the position, I see several strong options:

1. My bishop on d5 is active and has multiple good moves
2. My knight on c2 can make some tactical moves
3. My rook on a1 controls the a-file and has mobility

The most critical decision is whether to use my bishop to capture material or make a tactical move with my knight. Looking at the position, I notice my knight on c2 can fork White's king on b2 and bishop on h1 with the move c2e1.

Thank you for providing the legal moves. Let me analyze the position and make the best move.

I notice several important aspects of the position:
- My bishop on d5 is very active and has many options, including capturing White's bishop on h1
- My knight on e1 is deep in White's territory and has several good outposts
- The pawn structure is relatively intact for both sides

After evaluating the options, I see that my bishop can capture White's bishop on h1, which would be a material gain. This is clearly the strongest move available.

1. I have a knight on e1 and a bishop on h1, both active pieces
2. White has a bishop on d6 that's threatening my position
3. My king is on h8 and appears safe for now

Looking at my options, I notice my bishop on h1 has several strong diagonal moves. Moving it to a8 would control the long diagonal and put pressure on White's position. The knight on e1 could also develop with moves like Nf3 or Ng2.

Given the position, I'll move my bishop to the a8-h1 diagonal for maximum control:

After analyzing the position, I can see that I'm playing as Black with my king on g8, a bishop on a8, a knight on g2, and several pawns. White has a bishop on d5, a king on c3, and some pawns.

I have several good options:
1. I could move my bishop (a8) to various squares
2. I could move my knight (g2) to various squares
3. I could advance my pawns

The bishop on a8 is currently not very active, so developing it would be good. Moving to e4 would place it on a strong central square. Alternatively, the knight on g2 could move to e3, which would fork White's king and bishop.

After consideration, I'll move my knight to e3, creating a fork on White's king and bishop:

Looking at my options:
- I have knight moves from e3 (e3f5, e3d5, e3g4, e3c4, e3g2, e3c2, e3f1, e3d1)
- I have bishop moves from a8 (a8b7, a8c6, a8d5, a8e4, a8f3, a8g2, a8h1)
- I have pawn advances and king moves

The knight on e3 is very well placed - it's deep in White's territory and putting pressure on White's position. I should consider if there's a tactical opportunity with it.

The move e3c4 looks particularly strong as it would capture White's bishop. This would win material and improve my position significantly.

I have a bishop on a8 with several diagonal moves available, and a knight on e3 that's quite active in the center. My opponent has a king on c3, a bishop on f2, and some pawns.

The knight on e3 is in a strong central position and is currently putting pressure on White's position. I should consider moves that maintain or improve this knight's position.

Looking at the knight moves, e3f5 stands out as it moves to an outpost where it can't be easily attacked by pawns and controls important squares. From f5, the knight would control d6, e7, g7, and h6, adding pressure to White's position.

I'll make this move:

make_move e3f5

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

I'll analyze the position as Black:

The position appears to be in the endgame with limited material. I have:
- A king on h8
- A bishop on a8
- A knight on f5
- Several pawns (a7, d7, f7, g7, h7)

White has:
- A king on c2
- A bishop on f2
- Pawns on b2 and h2

My knight on f5 is well-placed in the center and has several good options. I should consider if there are any tactical opportunities or if I need to improve my piece positioning.

Looking at the knight moves, g3 looks attractive as it attacks White's bishop on f2. The move Nf5-g3 would put pressure on White's bishop while maintaining a central knight.

I'll make this move:

make_move f5g3

I need to analyze the position carefully before making my move.

Looking at the board, I see that:
- I'm playing as Black with my king on h8
- I have a bishop on a8 and a knight on g3
- White has a king on b2 and a bishop on f2
- The pawn structure is relatively intact

The most active piece I have is my knight on g3, which has several good options. I should consider if there are any tactical opportunities or if I need to improve my position.

The move Ng3-e4 looks particularly strong as it:
1. Centralizes my knight
2. Attacks the undefended h4 pawn
3. Could potentially fork pieces later

I'll make this move:

Looking at my options, I notice my knight on e4 is very active in the center and has many potential moves. The most aggressive option would be to play Ne4-f2+, giving check to the white king.

Another strong option is to move my king to g8, which would be a natural developing move that maintains my king's safety.

After considering the position, I'll play the knight check which forces White to respond.

White has a king on a4, a bishop on a7, and pawns on b4 and h4.

Looking at my legal moves, I need to consider my best option. My knight on f2 is active and potentially threatening. Let me evaluate my strongest moves:

1. The knight on f2 has several good options, particularly f2d3 which would attack White's b4 pawn.
2. My bishop on a8 could develop to more active squares.
3. I could advance my pawns to create threats or prepare for promotion.

The knight move to d3 looks particularly strong as it attacks White's b-pawn while maintaining a good position.

Thank you for providing the legal moves. Now I can analyze the position and make a decision.

Looking at the position, I notice several key factors:
- My bishop on a8 has an open diagonal and can move to several squares
- My knight on e5 is well-positioned in the center
- White's bishop on d4 is threatening my knight
- White's king is on b3, quite advanced

One of the strongest moves appears to be capturing White's bishop with my knight: e5d3. This would win a bishop for free since the knight is not under direct attack. Taking material when it's safe to do so is generally a good principle.

I'm playing as Black and I have a bishop on a8, a king on h8, pawns on d7, f7, and h7, and a knight on f2. White has a king on c2, a bishop on a1, and pawns on b2 and h4.

Looking at my options, I notice my knight on f2 is quite active and could make some strong moves. The knight on f2 is currently attacking White's bishop on a1, which is undefended. I can capture it with Nxd1 (f2d1).

Now I have a clear picture of my legal moves. Let me analyze the position and make a strategic decision:

1. I notice my knight on d1 has several options, including f2 which would attack White's king on b2.
2. My bishop on a8 has multiple diagonal moves available.
3. I have standard pawn advances available.

The most striking opportunity is the knight move d1f2, which would put White's king in check and potentially lead to a strong attack. This is clearly the strongest move in the position.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

I see that I have two legal moves as Black:
- h8g8: Moving my king from h8 to g8
- h8g7: Moving my king from h8 to g7

Let me analyze the position:
- I'm playing as Black with my king on h8
- I have a bishop on a8, pawns on d7, f7, and h7
- White has a king on b2, a bishop on g7, and pawns on b5 and h5
- Black also has a knight on f6

The White bishop on g7 is controlling the h8-b2 diagonal, which limits my king's movement. Moving to g8 keeps me on the back rank, while g7 moves me closer to the center but into the same diagonal as White's king.

Given the limited options, I'll move my king to g8, staying on the back rank which seems safer.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

I need to analyze this position carefully. I'm playing as Black and have several options.

Key observations:
- My king is on g8 with White's bishop on g7 checking me
- I have a knight on f2 that could be useful
- I have a bishop on a8
- White's king is on a4

The most urgent issue is that I'm in check from the bishop on g7. I need to address this first. My options are:
- Move my king to g7 and capture the bishop
- Block with a piece

Let me choose the strongest move. Taking the bishop with my king seems best as it removes the checking piece and gains material.

Looking at the knight moves, I can play Nf2-d3 which would attack White's king from a distance. This seems like a strong move that puts immediate pressure on White.

I have several strong options, but the knight on d3 is particularly well-positioned. I can deliver a fork with Nd3-f2, attacking both White's king and the h1 square (which could be useful if White has a rook there).

The most promising opportunity seems to be using my knight on f2 to create threats against White's king. The knight can move to:
- e4 (checking the king)
- d3 (threatening a fork)
- h3 (controlling important squares)

The best move appears to be the knight check:

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Let me analyze the position:

I'm playing as Black with a bishop on a8, king on g7, knight on e4, and pawns on d7, f7, and h7. White has a king on a4 and pawns on b5 and h5.

My knight on e4 is well-positioned and has many options. I should consider if there are any tactical opportunities with it. The bishop on a8 is currently not very active.

Looking at the legal moves, I see a few key considerations:
1. My knight can potentially fork pieces or create threats
2. I could develop my bishop from a8
3. I should ensure my king remains safe

The knight on e4 is my most active piece, and moving it to c3 looks particularly strong as it would attack White's king on a4 while being protected by my bishop on a8.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Thank you for providing the legal moves. Now I can analyze the position and make a decision.

Looking at the position, I notice several key factors:
1. My bishop on a8 has the long diagonal available
2. My knight on c5 has several potential moves
3. White's king is exposed on b4

The most promising move appears to be using my knight to attack White's king. The move c5a4 would put the knight in a position to check the king. This would force White to respond to the check and give me the initiative.

- A knight on a4
- My king on g7
- Pawns on d7, f7, and h7
- White's king is on b4 with pawns on b2 and h4

Looking at the legal moves, I have several strong options:

1. The bishop on a8 can move diagonally and potentially attack White's king
2. The knight on a4 can create threats or improve its position
3. I can advance my pawns to create space or threats

The most promising move appears to be moving my bishop to e4, which puts pressure on White's position and controls important central squares. This creates a strong diagonal and threatens to check the White king if it moves.

- My bishop on g2 is very active and controls important diagonals
- My knight on a4 is threatening the white king
- I should look for the most forcing move

The most powerful move appears to be checking the white king with my bishop. This would force a response and maintain pressure.

The most powerful piece I have is the bishop on e4. I notice it can move to h1, which would put it in the corner but maintain control of the a8-h1 diagonal. However, I think a better move would be to use the bishop to control more central squares and potentially threaten White's king.

I'll move the bishop to f3, which puts pressure on White's position and maintains control of important diagonals while being closer to White's king.

- Creates a discovered check from my knight
- Forces the white king to move, after which I can capture material

3. My bishop on c6 has good diagonal control
4. My knight on a4 could potentially attack White's king

Looking at the tactical possibilities:
- My knight on a4 can move to b6 or c5, both putting pressure on White's king
- The move Nc5 would be a knight fork, attacking both White's king and pawn
- My bishop has several good options including Bd5 which controls important squares

I'll play the knight fork which creates an immediate tactical threat.

I see that White has just played Nf3, developing their knight to a standard position. As Black, I should respond with a solid developing move. Let me check my legal moves.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Looking at the available moves, I'll play a solid developing move by bringing out my knight to f6, which is one of the most principled responses to White's Nf3. This move:

1. Develops a piece
2. Controls the center squares e4 and d5
3. Prepares for kingside castling
4. Is part of standard opening theory

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Now I can see all my legal moves. Let me analyze the position and make a strategic decision:

White has played e4 and Nf3, setting up for kingside development and possibly a kingside castle. As Black, I should respond with solid development.

The most principled responses in this position would be:
1. e5 - challenging the center directly
2. d5 - countering in the center with a Queen's Gambit style approach
3. c5 - playing a Sicilian Defense structure
4. e6 - leading to a French Defense structure
5. Nc6 - developing a piece and supporting the e5 square

I'll go with developing my knight to c6, which is a natural developing move that controls the center and prepares for further central play with either e5 or d5.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Now I have a clear picture of the position and my available moves. 

I notice White has played e4 and moved a knight to h5, which is somewhat unusual. As Black, I should focus on controlling the center and developing my pieces.

One of the strongest responses would be to play e5, establishing a presence in the center. This is a classical response to e4 that fights for central control and opens lines for my bishop and queen.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

After analyzing the position, I see that White has moved their queen to g4, creating pressure on my kingside. I need to respond appropriately.

White's queen on g4 is threatening my e-pawn and potentially setting up attacks on my kingside. One of my strongest responses is to capture the queen with my knight, which would be the move f6g4 (Knight from f6 captures on g4).

This is a favorable exchange for me since I'm capturing a queen with a knight, gaining significant material advantage. While White will likely recapture with a pawn, the material gain is well worth it.

The position shows I have my queen on g5 and knights on c6 and g4. White has a knight on h4 and has pushed the e-pawn to e4. I need to continue my development while maintaining a good position.

One strong move would be to develop my bishop to e7, which would protect my king and prepare for castling:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

After analyzing the position and available moves, I'll make my decision.

The position shows I have my queen on g5 and knights on c6 and g4. I notice my king is on g8 with a rook on f8, and I have a bishop on e7 that could develop further.

One strong move would be to develop my bishop to f6, which would protect my queen and increase my control of the center. Another option is to move my knight on g4 to e3, which would attack White's center.

I'll go with developing my bishop to a more active square:

Player_Black (to Proxy):

After analyzing the position and my available legal moves, I can see I have a well-developed position with active pieces. My knights are centralized, and I have the bishop pair.

I notice my queen on g5 is active and can potentially create threats. One strong move would be to increase the pressure with my knight on g4, which can attack White's kingside.

I'll play:

make_move g4e3

This knight move to e3 creates multiple threats:
1. It attacks White's pawn on d1
2. It creates a fork threat against White's king and rook
3. It improves my knight's position to a strong central square
4. It maintains pressure on White's kingside

This move fits with an active strategy and increases my attacking chances.

- My queen is on g5, with some attacking potential
- White has a knight on f3 that could be a target

One of my strongest moves appears to be the knight on e3, which is attacking White's pawn on d1 (potential fork with the king). Let me use this knight to create a tactical threat.

- My queen is on g5, actively positioned
- I have a knight on c6 with several options
- White has a knight on f3 and a bishop on b2
- My king is on g8 with castling already completed

Looking at my options, I notice my knight on d1 is a strong piece that can threaten White's position. I can move it to either e3 (forking the king on e1 and pawn on e4) or f2 (forking the king and rook).

The knight fork on f2 looks particularly strong as it attacks White's king and rook simultaneously, forcing a response.

Looking at the knight on f2, it seems to be in a powerful position with several potential moves. I'll check if any of these knight moves create immediate threats:

- f2g4 could attack White's pieces
- f2e4 attacks White's pawn
- f2d3 could be a good central square
- f2h3 might attack something

The move f2e4 looks particularly strong as it attacks White's pawn on e4 while maintaining a strong central position. This move puts pressure on White's position and could lead to material gain.

I'm playing as Black and have a knight on f2 that's attacking White's king on e4. This is a very strong position for me. I should capitalize on this check immediately.

Looking at the knight moves from f2, I can see several options:

- f2e4 (capturing the king - this would be checkmate)
- f2h3 (knight to h3)
- f2d3 (knight to d3)
- f2h1 (knight to h1)
- f2d1 (knight to d1)

The move f2e4 would be capturing the White king, which means I'm delivering checkmate.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

After analyzing the position and available moves, I'll make my decision.

The position shows I have several active pieces including my queen on g5 and knights on c6 and e4. I notice my e4 knight is particularly strong, attacking squares like f2 and d2.

Looking at the white position, I see the white king is on e2 and somewhat exposed. This presents tactical opportunities.

I'll play my knight from e4 to f2, which creates a fork attacking both the white king on e2 and the rook on h1. This is a strong tactical shot that will either win material or force the king to move, disrupting White's position.

One of the strongest moves appears to be moving my knight from d3 to f2, which creates a fork threatening both White's king on e4 and rook on h1. This is a tactical opportunity I shouldn't miss.

I'll choose to improve my knight's position by moving it from h1 to g3, which develops it to a more central square and puts pressure on White's position.

- White has a bishop on a7 that's attacking my rook on a8
- My queen on g5 is active and could potentially create threats
- My knight on g3 is well-positioned and could be used for an attack

One of my most pressing issues is the bishop on a7 threatening my rook. I should either move the rook or defend it. I also see potential for my queen to create threats.

After evaluating the position, I'll make a move with my queen to create a threat while maintaining its activity.

4. White has a bishop on a7 that's penetrated my position

Looking at the position, I notice my queen on h4 has significant attacking potential. I can use it to put pressure on White's position while developing my other pieces.

I'll move my queen to e4, which:
- Attacks the center of the board
- Puts pressure on White's d4 pawn
- Creates potential threats against White's king
- Maintains flexibility for future moves

Looking at the board, I notice my queen on e4 has many options. One particularly strong move would be to play e4d3, attacking White's king on d1 with a discovered check from my bishop on f6. This would be a powerful tactic.

I'll make this move:

After analyzing the position and available moves, I see I'm playing as Black with a queen on e4 that has many options. I notice my king is on g8, and I have a strong attacking position with my queen centralized.

I'll play a move that increases my queen's activity while putting pressure on White's position:

make_move e4f3

This move threatens White's pieces and pawns while maintaining my queen's central influence. The f3 square allows my queen to attack along the f-file and the a8-h1 diagonal, creating multiple threats that White will need to address.

Looking at the position, I see my queen on f3 is very active and can potentially create threats. One strong move would be to attack White's king with:

make_move f3d3

This move puts pressure on White's position, attacking along the third rank where the White king is located on d4. This creates immediate threats and maintains my queen's activity in a central position. From d3, the queen controls important squares and puts pressure on White's position.

I notice my king is on g8 with a rook on f8, suggesting I haven't castled yet. I have knights on c6 and bishops on c8 and f6. White has pushed some pawns on the queenside (a3, b3, c3) and has a pawn on h6.

Looking at my options, I'll develop my position by castling kingside, which is a strong move that improves my king safety and connects my rooks.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

I'll analyze the position as Black:

The position appears to be in the middlegame with material roughly equal. I notice:
- My king is on h8 with a rook on f8
- I have a knight on c3 that's very active in White's territory
- White's king is exposed on e5
- I have bishops on f6 and c8

Looking at my options, the knight on c3 is particularly strong and could create threats. The move c3e4 looks especially powerful as it:
1. Attacks White's king directly
2. Is a fork between the king and potentially other pieces
3. Controls important central squares

This knight move would create immediate pressure and force White to respond to the check.

- White has a bishop on d4 that's attacking my position
- I have two rooks on a8 and f8, and bishops on f6 and c8

One of my strongest moves is to increase the pressure with my knight. The move Nd3-f4+ would give a check to the White king and create a strong tactical position.

- I have knights on e6 and f6, and bishops on e6 and f6
- White has a bishop on d4 that's attacking into my position
- White's king is on f2 with a rook on d4

Among my options, I see tactical opportunities with my knights. The knight on f6 has several good squares, and I should consider my king's safety.

After evaluating the position, I'll make a move with my knight from f6 to d4, capturing White's piece there if possible, or to another strong square if that's what d4 represents.

Now I have a clear picture of the position and my available moves. Let me analyze the situation:

I'm playing as Black and I notice:
- My king is on h8 with a white bishop on f6 checking me
- I have a knight on e5 and bishops on c8 and f6
- White has a rook on d4 and a knight on a1

Since I'm in check from the white bishop on f6, I must address this immediately. My options are:
1. Move the king (h8g8)
2. Capture the checking piece (not possible)
3. Block the check (not possible)

The only legal response to the check is to move my king to g8.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

I need to analyze the position carefully before making my move.

Looking at the board:
- I'm playing as Black with my king on g8
- White has a bishop on f6 that's checking my king
- I need to address this check immediately

From the legal moves list, I have several options to deal with the check:
1. Move my king (g8h8, g8f8)
2. Capture the bishop with my knight (e6f8)
3. Block the check with a piece

The most important factor is my king's safety. Moving to h8 puts me in the corner which could be dangerous later. Moving to f8 seems risky as it's more exposed.

I notice I can capture the checking bishop with my knight from e6 by playing e6f8, which eliminates the immediate threat and gains material.

- White has a rook on c2 and a knight on a1

The bishop on d4 is particularly strong, controlling several diagonals. I notice it can move to f2, which would attack White's king on f1. This looks like a check that would force White to respond.

One of the strongest moves appears to be:

make_move f2e1

This captures White's rook on e1, delivering check to the king. This is a strong move as it wins material while maintaining pressure on White's position.

You are a professional chess player and you play as black. Now is your turn to make a move. Before making a move you can pick one of the following actions:
- 'get_current_board' to get the schema and current status of the board
- 'get_legal_moves' to get a UCI formatted list of available moves
- 'make_move <UCI formatted move>' when you are ready to complete your turn (e.g., 'make_move e2e4')

Player_Black (to Proxy):

I'll analyze this position carefully before making my move.

Looking at the board, I notice:
- I'm playing as Black and have two bishops (c8 and e5), a knight on f6, and a rook on a8
- My bishop on e5 is particularly active and has many potential moves
- White has a rook on c2 and the king on e2
- Material seems roughly equal

The bishop on e5 is very powerful with many diagonal options. I should consider using it to create threats or improve my position. The move e5h2 looks particularly strong as it attacks White's h-pawn on h3 which appears undefended.

I can see all my legal moves now. Let me analyze the position:

1. I'm playing as Black and I notice I have a bishop on h2 that's very active and attacking deep into White's position.
2. My king is on g8 with a knight on f8 and a rook on a8.
3. White has a king on d3, a knight on a1, and a rook on c2.
4. I have a material advantage with my bishop on h2 that seems to be threatening White's position.

One of my strongest moves appears to be using my bishop on h2 to attack White's position. The bishop on h2 has several good options, and moving it to c7 looks particularly strong as it attacks White's rook on c2.

1. I'm playing as Black and my king is on g8
2. White has a rook on f6 and king on d3
3. I have two bishops (c7 and f8), a knight on f6, and a rook on a8

Looking at my legal moves, I notice my dark-squared bishop on c7 has several strong diagonal moves available. Since White's king is on d3, I should consider if there are any tactical opportunities.

The move Bc7-f4 looks particularly strong as it:
1. Attacks White's rook on f6
2. Creates a pin or potential discovery against White's king
3. Develops my bishop to an active square

I'll make this move:

Looking at my options, the bishop on f4 has many strong moves. I could play f4e3 to attack the white king directly, or f4g3 which would also put pressure on White's position.

Given the exposed position of White's king, I'll play my bishop to e3, creating a direct threat.

After analyzing the position, I see several key factors:

1. I have two bishops - one on f4 that's actively placed and threatening the white king area
2. White has a rook on g4 that could be threatening
3. My king is on g8 with potential safety concerns

One of my strongest moves is to use my bishop on f4, which is well-positioned and attacking white's position. I'll move it to capture on h2, which appears to be a free pawn.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

I need to analyze this position carefully. As Black, I have material advantage with two bishops versus White's knight and rook. White's king is exposed on c3, and my dark-squared bishop on h2 has excellent mobility.

Looking at the legal moves, I notice my bishop on h2 has several strong options. I can use this bishop to create threats while developing my other pieces. The move h2e5 looks particularly strong as it:

1. Controls important central squares
2. Puts pressure on White's position
3. Maintains my bishop's mobility
4. Creates potential threats against White's king

I'll make this move:

2. White's rook on f4 is undefended

The move `e5f4` stands out as particularly strong - capturing White's undefended rook on f4 with my bishop. This is a free piece capture that will give me a significant material advantage.

I notice several key features of the position:
- I have two bishops (one on f4 is particularly active)
- White has a rook on d4 and a knight on b3
- White's king is exposed on c3
- My king is on g8 with some pawn protection

Among my options, the bishop on f4 is very powerful and can make several strong moves. I see an opportunity to put pressure on White's position.

I'll move my bishop from f4 to e3, which attacks White's king directly and creates a strong threat.

3. I have several pawn moves and piece development options

One of the strongest moves here would be to develop my knight to a more active position where it can attack White's exposed king. The knight move f8-g6 looks particularly strong as it develops the piece to an active square, controls important central squares, and prepares potential threats against White's king.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

After analyzing the position and my legal moves, I can see that:

1. I'm playing as Black and my king is on g8
2. White has a rook on d4 and the king on d4
3. I have a knight on g6 that could be developed

Looking at my options, I notice I can develop my bishop with a strong move:

make_move c8b7

This develops my bishop to a good diagonal, adding pressure to the center and kingside while maintaining protection of my pawn structure. The bishop on b7 will control the long diagonal and support potential future attacks.

1. I'm playing as Black and my king is on g8
2. White has a rook on d4 and king on e5
3. I have several pieces including knights, bishops, and pawns

Looking at my options, I notice my knight on g6 has several good moves. The move g6e5 stands out as it would capture White's king, but that's not legal in a real game (the king can't be captured - the game would end with checkmate before that).

Since this appears to be a position where White's king is in check and must be captured, I'll play the knight capture:

I see that I'm playing as Black and have several interesting options. Looking at the board:
- White has a rook on d4 and the king on d4
- I have a knight on e5 that's currently attacking White's rook on d3
- My king is on g8 with some pawn protection

The most immediate opportunity I see is that my knight on e5 is attacking White's rook on d4. I should capture this rook as it's a valuable piece.

- White has a knight on c3, a rook on d4, and the king on c3
- I have my king on g8, knights on g6, bishops on b8 and c6, and a rook on a8
- There appears to be a potential threat from White's rook on d4

My priorities should be:
1. King safety
2. Developing my pieces effectively
3. Countering any immediate threats

The knight on g6 is well-positioned and can control important central squares. Moving my bishop on c6 to d5 would develop it to a strong central position and put pressure on White's position.

After analyzing the position, I can see I'm playing as Black and have several key pieces: a king on g8, a knight on g6, bishops on b8 and d5, and a rook on a8. White has a knight on b7 and the white king is on c3.

I notice my bishop on d5 is attacking diagonally and could potentially capture something or create a threat. The bishop on d5 has several strong diagonal moves available.

Looking at the legal moves, I think the best move is to use my bishop to attack the white king with:

make_move d5f3

This move puts my bishop on f3, creating a check on the white king at c3. This forces White to respond to the check and gives me the initiative.

I'm playing as Black and I have a material advantage with two bishops, a rook, a knight, and several pawns, while White appears to only have a king and a pawn on h4. White's king is on b2, which is quite exposed.

Looking at my options, I should aim to coordinate my pieces for a checkmate. My knight on g6 is well positioned and could be useful in a mating attack. Moving my rook to the a-file to control the second rank seems strong.

I'll move my rook to a2, putting White's king in check and restricting its movement.

I notice my rook on d1 is on an open file and can potentially attack the white king on e2. I also have a knight on d4 in a strong central position.

One of the strongest moves appears to be:

make_move d1e1

This move puts my rook directly in front of the white king, delivering check. This forces White to respond to the check, giving me the initiative. It's a direct attack that limits White's options and could lead to material gain or even checkmate depending on how the position develops.

After evaluating the position, capturing the undefended pawn on h6 seems like the most straightforward improvement to my position. This will remove White's advanced pawn and improve my material advantage.

Looking at the position, I notice I have a knight on d5 (shown as ♞ on the board in the d5 position) that can be used effectively. One strong move would be to bring my knight to f6, which controls important squares and helps restrict the White king.

Thank you for providing the legal moves. Let me analyze the position and make a good move.

I notice I have several pieces that can be developed further. My king is safe for now, and I have opportunities to improve my piece positioning.

Looking at the knight on f6, it has some good outpost options like d5 or e4. The bishop on b7 is already well placed on the long diagonal. The bishop on b8 could be developed to improve my position.

Among my options, developing the bishop from b8 to e5 looks particularly strong - it would control important central squares and create potential threats along the a1-h8 diagonal.

Now I can see the board position. I'm playing as Black, and I have a king on g8, bishops on b7 and e5, a knight on f6, and pawns on d7, f7, g7, and h7. White has a king on d3.

Let me check what legal moves I have available.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

After analyzing the position and my legal moves, I'll make a decision as Black.

I notice I have two bishops and a knight against White's lone king. This is a winning position for me, so I should aim to coordinate my pieces to force checkmate.

The bishop on e5 is particularly powerful, controlling key diagonals. I can strengthen my position by advancing my d-pawn to d5, which would control more central squares and support my minor pieces.

Looking at my legal moves, I should focus on advancing my attack and working toward checkmate. The White king is on d3, and I have several pieces that can coordinate an attack.

My bishop on e1 has good control of the diagonal and can put pressure on the white king. Moving it to f2 would create a strong threat.

White has a king on c2 and no other visible pieces.

Looking at my options:
- My bishop on e3 is very active and controls important diagonals
- My knight on f6 protects my king and controls central squares
- I have a material advantage

Since White's king is exposed on c2, I can use my bishop to deliver a check:

Player_Black (to Proxy):

I need to analyze this position carefully. I'm playing as Black and have several pieces: a king on g8, bishops on b7 and f2, a knight on f6, and pawns on d5, f7, h6, and h7.

Looking at the position, I notice my bishop on f2 is attacking the white king on f5. This is a check situation, and I should consider if there's a way to deliver checkmate or gain material.

The most powerful move appears to be:

make_move f2e3

This move maintains the check on the white king while controlling more squares. The bishop on e3 controls important diagonals and restricts the white king's movement options. This is a strong attacking move that maintains pressure while improving my piece position.

Thank you for providing the legal moves. Now I can analyze the position and make a decision.

Looking at the position, I notice I have two bishops (on b7 and e5), a knight on f6, and my king on g8. I see several promising options:

1. I could move my bishop on e5 (shown as e3 in the move list) to attack White's king on e2 with e3f4, putting the king in check.
2. I could also consider moving the bishop to d4, which would control important central squares.
3. Moving my king to improve its position is another option.

The most forcing move appears to be checking the White king with my bishop. This would force White to respond to the check and potentially give me initiative.

The bishop on f4 is particularly powerful, controlling several diagonals. I can deliver a check with this bishop by moving it to e5.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Thank you for providing the legal moves. Let me analyze the position and make the best move.

I notice there's a discrepancy between the board visualization and the legal moves list. The board shows a pawn on d4, but the legal moves include "d5d4" suggesting there's actually a pawn on d5. Similarly, there appears to be a pawn on h6 (with move h6h5 available) that wasn't clear in the visualization.

Looking at my options:
- I have my king on g8 with standard king moves
- My bishop on b7 controls the a8-h1 diagonal
- My bishop on e4 is attacking the white king on e5
- My knight on f6 has several options
- I have a pawn on d5 that can advance

The most striking feature is that my bishop on e4 is directly attacking the white king on e5. This is a check situation, and the white king must respond to this check on their next move.

Given this position, I'll make a strong move with my knight to g4, which will attack the white king and coordinate with my bishop on e4:

Looking at the board, I see that:
- I have my king on g8
- White's king is on f6
- I have two bishops (b7 and e5), a knight on g4, and pawns on f7, h6, h7, and d5
- The position is quite sparse with no immediate checkmate threats

Among my options, I notice that my bishop on e5 has many potential moves. The knight on g4 is also active. Let's consider the strongest options:

1. The bishop on e5 can move to f6 (e5f6), which would capture the white king. This would be checkmate.

Since capturing the king would end the game immediately with a win for Black, I'll make this move:

One of the strongest moves appears to be using my bishop on f6 to check the white king by moving to e5. This would create a direct attack while being protected by my knight on g5.

Looking at the position, I need to respond to White's Nc3. As a professional chess player, I'll choose a solid developing move.

The knight move Nf6 (g8f6) is one of the best responses here. It develops a piece, controls the center squares e4 and d5, and follows good opening principles. This is a standard move in many openings including the Ruy Lopez, Italian Game, and various defenses against 1.d4.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Now I have a clear picture of the position and my available moves. 

White has played an unusual opening move by developing their knight to a4. This is not a standard opening move as it places the knight on the edge of the board where it has limited mobility.

As Black, I should focus on controlling the center and developing my pieces. Among my options:
- Developing knights to c6 or d5 would be solid
- Playing e5 or d5 would stake a claim in the center
- Developing according to standard opening principles is important

I'll play a strong classical move that develops a piece and fights for central control:

Looking at the position and my legal moves, I need to make a solid developing move. 

White has developed a knight to a4 and pushed the d-pawn to d3. As Black, I should focus on controlling the center and developing my pieces.

One of the strongest moves here would be to push my e-pawn to e5, establishing a presence in the center and opening lines for my bishop and queen. This is a standard opening principle - control the center early.

One good option is to play h7h6, which attacks the bishop and forces it to retreat or exchange itself for my knight. This is a standard response in such positions.

Looking at the position, I notice that White's bishop on g4 is threatening my knight on f6. I should address this threat. I have several good options:

1. I could play h6-h5, attacking the bishop
2. I could develop a piece like Bf8-e7 or Bf8-d6
3. I could protect the f6 knight with g7-g6

After analyzing the position, I'll develop my bishop to e7, which both develops a piece and helps protect my knight on f6.

I can see the current position. Black has developed both knights and bishops, and there's a white bishop on g4 that appears to be attacking my position. Let me check what legal moves I have available.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Thank you for providing the legal moves. Let me analyze the position:

I notice that one of my knights (f6) can capture the white bishop on g4, which would eliminate a threat to my position. This seems like a strong move as I can remove one of White's active pieces.

I'll make this capture:

After analyzing the position and my legal moves, I notice several key factors:

1. My king is in the center (e8) and could benefit from castling
2. White's bishop on g4 is attacking my knight on g4
3. My knight on g4 is undefended and under threat
4. I have development opportunities for several pieces

I'll prioritize king safety by castling kingside, which also activates my rook.

- My knight on c6 is developed
- My pawn structure is generally intact
- White has a bishop on g5 that's somewhat exposed

Among my options, capturing the bishop with my knight would be a material gain:

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Now I have a clear picture of the position and my available moves. Let me analyze the situation:

I'm playing as Black and I notice:
- My king is on e8 with castling still possible on both sides
- White has a bishop on g4 attacking my h-pawn
- I have a knight on h2 that's quite active deep in White's position
- My pawn structure is generally solid

Looking at my options, I see several good candidate moves:

1. Castling kingside with `f8g8` would improve my king safety
2. Developing my knight with `c6d4` could put pressure on White's center
3. Moving my knight on h2 to `f3` could fork White's queen and rook

After evaluation, I believe the knight fork is the strongest move.

2. My knight on c6 is developed and I have several options for my other pieces
3. White has a somewhat exposed king position with castling not yet completed

Among my legal moves, I'll prioritize development and king safety. The move e7f6 (moving my bishop to f6) looks strong as it:
- Develops a piece
- Challenges White's bishop on g5
- Improves my kingside defense
- Prepares for castling

After analyzing the position and my legal moves, I see that:

1. White has developed their bishop to g5, attacking my queen
2. I need to address this threat
3. I have several options including moving my queen or defending it

One of the strongest responses is to play h6, challenging the bishop. However, I notice that's not in my legal moves list, suggesting the bishop might already be on h4 or the pawn is already on h6 (which I can see is the case).

Given the position, I'll play:

make_move f6e7

This knight move to e7 defends my queen while developing a piece to a good central square. It also creates the possibility of castling kingside soon, which will improve my king's safety.

After analyzing the position and my available moves, I notice that White's bishop on g5 is threatening my queen. I should address this immediate threat.

I have several good options:
1. f7f6 - attacking the bishop on g5
2. h6g5 - capturing the bishop directly
3. e7g5 - capturing the bishop with my own bishop

Capturing with the h-pawn (h6g5) seems most straightforward as it eliminates the threat and gains material. This would win a bishop for a pawn.

You are a professional chess player and you play as black. Now is your turn to make a move. Before making a move you can pick one of the following actions:
- 'get_current_board' to get the schema and current status of the board
- 'get_legal_moves' to get a UCI formatted list of available moves
- 'make_move <UCI formatted move>' when you are ready to complete your turn (e.g., 'make_move e2e4')

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

I can now see all my legal moves. Let me analyze the position:

1. I'm playing as Black and the position appears to be in the middle game
2. My king is on e8 and seems safe for now
3. I have a knight on c6 that could be developed further
4. My e7 bishop is active and can move in several directions
5. I have a pawn on e5 that could be advanced

Looking at my options, I think advancing my e-pawn to e4 would be a strong move. This:
- Controls more central squares
- Challenges White's position
- Opens more lines for my pieces, particularly the e7 bishop
- Creates potential attacking chances

I'll make this move:

Now I have a clear picture of the position and my available moves. Let me analyze the situation:

1. I notice my king is on e8 and I have a bishop on e7 that's pinned to my king by White's bishop on e5.
2. My knight on c6 has several options including e5 which would attack White's bishop.
3. I have a pawn on e4 that's advanced and could be pushed further.
4. My kingside is somewhat open with my knight missing from g8.

After evaluating the position, I think developing my knight on c6 to e5 would be a good move. It attacks White's bishop, develops my piece to a central square, and puts pressure on White's position.

I'll castle kingside, which is a strong developing move that improves my king's safety:

I can see the current board position. Let me analyze what's happening:

- White has a rook on h6 that's attacking my g-pawn
- My knight on e3 is attacking White's pieces
- White's bishop is on e5 attacking my position
- I need to see what legal moves I have available

Let me check my legal moves:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

After analyzing the position and the legal moves, I see several key considerations:

1. My knight on e3 is very active and has multiple good options
2. White's rook on h6 is threatening my g7 pawn
3. I need to develop my pieces and ensure king safety

One of the strongest moves I see is to play the knight from e3 to f5, which:
- Attacks White's bishop on e7
- Controls important central squares
- Puts pressure on White's position
- Moves to a stable outpost that can't be easily challenged by pawns

I'll make this move:

After analyzing the position and the available legal moves, I see several key factors:

1. White has a rook on h6 that's attacking my g-pawn
2. I have a knight on f6 with several options
3. My dark-squared bishop on f5 has good mobility
4. My e4 pawn is advanced and could be vulnerable

The most pressing issue is the threat to my g7 pawn. I should either defend it or make a stronger counter-threat.

Looking at my options, I'll play the knight move Nf6-d4, which attacks White's c2 pawn while also maintaining control of key central squares. This is a strong, active move that increases my piece activity.

I see that I'm in a very difficult position. My king on e8 is in check, and I only have three legal moves:

1. e8f8 - Moving the king to f8
2. e8f7 - Capturing the white bishop on f7 with my king
3. e8e7 - Moving the king to e7

Looking at the position:
- If I move to f8, I'm still under threat from the rook on h6 along the 8th rank
- If I move to e7, I'd be moving into a potential check from the knight on b4
- Capturing the bishop on f7 seems to be the best option as it removes an attacking piece

I'll capture the bishop on f7.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

After analyzing the position, I see I'm playing as Black and have several good options. 

I notice my king is on f7, and I have a bishop on g7 that could be developed. My queen on d8 also has potential for activation. Looking at the position, I want to improve my piece coordination and king safety.

The move g7-f6 looks strong as it:
1. Develops my bishop to an active square
2. Controls important central squares (e5, d4)
3. Provides additional protection to my king

I'll make this move:

After analyzing the position, I can see I'm playing as Black and need to make a move. 

I notice several key aspects of the position:
- My king is on f7 and appears somewhat exposed
- I have a bishop on f6 that has several good diagonal options
- My queen is on d8 and rooks on a8 and g8
- White has a knight on c3 that could be threatening

Looking at the legal moves, I see some tactical opportunities with my bishop on f6. The bishop has good mobility and can potentially create threats.

I'll play the bishop move f6g5, which develops the bishop to a more active square, controls important central squares, and puts pressure on White's position.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

I'll analyze the position and my available moves:

The position looks complex with both kings somewhat exposed. As Black, I need to consider both defensive and attacking options.

Key observations:
- My king is on f7 without much protection
- I have a bishop on g5 that's actively placed
- White has knights on c3 and g1, and their king is on d1

Looking at my legal moves, I should prioritize king safety while maintaining active piece coordination.

The move g5e7 (moving the bishop to e7) looks strong as it:
1. Protects my king from potential checks
2. Maintains the bishop's activity on the long diagonal
3. Prepares to connect my rooks

- I have a bishop on g5 that's active
- White has a knight on c3 that could be threatening
- I need to continue development and ensure king safety

Looking at the legal moves, I see several good options:
- Developing my queen with d8e7 or d8f6
- Moving my king to a safer square with f7e8
- Developing my rook with g8e8 or b8a8

I think the most urgent priority is king safety, followed by piece development. The move f7e8 gets my king to a safer square and allows me to connect my rooks later.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

I'll analyze the position and my available moves:

The position appears to be in the middle game with material roughly equal. As Black, I need to consider my development, king safety, and potential tactics.

Key observations:
- My king is on e8 with the rook on g8 (kingside)
- I have a bishop on g5 that seems active
- White has a knight on c3 and f3
- There's a pawn on e5 that could be important

Looking at my options, I see a few strategic choices:
1. Continue kingside castling with g8h8 or g8f8
2. Develop my queen with d8e7 or d8f6
3. Move my bishop on g5 to various squares
4. Make pawn advances

The most principled move appears to be to complete my kingside castling by moving my rook to f8, which would connect my rooks and improve my king safety.

- My king is still in the center (e8)
- White has a knight on d4 threatening my bishop on g5
- I should consider developing pieces and improving king safety

Among my options:
- Castling with f8g8 would improve king safety
- Moving the bishop on g5 to avoid the knight's threat
- Developing other pieces or advancing pawns

The most urgent issue is my king's safety, so I'll castle kingside.

After analyzing the position and my available moves, I can see I'm playing as Black and have several options. 

The position appears to be in the middle game with some material imbalance. I notice my bishop on g5 is active and could make a strong move. My king's position also needs consideration.

Looking at the most promising moves:
- The bishop on g5 has several good options, particularly g5e7 which would attack the White queen
- I could also develop my rook with g8f8 or protect my king with e8f8

I'll choose to move my bishop to e7, which attacks the White queen and develops my piece to a strong central position.

After analyzing the position and my legal moves, I see that I'm playing as Black and have several options. 

I notice my king is on e8, and I have a bishop on e7 that's being attacked by a white bishop on h4. My pawn structure is somewhat compromised with doubled pawns on the e-file (e5 and e7). White has a knight on d4 controlling several key squares.

Among my options:
- I could castle kingside with g8h8
- I could move my rook on g8
- I could move my bishop on e7 to safety
- I could advance my pawns

Castling seems like a good priority for king safety, so I'll make that move.

After analyzing the position and my legal moves, I can see that:

1. My king is on e8 with the rook on h8 still in place, so castling kingside is an option (e8g8)
2. I have a bishop on e7 that could develop
3. I have several pawn moves available

Given that my king safety is important and White seems to have some pieces developed, I'll castle kingside to protect my king.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

I apologize for the confusion. It seems I misinterpreted the board notation. Let me check the legal moves again and make a valid move.

Looking at the legal moves list, I see that "e8g8" isn't actually available, which means I can't castle kingside. Let me review the position more carefully.

Let me choose a strong move from the available legal moves. The bishop on e7 has several good options for development.

- My king is on e8 with limited development
- I have a bishop on f6 that appears active
- White has a rook on c3 and knights on d4 and g1
- I need to continue development and ensure king safety

Looking at the legal moves, I should prioritize:
1. King safety - potentially castling if available
2. Developing my pieces
3. Controlling the center

I see that I can castle kingside with "h8g8" which would improve my king's safety and connect my rooks.

- White has a rook on c3 and knights on d4 and h5
- There's a pawn on e5 that could be vulnerable

Looking at my options, I see several strong candidates:
1. Castling kingside with `g8h8` would improve my king safety
2. Moving my bishop from f6 could attack something or improve its position
3. Advancing my d7 pawn could help control the center

After consideration, I believe castling is the most urgent priority to improve my king's safety.

After analyzing the position, I see several key factors:

1. I have two bishops - one on f6 that's quite active and another on b8
2. My queen is on d8 and can potentially become more active
3. White has a rook on c4 that's somewhat active
4. My king safety seems reasonable with castling still available

Looking at my options, I think I should improve my position by developing pieces and potentially preparing to castle. The bishop on f6 is already well-placed, controlling important diagonals.

I'll castle kingside to improve my king's safety and connect my rooks:

After analyzing the position, I see several good options as Black. 

I notice my king is on g8 with a rook on h8, and I have a bishop on f6 that could be developed. My queen is on d8, and I have some pawn structure to consider.

The most principled move here appears to be developing my queen to e8 or f8, connecting my rooks. This would improve my piece coordination and prepare for potential counterplay.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

After analyzing the position, I see I'm playing as Black and have several options. The position appears to be in the middle game with some pieces already exchanged.

I notice my king is on g8, and I have a bishop on f6 that seems to be well-positioned. My queen is on e8, and I have a rook on h8. The pawn structure shows I have pawns on a7, b7, d7, and e5.

Looking at my options, I should prioritize king safety and piece activity. The bishop on f6 is well-placed, controlling important diagonals. My queen on e8 could be developed to a more active square.

I'll play:

make_move e8e5

This move:
1. Activates my queen by moving it to the center
2. Controls important central squares
3. Puts pressure on White's position
4. Maintains flexibility for future plans

The queen on e5 will be well-positioned to support potential attacks while maintaining defensive capabilities.

3. My king is on g8 with a rook on h8

Looking at tactical opportunities, I notice my queen on e5 can attack the knight on f4, which appears to be undefended. This would win material.

Looking at the position more carefully, I see that White's king is on d1 with limited protection. My queen on f4 can potentially create threats against the king. One particularly strong move is to bring my queen to d4, where it attacks the white rook on d4 while maintaining pressure toward White's king.

Looking at the position, I see an opportunity to improve my queen's position while maintaining pressure on White. The e5 square looks particularly attractive as it controls important central squares and puts pressure on White's position.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

After analyzing the position, I see several promising options. I notice my queen on e4 has many possible moves, and I also have two bishops that could be developed.

Looking at the position more carefully, I see that my queen on e4 can attack the white king on d1 with a check by moving to e1. However, this move isn't in the legal moves list, suggesting the king must actually be on d4.

Given the legal moves available, I'll play a strong move with my queen to put pressure on White's position:

make_move e4d4

This move directly attacks the white king, forcing a response. It's a check that will limit White's options and potentially lead to a favorable position for me.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

After analyzing the position and legal moves, I can see I'm playing as Black and have several strong options. 

I notice my queen on d4 is active and can potentially create threats. I also have two bishops (on b8 and f6) and my king on g8 appears to be safe. There's a pawn on e3 that could be advanced.

Looking at the most promising moves:

1. Queen moves: The queen on d4 has many options. Moving to e4 would attack White's king directly, but there might be defenses.
2. Bishop moves: The bishop on f6 has several diagonal options.
3. Pawn advance: e3-d2 would be a pawn push threatening promotion.

The pawn on e3 is very advanced and threatening to promote, so pushing it to d2 seems particularly strong, putting immediate pressure on White.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

After analyzing the position and my legal moves, I see that I'm playing as Black with a material advantage. I have two bishops and two rooks against White's lone king. 

I notice my king is on g8, and I have several good options. One of the strongest moves would be to bring my bishop on f6 closer to White's king to help set up a checkmate. The move Bf6-g7 looks particularly strong as it controls important squares around White's king while maintaining my bishop's activity.

After analyzing the position and my legal moves, I can see that:

1. I'm playing as Black and have a material advantage (two rooks, two bishops, and several pawns)
2. My king is on g8 with some potential moves
3. I have a bishop on g7 that has a long diagonal open
4. I have a rook on b8 that could be developed

Looking at my options, I notice my bishop on g7 has good mobility along the long diagonal. I can use this piece to increase my activity and potentially create threats.

I'll play the bishop move g7-e5, which develops the piece to a more active central square, controls important central squares, and puts pressure on White's position.

- My bishop on e5 is particularly active and has many possible moves
- White has advanced some pawns, including one to a6 that's quite forward

Among my options, I notice my dark-squared bishop on e5 has excellent mobility. I'll use it to create a tactical threat by moving it to g3, which attacks White's position and potentially creates threats against the white king on c3.

I notice my bishop on g3 has several strong diagonal moves available. The most active and threatening move appears to be:

make_move g3e5

This places my bishop on e5, controlling important central squares and creating pressure along the a1-h8 diagonal. This move improves my piece activity and could potentially threaten White's position.

Now I understand the position. I'm playing as Black and my king is on g8 with a rook on b8. White has a queen on c8 which is putting my king in check. I need to address this immediately.

Looking at my legal moves:
- g8h7: Move king to h7
- g8g7: Move king to g7
- g8f7: Move king to f7
- b8c8: Capture the white queen with my rook

The best move here is clearly to capture the white queen with my rook. This eliminates the immediate check and removes White's strongest piece.

After analyzing the position, I see several promising options:

1. I have a bishop on e5 with multiple attacking possibilities
2. My king is on g8 with the rooks on c8 and h8
3. I have a pawn on d5 that can capture or advance

The most active move appears to be capturing with the bishop on e5. Looking at the diagonal, I can capture on g7, which would be a strong attacking move.

Now I can see all my legal moves. Let me analyze the position:

1. I have material advantage with a rook, bishop, and several pawns versus White's few pawns
2. My king is safe on g8
3. I have active pieces that can be used to attack

Looking at the most promising moves:
- I could capture White's e4 pawn with d5xe4
- I could advance my c7 pawn to c5 to create more space
- I could use my bishop to attack White's d4 pawn with Bg7xd4
- I could move my rook to more active positions

The bishop capture Bg7xd4 looks particularly strong as it wins a pawn and activates my bishop. This would increase my material advantage and put more pressure on White's position.

I notice my bishop on g1 has excellent diagonal control and can make several strong moves. The most impactful move appears to be:

make_move g1d4

This places my bishop on d4, creating a powerful central presence. This move:
1. Attacks White's pawn on a1
2. Controls important central squares
3. Creates potential threats against White's king position
4. Maintains good mobility for my bishop

This is a strong developing move that improves my piece activity and creates concrete threats.

2. My rooks on c8 and h8 are active

Looking at the position tactically, I notice my bishop on d4 can move to g7, which would protect my king and maintain control of the long diagonal. This seems like a solid defensive move that also maintains my bishop's activity.

Thank you for providing the legal moves. Now I can analyze the position and make a decision.

Looking at the position, I notice:
- I have two rooks and a bishop vs White's lone king
- My king is safe on g8
- I should be able to deliver checkmate with this material advantage

The most logical approach is to coordinate my pieces to trap White's king. Since White's king is on c1, I'll use my rook on c8 to control the c-file and restrict the king's movement.

I apologize for the error. Let me check the legal moves again and make a valid move.

- I could develop my bishop with g7f6 or g7e5
- I could improve my rook position with d8d7 or h8h7

Since I have a significant advantage, I should focus on coordinating my pieces for a checkmate. I'll move my bishop to e5, which controls important central squares and puts pressure on White's position.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

After analyzing the position and my legal moves, I can see I'm playing as Black with a significant material advantage. I have two rooks, a bishop, and some pawns against White's king and a few pawns.

I notice my bishop on c3 has several strong options, including a check on g7. Taking control of the long diagonal would be powerful. Additionally, my rooks on d8 and h8 are well positioned.

I'll play the bishop check, which forces White's king to move and strengthens my attacking position.

I need to carefully analyze this position as Black. Here's what I observe:

1. I'm playing as Black with a king on g8, a bishop on f8, a rook on h8, and pawns on a7 and d5
2. White has a queen on g5 which is threatening my king
3. White's king is on c1, and there are some pawns on the board

The most pressing issue is that White's queen on g5 is threatening my king. I need to address this immediately. Looking at my legal moves:

- Moving my rook doesn't help defend against the queen's threat
- Moving my king to g7 would be walking into a check
- I could block with my bishop by moving to g7
- I could also move my d5 pawn forward

The best move appears to be protecting my king with the bishop:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

I need to analyze this position carefully. 

I'm playing as Black and I see:
- My king is on g8 with a rook on h8
- I have a bishop on g7, pawns on a7, d5, and g7
- White has a king on c1, a queen on h5, and pawns on a5, c3, and g5

The position looks quite tense. My king's safety is a priority, and I need to consider potential threats from White's queen.

Looking at my legal moves:
- Moving my rook (h8h7, h8h6)
- Moving my king (g8f8)
- Moving my bishop (g7f8, g7h6, g7f6, g7e5, g7d4, g7c3, g7b2, g7a1)
- Moving my pawn (d5d4)

The bishop on g7 is protecting my king from the queen on h5. Moving it would expose my king to check, so I should avoid those moves.

Moving my king to f8 seems reasonable to improve my king's safety and prepare for potential endgame play.

The position appears to be quite complex. I need to consider:
1. My king's safety
2. The activity of my pieces
3. Any immediate threats or opportunities

Looking at the board:
- White's queen on d2 could be a threat
- I have a bishop on g7 with a good diagonal
- My rook on h8 is not very active
- My king on f8 could potentially be safer on g8

One of the strongest moves appears to be moving my king to g8 with Kg8, which would:
1. Improve my king's safety by moving it to the corner
2. Connect my rook and king, improving coordination
3. Clear the f8 square for potential future use

I'm playing as Black and have a rook on h8, a king on f8, a bishop on g7, and a pawn on a7. White has a king on c1 and a queen on d1, with some pawns on the board.

Looking at my legal moves, I notice several key options:
- I can move my king to e8 or g8
- I can move my rook along the h-file or to g8
- I can move my bishop in several directions

The most pressing concern is my king's safety. Since White has a queen, I need to ensure my king is protected. Moving the king to g8 would put it next to my rook, creating a safer position.

I see the current position. This appears to be an endgame position where I'm playing as Black with a king (g8), rook (h8), bishop (g7), and a few pawns (a7, g7), while White has a king (c1) and queen (f1), along with some pawns.

Let me check what legal moves I have available.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

I can see my legal moves now. Let me analyze the position:

I have moves with my rook (h8) and bishop (g7). My king (g8) doesn't have any legal moves currently.

Looking at the position, I notice that:
1. My rook on h8 can move down the h-file
2. My bishop on g7 has several diagonal moves available

Since White has a queen, I need to be careful about potential threats. The most active piece I have is my rook, and keeping it on the h-file maintains pressure and control.

I'll move my bishop to f6, which improves its position, controls important central squares, and maintains protection of my kingside.

I need to analyze this endgame position carefully. 

I'm playing as Black with a king on g8, a rook on h8, and a bishop on f6. White has a king on c1 and a queen on f1, with some pawns on the board.

Looking at my legal moves, I notice my rook can move along the h-file, and my bishop has several diagonal options. My king can only move to f8 or g7.

The most pressing concern is defending against potential checkmate threats. White's queen on f1 is dangerous, and I need to maintain control.

The best move appears to be to keep my rook defending the back rank while maintaining the bishop's activity:

The most obvious and strongest move is to capture White's queen with my pawn:

1. King safety
2. Rook activity
3. Potential threats

Since White's knight on c8 is not directly threatening anything, I should use my rook actively. Moving the rook to the e-file would control more of the board and put pressure on White's position.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Now I understand my options. This is a critical endgame position where I need to make the best use of my rook and king.

Looking at the position, I notice that:
1. My rook on c8 is active and can potentially check the white king
2. My king on g8 is relatively safe
3. I have a passed pawn on b7 that's close to promotion
4. White has pawns on a6 and g6

The most powerful move here is to use my rook to check the white king while maintaining control of the promotion square for my b-pawn.

I'll push my pawn forward to continue its march toward promotion.

- I should try to advance this pawn while keeping my king active

Thank you for providing the legal moves. I see I have the following options:
- g8h7 (king moves to h7)
- g8g7 (king captures the white pawn on g7)
- g8f7 (king moves to f7)
- b4b3 (advance my pawn from b4 to b3)

I notice there's a discrepancy between the board display and the legal moves - the board shows my pawn on b5, but the legal moves suggest it's on b4.

Analyzing the position:
1. White's pawn on g7 is an immediate threat as it's about to promote
2. My pawn on b4/b5 is too far away to promote quickly

The best move is clearly to capture White's pawn:

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Now I understand my options. This is a critical endgame position where both sides are trying to promote their pawns.

Looking at the position:
1. My king is on g7, far from the queenside where the pawn action is happening
2. White's king is on a2, right next to their pawn on a3
3. My pawn is on b4 and can advance to b3

The key strategic decision is whether to:
- Move my king toward the queenside to support my pawn
- Push my pawn immediately to b3

Since my pawn is already advanced to b4 and can move to b3, I should push it forward. This forces White to make a decision about capturing my pawn or pushing their own. If White captures my pawn, their king moves away from their own pawn, giving me a chance to approach it.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

I see my legal moves now. I have king moves in various directions and I can also advance my pawn from b3 to b2.

This is a critical position in a pawn endgame. Looking at the board, White's pawn on a7 is very advanced and threatening to promote. My pawn on b3 is also advancing but is not as far along.

The key principle in such positions is to calculate who can queen their pawn first, and whether the opponent's king can stop it. My pawn is closer to queening (needs 2 more moves) than White's pawn (needs 1 more move), but I need to check if I can stop White's pawn while advancing mine.

Given that White's king is on b1, it's perfectly positioned to support the b-pawn promotion. Meanwhile, my king on g7 is too far away to stop White's a-pawn.

The best move is to advance my pawn immediately to create a queening threat that White must respond to:

I see the position now. We have a very simplified endgame with just kings and pawns. I'm playing as Black with my king on g7 and a pawn on b7. White has a king on a6 and a pawn on a7.

Let me check what legal moves I have available.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

I see my legal moves now. This is a critical position where I need to make the right decision.

Looking at the board, I have my pawn on b2 which is just one step away from promotion. This is clearly my winning chance. My king is on g7, far from the action, while White's king is on a6 and White's pawn is on a7.

The best move is to promote my pawn to a queen:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Looking at this position, I need to make a critical decision. White's pawn on a7 is about to promote to a queen, which would be devastating. I need to either capture that pawn or checkmate White immediately.

Analyzing the legal moves:
- My queen on b1 can move to b7 to attack the pawn
- I should check if I can deliver checkmate with my queen

The white king is on a5, and my queen can deliver check from b5. Let me see if this is a checkmate scenario...

From b5, the white king would only be able to move to a4, a6, or b6. If I place my queen on b5, the king can't escape to b4 or b6 because my queen controls those squares. It can move to a4 or a6, but then I can follow with Qb4# or Qb6#.

Actually, I notice I can deliver an immediate checkmate with Qb5#. The white king on a5 has no escape squares since my queen controls b4, b6, and a6, and a4 is off the board.

Now I have a clear picture of the position and my available moves. 

This is an endgame position where I'm playing as Black with my king on g7 and queen on b5 (not b6 as I initially thought). White has a king on a2 and a dangerous pawn on a7 that's about to promote.

My priority is to stop the pawn from promoting while maintaining control of the position. I can do this by moving my queen to b7, which directly attacks the pawn and prevents its promotion.

3. I need to either capture the pawn or prevent its promotion

The most direct approach is to capture the pawn with my queen:

I'll develop my kingside bishop to g7, which is a standard move in many openings. This will strengthen my control of the center, prepare for kingside castling, and put pressure along the long diagonal.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

I can see all my legal moves now. Let me analyze the position:

1. I notice I have the opportunity to castle kingside with e8g8 (O-O), which would improve my king safety.
2. White has developed a knight to c3 and pushed some pawns, but hasn't created immediate threats.
3. I have my knights developed to f6 and b8, and my dark-squared bishop is on g7.
4. My king is still in the center, which is generally unsafe in the middlegame.

Given these observations, castling kingside is a strong move that will improve my king safety and connect my rooks. This is typically a priority in the opening/early middlegame.

I'll make a developing move by bringing my knight to c6, which improves my control of the center and prepares for further development.

Let me analyze the position and make a strategic move as Black.

I notice I'm playing as Black and the position appears to be in the early-middle game. Looking at the available moves, I need to consider development, king safety, and potential tactics.

Some key observations:
- My king is on g8 with a rook on f8
- I have knights on c6 and f6, which are well developed
- My dark-squared bishop is on g7 and light-squared bishop on f7
- I have a pawn on e5 that could be advanced or protected

Among the candidate moves:
- Knight moves like f6e4 could be aggressive but need to ensure it's not a trap
- Castling (g8h8) would complete my king's safety
- Developing moves like f8e8 could connect my rooks

After evaluation, I'll make my move:

3. I notice my queen is under attack by White's bishop on f1
4. I have several knights and bishops developed, but need to address the queen threat

Since my queen on d8 is under attack by White's bishop on f1, I should move it to safety. Among the legal moves, I have options like d8e7 or d8e8.

Moving to e7 would develop the queen to a more active square while getting out of the attack.

I notice my king is on g8 with the rook on a8, and I have both knights developed. The pawn structure shows I have an advanced e5 pawn, and my queen is on e7.

Looking at the most active possibilities:
- I could develop my light-squared bishop with Bf8-e7
- I could advance my e5 pawn to e4, increasing central control
- I could improve my knight position with Nf6-d5 or Nc6-d4
- I could castle queenside with Kg8-e8 (since regular castling isn't available in the legal moves)

The move Nd4 (c6d4) looks particularly strong as it puts pressure on the center and attacks White's territory. This knight will be well-positioned on d4.

One of the most active moves would be to play Nd4-f3+, which would give check to the white king while attacking the white queen on d1 simultaneously - a fork that would win material.

You are a professional chess player and you play as black. Now is your turn to make a move. Before making a move you can pick one of the following actions:
- 'get_current_board' to get the schema and current status of the board
- 'get_legal_moves' to get a UCI formatted list of available moves
- 'make_move <UCI formatted move>' when you are ready to complete your turn (e.g., 'make_move e2e4')

I'll analyze the position and make a strong move as Black.

Looking at the board, I notice several key aspects:
- I have my knights well-positioned, especially the one on f3 which is putting pressure on White's position
- My queen on e7 is active but could be better placed
- The pawn on e5 is controlling central squares

Among my options, I see a strong tactical opportunity with my knight on f3, which is deep in White's territory. The knight on f3 can attack White's queen on d4 while also threatening the rook on h2.

- My king is on g8 with the rook on a8 and h8
- My queen is on c5, which is quite active
- White has a knight on b3 that's attacking my queen
- I have two knights on e6 and f6 in good central positions

One of the strongest moves I see is to move my queen to capture the bishop on h5, which would win material:

Player_Black (to Proxy):

I apologize for the error. Let me check the board again. It seems I misread the position. There is no bishop on h5 for my queen to capture. Let me look at the legal moves again and make a proper decision.

Looking at the legal moves list, I see that my queen on c5 has several options. Since the knight on b3 is attacking my queen, I should either move the queen or capture something valuable.

One strong move would be to capture the pawn on h5, which appears to be undefended:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

I apologize for the confusion. Let me carefully re-examine the board and the legal moves list.

Looking at the legal moves list again, I don't see "c5h5" as an option, which explains the error. Let me select a strong move from the actual legal moves available.

Since my queen on c5 is under attack from the knight on b3, I should move it to a safe square while maintaining activity. From the legal moves list, moving the queen to d4 looks strong - it attacks the d3 pawn and maintains central influence:

Looking at my options, I notice my queen on d4 has many possible moves. I should consider both attacking opportunities and safety. One strong move would be to attack White's queen on e1 while maintaining control of the center.

After analyzing the position and available moves, I notice I have my queen on e3 with many possible moves, and my king is on g8. The position appears to be in the middle game with some pieces already exchanged.

I see a strong move with my queen that can put pressure on White's position. I'll move my queen to f2, which threatens the white king and creates multiple threats.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

After analyzing the position and my available moves, I see several key considerations:

1. My king on g8 is relatively safe, but I should consider improving its position
2. I have two knights on e6 and f6 that could be developed better
3. My bishop on g7 is well placed on the long diagonal
4. There's a pawn on e5 that could advance

Looking at the tactical elements, I notice that my knight on f6 has some good outposts available, particularly e4 which would put pressure in the center.

I'll make a move with my knight to e4, which improves my piece activity and puts pressure in the center of the board:

One strong move would be to develop my knight on e6 to c5, where it attacks White's pawn on d3 and also controls important central squares.

The knight on e4 is particularly strong and can make some tactical moves. Moving it to f2 would fork the white king on e2 and rook on h1, which is a powerful tactic.

I'm playing as Black and I notice several key aspects of the position:
- I have a knight on e4 that's quite active in the center
- White's king is on e3, which could be vulnerable
- I have some pressure on the kingside

After evaluating the options, I see that my knight on e4 has several strong moves. The most attractive one is e4f2+, which would give a check to the White king and also fork the rook on d1.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Thank you for providing the legal moves. Let me analyze the position:

I notice I'm playing as Black and have several interesting options. Looking at the board:
- My king is on g8
- I have a knight on f2 that's quite active in White's territory
- There appears to be some pressure on the kingside

Among my options, the knight on f2 has several strong moves. Since it's already deep in White's territory, I should capitalize on this advantage.

The move f2d3 looks particularly strong as it attacks White's king on e5 while maintaining the knight in a central, protected position.

- My king is on g8 with some pawn protection
- I have a knight on d3 that's deep in White's territory
- White has knights on e4 and f5, and a bishop on h6
- I need to consider both attacking opportunities and defensive needs

Among my options:
- Knight moves from d3 could attack pieces or create threats
- King moves to improve safety
- Pawn advances to develop my position

After evaluation, I think the knight on d3 is my most active piece and can create the strongest threats.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

I need to analyze the position carefully before making my move.

Looking at the board, I see that:
- I'm playing as Black with my king on g8
- White has a knight on e5 attacking my f7 pawn
- White has another knight on f6 which is a strong outpost
- I have a knight on f4 with several possible moves
- My bishop on g7 is pinned to my king by White's bishop on h6

The most pressing issue is the knight on f6, which is very strong and restricting my position. I should consider capturing it with my f7 pawn.

The move f7xg6 would:
1. Remove the strong knight on f6
2. Open up my bishop on g7
3. Create a more solid pawn structure

This looks like the best move in the position.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

I'll analyze the position and my available moves:

The position is complex with material appearing roughly equal. I'm playing as Black and need to make a strategic decision.

Key observations:
- My king on g8 is somewhat exposed with pieces around it
- I have a knight on f4 that's actively placed in White's territory
- White has knights on e4 and f6, and a bishop on h7
- My pawn structure has some weaknesses, including a White pawn on c7

Looking at my options, I see several promising moves:

1. Knight moves from f4 - particularly f4e6 which attacks White's king area
2. King moves to improve safety
3. Pawn advances to create counterplay

The knight on f4 is very active and can create threats. Moving it to e6 would attack White's king position while maintaining a strong central presence.

I'll make this move:

Looking at the position, I see that White has a knight on e5 and the f-file is open. Moving my king to e8 would be safer than f8 since it gets away from the open file and potential threats.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

I see the current position and my legal moves. Let me analyze the situation:

1. I notice I have the option to castle kingside with "e8g8" since my king is on e8 and my rook is on h8
2. I have a knight on e6 with several possible moves
3. I have a bishop on g7 that can move to f8 or f6
4. I have several pawn moves available

Castling is often a priority as it brings the king to safety and connects the rooks. In this position, my king appears exposed in the center, and castling would improve my king's safety.

After analyzing the position and my available moves, I see several key considerations:

1. My king is on g8 and can move to safer squares
2. I have a knight on e6 with multiple options
3. I have pawn moves available

The position appears to be in the middlegame with material roughly equal. My king safety is important, and I should consider developing my pieces effectively.

I'll move my knight on e6 to c5, which puts pressure on White's d3 pawn and improves my knight's position to a more central and active square.

Looking at the position strategically, I notice my knight on c5 is well-positioned and has several good options. The e4 square looks particularly attractive as it would put pressure on White's position and potentially fork pieces.

- White has a bishop on g4 and a knight on h4
- My pawn structure has some weaknesses with doubled pawns on the g-file

The knight on e4 is my most active piece and could potentially fork pieces or create threats. Looking at the knight moves, e4f2 stands out as it would attack White's king on e5 and potentially another piece.

I'll make this move:

3. I need to improve my position and potentially activate my pieces

Among my options:
- Knight moves (f2 to various squares) could be active
- I could develop my bishop on g7 to f8 or f6
- King moves are available but not urgent
- Several pawn moves are possible

The knight on f2 is my most active piece, and I should use it to create threats or improve its position. The move f2-e4 looks particularly strong as it:
- Centralizes my knight
- Attacks White's pawn on c3
- Controls important central squares

- My king is on g8 with a rook on a8
- I have a knight on c3 that has multiple options
- White has a bishop on e5 threatening my knight
- The pawn structure shows I'm playing a Sicilian-type position

Looking at my legal moves, I need to prioritize safety and development. The knight on c3 is under attack by the bishop on e5, so I should either move it or defend it.

The knight move c3e4 looks particularly strong as it:
1. Escapes the bishop's attack
2. Attacks the center
3. Creates a potential fork threat

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Thank you for providing the legal moves. Let me analyze the position:

I'm playing as Black and I notice several key aspects of the position:
- My king is on g8 with the rook on a8 and h8
- I have a knight on e4 that appears to be active in the center
- White has a bishop on e5 that's attacking my position
- There's a white knight on h4

Looking at my options, I see some promising moves:

1. The knight on e4 has several good options, particularly e4f2 which would fork White's king and rook
2. I could develop with moves like g7f6 (bishop development)
3. I could make a kingside move like g8f8

The knight fork with e4f2 looks particularly strong as it threatens both White's king on g1 and rook on b1.

1. My king is on g8 with some pawn shelter
2. I have a knight on f2 that's actively placed in White's territory
3. White has a bishop on e5 threatening my g7 bishop
4. I need to consider both defense and counterplay

The knight on f2 is particularly strong and can make several good moves. I think the most impactful move is to attack White's rook on b2 with my knight.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Let me analyze the position and my available moves:

I notice I'm playing as Black and the position is quite complex. Looking at the board:
- My king is on g8
- I have a knight on d3 that has several potential moves
- I have pawns that can advance
- My bishop on g7 can move to f8 or f6

Among my options:
- The knight on d3 is very active in White's territory and has many possible moves
- I could develop my king position with king moves
- I could advance pawns to gain space

After evaluating the position, I think my knight on d3 is well-placed and can create threats. The move d3f4 looks particularly strong as it attacks White's position while maintaining my knight's activity.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

I see that I have two legal moves as Black:

1. f4g6: Moving my knight from f4 to g6
2. h7g6: Moving my pawn from h7 to g6

Let me analyze the position:

I notice that White has a knight on g7 that's threatening my position. My knight on f4 can capture this knight by moving to g6, which would eliminate this threat. This seems like a strong tactical move as it removes White's advanced piece.

The alternative is to move my pawn from h7 to g6, but this doesn't capture anything and would leave White's knight on g7 still active.

The knight capture is clearly the better option as it removes White's attacking piece.

Looking at the position critically, I notice White has a rook on b5 that's quite active, and another rook on h1. My king safety is important, and I should consider developing my pieces effectively.

One of the strongest moves appears to be developing my bishop on g7 with a check:

- White has a rook on b2, a bishop on h3, and another rook on h1
- I'm playing as Black with my king on g8
- There's a knight on g6 that could be developed
- My pawn structure needs attention, especially with the white pawn on c7

One of my strongest moves would be to develop my bishop to g7, which would control the long diagonal and protect my king. This is a standard fianchetto position that provides good king safety and diagonal control.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

After analyzing the position, I can see I'm playing as Black with my king on g8. White has a rook on b2, a bishop on h3, and the white king is on g2. 

I notice several key factors:
- My knight on g6 is active and can make several moves
- My bishop on g7 is well positioned on the long diagonal
- I have a pawn on e5 that can advance
- My king safety is important to consider

Among my options, advancing the e-pawn looks strong as it gains space and could potentially become a passed pawn later:

Looking at my options, I should address the most pressing issues. The white rook on e5 is quite active, and I should consider my defensive resources.

One strong move is to develop my bishop from c8 while gaining tempo:

1. My king on g8 is relatively safe
2. I have two bishops (b7 and g7) and a knight (g6) actively placed
3. There's a pawn on e4 that could be advanced

Looking at my options, I think developing my bishop from b7 to c6 would be a strong move. This:
- Increases my control of the center
- Puts pressure on White's pawn structure
- Improves my piece coordination

I notice my king is on g8, and I have two bishops (on c6 and g7), a knight on g6, and various pawns. White has a rook on e5 that could be threatening, and their king is on g1.

One of my strongest moves appears to be my dark-squared bishop on g7, which is aiming at White's queenside. I can play:

make_move g7c3

This move attacks White's pawn on a1 while developing my bishop to a more active square. It puts pressure on White's position and could potentially win material if White doesn't respond properly.

One of my strongest pieces is the bishop on e5, which is attacking diagonally and has good mobility. I should consider using this piece effectively.

The move e5g3 looks particularly strong as it:
1. Attacks White's kingside
2. Creates a fork threat against White's king and potentially other pieces

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

After analyzing the position, I see I'm playing as Black and I need to make a move. 

I notice that:
- My king is on g8 with the rook on a8 (castling is no longer possible)
- I have a bishop on c6 and a knight on g6
- White has a knight on d7 threatening my bishop
- White has a rook on e5 and another on h1, plus a bishop on h6

Looking at my legal moves, I need to address the threat to my bishop on c6. I could move the bishop to several squares, but I want to maintain its activity.

The move c6d5 looks strong as it maintains the bishop on a good diagonal while attacking White's rook on e5.

Let me analyze the position:

I'm playing as Black and I see I have a rook on a8 and h8, my king on g8, a knight on g6, and a bishop on d5. White has a knight on d7, a bishop on e5, rooks on e5 and h1, and the white king on h2.

Looking at the legal moves, I notice:
- My bishop on d5 is attacking White's rook on e5
- My knight on g6 has several options but doesn't immediately threaten anything valuable
- I need to be careful about the knight on d7 which is forking my rooks

The most pressing issue is the knight fork on d7. I should capture the rook on e5 with my bishop, which is a free piece.

I'm playing as Black and the position looks complex. I notice:
- My king is on g8 with a rook on a8
- White has a knight on d7 threatening my position
- I have a bishop on e6 and a knight on g6
- White has a rook on e5 and another on h1, with the white king on g3

Looking at my legal moves, I need to address several threats. The knight on d7 is particularly dangerous as it's deep in my territory.

My bishop on e6 can capture that knight with e6d7, which would remove an immediate threat. This seems like a strong move as it eliminates a dangerous piece that's infiltrated my position.

I notice I have a bishop on d7, a knight on g6, and my king on g8. White has a rook on f3 and the white king is on g1. 

One strong move would be to develop my bishop to e6, which would control important central squares and prepare for potential counterplay.

I notice several strong options:
1. My bishop on e6 has good diagonals
2. My knight on g6 can make some interesting moves
3. My e4 pawn is advanced and could be pushed

After evaluating the position, I'll make a move with my bishop to control more of the board and potentially create threats.

Looking at the position, I notice I have a tactical opportunity. My bishop on f5 is attacking along the h3-c8 diagonal. I can deliver a check to the white king by moving the bishop to h3.

The bishop on h3 is particularly well-positioned, controlling the diagonal and putting pressure on the white position. I'll make a move with this bishop to increase my attacking chances.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

I need to analyze this position carefully. 

I see that I'm playing as Black and have several pieces: king on g8, rooks on a8 and h8, knight on g6, bishop on f5, and pawns on a7, e4, and h6. White has a king on g1, rooks on b2 and h1, a pawn on a4, and a pawn on c3.

Looking at the position, I notice:
1. My bishop on f5 is attacking along the a8-h1 diagonal
2. My knight on g6 has several potential moves
3. My king is safe for now

One strong move would be to use my bishop to attack White's position. The bishop on f5 can move to g4, putting pressure on White's position.

After analyzing the position and my legal moves, I see several key considerations:

1. My king is in the corner with a white rook on h1 potentially threatening a back-rank mate
2. My a7 pawn is under attack by the white rook on b7
3. I have active pieces with my bishop on g4 and knight on g6

Looking at my options, I notice I can move my king to f8, which would both escape any potential back-rank threats and protect my rook on a8. This seems like a solid, developing move that improves my king's position.

2. White has a rook on b7 that's attacking my a7 pawn
3. My bishop on g4 is active and could potentially deliver a check
4. My knight on g6 has several good options

The most promising move appears to be using my bishop to deliver a check to White's king:

make_move g4e2

This move:
- Delivers check to the White king on h1
- Moves my bishop to a safe square
- Maintains control of key diagonals
- Forces White to respond to the check rather than executing their own plans

4. I have rooks on a8 and f8 that could be better coordinated

One of my strongest moves appears to be developing my bishop with e2f3, which attacks the white king on h1 and improves my piece activity. This puts immediate pressure on White and creates tactical threats.

White has a rook on b7, pawns on a4 and c3, and the white king is on h7.

This is a complex position with several tactical possibilities. My king on h8 is in check from the white rook on b7 along the 7th rank. I need to address this check immediately.

Looking at my legal moves, I have three main options to deal with the check:
1. Move my king to g8
2. Block with my rook by moving f8 to f7
3. Capture the checking rook (not possible here)

The safest and best move appears to be moving my king to g8, which gets out of check while maintaining my defensive position.

I notice that White has a rook on b7 which is threatening my a7 pawn. My king's position seems relatively safe at the moment, but I should be careful.

Looking at my options, I see a potential strong move with my bishop from h1. The bishop on h1 can move to f3, which would attack White's king on g3. This creates an immediate threat.

g8h8,g8g7

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

I can see that I'm playing as Black and I'm in a critical position. Looking at the board:

1. My king is on g8 with only two legal moves: g8h8 or g8g7
2. White has a rook on g7 threatening my king
3. I have a bishop on f5 and a knight on g7
4. White's king is on g5

This is clearly a check situation with very limited options. Let me evaluate my two possible moves:

- g8h8: Moving to the corner might seem safe, but after analyzing the position, this would likely lead to checkmate soon as my king would be confined.
- g8g7: This would capture White's rook on g7, removing the immediate threat.

The best move is to capture the rook that's checking me.

1. I have a bishop on f3 that's active and could potentially attack the white king on h1
2. My knight on g6 has mobility
3. I have rooks on a8 and f8 that could be developed

Given that the white king is on h3 and my bishop is on f3, I can deliver a check by moving the bishop to h5.

3. My king is on g7, and I have a rook on a8 and f8, a knight on g6, and a bishop on h1

Looking at the legal moves, I notice I have several strong options:

- I could play h1f3 with my bishop, attacking White's position
- I could consider moving my rook on f8 to improve its position
- My knight on g6 has several good squares

After analyzing the position, I'll make a move with my bishop from h1 to f3, which puts pressure on White's position and controls important central squares.

One of my strongest moves would be to connect my rooks with `f8g8`, improving my king safety and preparing for potential counterplay on the kingside.

Let me analyze this position carefully:

1. I'm playing as Black and my king is on g7
2. White's queen is on c2 and king on h1
3. I have a knight on g6, a bishop on f3, and rooks on a8 and g8
4. There's a pawn structure to consider

Looking at the position, I notice my bishop on f3 has good diagonals. It's currently attacking the h1 square where White's king is located. This suggests a potential checkmate opportunity.

I'll make the move to capture White's king:

Player_Black (to Proxy):

I see the current position and my legal moves. Let me analyze the situation:

1. I'm playing as Black and my king is on g7
2. White's queen is on c7, which is putting pressure on my position
3. My legal moves are:
   - g7h8 (King to h8)
   - g7f8 (King to f8)
   - g7f6 (King to f6)
   - g6e7 (Knight to e7)

Looking at the position, I need to prioritize my king's safety. The white queen on c7 is threatening my position, and I need to make sure my king is safe.

Moving my king to f8 (g7f8) seems most prudent as it gets away from the edge of the board and maintains more escape squares. Moving to h8 would corner my king, which is generally not advisable. Moving to f6 could potentially walk into threats from white pieces.

I'll make my move:

Player_Black (to Proxy):

I need to carefully analyze this position. As Black, I'm facing a challenging situation with White's queen on h7 threatening my position.

Key observations:
- White's queen on h7 is threatening my king on f8
- I have a bishop on h1 and a knight on g6
- There's a pawn on e4 that could advance
- My king is on f8 with a rook on a8

Looking at my legal moves, I need to address the immediate threat. The queen on h7 is putting pressure on my king, so I should prioritize safety.

The strongest move appears to be moving my king to e8, which gets out of the queen's direct attack and maintains control of the center:

3. I have a bishop on h1 and a knight on g6

I notice several key aspects:
- White's queen on b7 is threatening my a7 pawn
- My king on f8 is relatively safe for now
- I have an active bishop on h1 and knight on g6

Looking at my options:
1. The bishop on h1 can move to f3 or g2, with f3 putting pressure on White's position
2. I can move my rook on a8 to various squares
3. I can advance my e4 pawn to e3
4. My king can move to e8

After evaluation, I believe the strongest move is to activate my bishop by moving it to f3, where it controls important squares and puts pressure on White's position.

Thank you for providing the legal moves. Let me analyze the position more carefully:

I notice that I have a bishop on f3 that's directly attacking the white king on g3. This is a check situation, and White must address it on their next move.

Looking at my options:
- I could play Bh1, which maintains the check from a different angle
- I could play Bg4, which also maintains the check
- I could play Bg2, which maintains the check and controls important squares
- I could play Bh5, which moves the bishop to safety while controlling other squares

Given that my bishop is currently delivering check and is undefended, I should consider the best follow-up. The move Bg2 seems particularly strong as it maintains the check while controlling important squares.

I see a strong tactical opportunity here. I can deliver checkmate immediately with my bishop:

1. My bishop on h3 attacks the White king on g4
2. The king has no escape squares (f3, f4, f5, g5, h4, h5 are all covered or blocked)
3. There's no way for White to block the check or capture my bishop

I need to make a strong move here. The knight on g6 is well-positioned, controlling important squares. I notice my king on f7 is relatively safe, but I should consider improving my position.

One of the strongest moves would be to activate my rook on a8 by moving it to the open d-file where it can gain activity.

- My knight is on g6
- I have pawns on e4 and h5
- White's king is on g1 with a pawn on a3

Looking at the legal moves, I should aim to coordinate my pieces for checkmate or material gain. The most active move appears to be bringing my rook to the d-file where it controls important squares and maintains pressure.

After analyzing the position, I can see I'm playing as Black with a strong position. I have two rooks (one on d1 and one on g8), a knight on g6, my king on f7, and pawns on e4 and h5. White's king is on g7, quite exposed.

This looks like a winning position for me. I'll check for immediate tactical opportunities:

1. The rook on d1 can move up the d-file to attack - particularly d8 looks strong
2. My knight on g6 controls important squares
3. My king on f7 seems relatively safe

The most decisive move appears to be moving my rook to d8, creating a powerful threat along the 8th rank where I can potentially deliver checkmate.

After analyzing the position and legal moves, I'll make my decision as Black.

I notice several key factors:
- I have material advantage with two rooks and a knight vs White's lone bishop
- White's bishop is trapped on a8
- My king is safe on f6
- I should aim to advance my pawns toward promotion

The most straightforward winning plan is to push my e-pawn toward promotion while keeping control of the position. This will force White to deal with the pawn threat while I can improve my other pieces.

1. I notice there's a discrepancy in the board display and legal moves - the board shows my king on f6, but there's a legal move f7f6 which suggests my king might be on f7. I'll work with the legal moves list as the definitive source.

2. Looking at the position strategically:
   - I should consider improving my king position
   - I could potentially use my rooks more actively
   - My knight on g6 has several options

After evaluating my options, I'll play a rook move to improve its position and control more of the board.

I notice several strong options:
1. I can attack the white king with my knight: `g6e5+`
2. I can check with my rook: `d2f2+`
3. I can move my rook on the 8th rank to control more squares

Looking at the legal moves, I see that `g6e5` would be a knight fork, attacking both the white king and potentially the bishop. This is a very strong tactical move.

You are a professional chess player and you play as black. Now is your turn to make a move. Before making a move you can pick one of the following actions:
- 'get_current_board' to get the schema and current status of the board
- 'get_legal_moves' to get a UCI formatted list of available moves
- 'make_move <UCI formatted move>' when you are ready to complete your turn (e.g., 'make_move e2e4')

After analyzing the position, I can see that I'm playing as Black with a king on f7, a rook on g8, another rook on d2, a knight on e5, and pawns on h5 and e3. White has a king on e4 and a bishop on b7.

I notice I have a very strong move available - I can checkmate White immediately with my rook from d2 to d4, delivering a checkmate since the White king on e4 would be attacked with no legal escape squares.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Looking at the position, I need to make a strong move as Black. I notice several key elements:

1. I have a rook on g8, my king on f7, a knight on e5, and pawns on h5 and e3
2. White has a king on d4, a bishop on b7, and a pawn on h4

My knight on e5 is well-positioned, controlling several squares. I should consider:
- Advancing my e3 pawn which is close to promotion
- Using my rook to control the g-file or attack
- Protecting my king which seems relatively exposed

The most forcing move appears to be advancing my e-pawn:

The strongest move here is to promote my e2 pawn to a queen, which will give me a decisive material advantage.

I need to analyze this position carefully. I'm playing as Black and have several key pieces: a king on f7, a queen on e1, and a rook on g8. White has a king on e5, a bishop on e4, and a pawn on h5.

Looking at the legal moves, I notice a few important things:
1. My queen on e1 has many options
2. My rook on g8 can move along the 8th rank or down the g-file
3. My king on f7 has a few moves

The most critical observation is that I have a checkmate opportunity. My queen can deliver checkmate by moving to e4, capturing the bishop and delivering a check that the White king cannot escape.

I can see the current position. I'm playing as Black and have a queen on b6, a king on f7, and a rook on g8. White has a king on a6 and a pawn on h4.

Let me check what legal moves I have available.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Looking at this position, I have several strong options as Black. Since I have a material advantage with a queen and rook, my goal should be to force checkmate efficiently.

I notice that my queen on h3 can deliver check by moving to b3, which would force the white king to move. This would help me make progress toward checkmate.

- Black king on f6
- Black queen on b5
- Black rook on g7
- Black pawn on h4

White only has a king on a6.

Let me check what legal moves I have available.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

I notice there's some confusion in the move list compared to the board I was shown. The board shows a rook on g7, queen on b5, and pawn on h4, but the legal moves suggest different piece positions.

Based on the legal moves provided, it appears I have:
- A rook on g8
- A queen on b3
- A pawn on h5

Let me analyze the position and make a strong move. Since I have a material advantage, my goal should be to checkmate the white king efficiently.

The most direct approach would be to use my queen to deliver checkmate. Looking at the position, I can see that the white king is on a6.

I'll play:

make_move b3a4

This move puts the queen on a4, delivering checkmate as the white king on a6 has no legal moves. The king can't move to a5, b5, or b6 as those squares are controlled by my queen, and it can't move to a7 or b7 as those would still be in check from the queen.

I'll analyze the position:
1. I could capture the knight with Nxh5, but that would bring my knight to the edge of the board
2. I should continue development and protect against potential threats

One of the strongest moves here is to develop my knight to c6, which develops a piece, controls important central squares, and prepares for castling.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

After analyzing the position, I see that I'm playing as Black in what appears to be an early middlegame position. White has developed their kingside with a knight on h5 and a bishop on h7, while I have knights on c6 and h5.

I notice a few key considerations:
- My e5 pawn is advanced but could be vulnerable
- I should continue development of my pieces
- My king is still in the center and needs safety

One of the strongest moves here would be to develop my light-squared bishop to e7, which helps protect my king and prepares for castling. This is a natural developing move that improves my position.

Proxy (to Player_Black):

e8f8,e8d7,d8d7,c8d7

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Now I understand the situation better. I have only four legal moves:

1. e8f8 - Moving my king to the f8 square
2. e8d7 - Moving my king to d7 to capture White's bishop
3. d8d7 - Moving my queen to d7 to capture White's bishop
4. c8d7 - Moving my bishop to d7 to capture White's bishop

Looking at these options:
- e8f8 is just a king move that doesn't address the immediate threat
- e8d7 would capture the bishop but put my king in the center, which is dangerous
- d8d7 would capture the bishop with my queen, but might expose my queen to threats
- c8d7 would capture the bishop with my bishop, which is material-for-material

The best move is to recapture the bishop with my own bishop, maintaining material balance and keeping my queen and king safe.

I need to analyze the position carefully before making my move.

Looking at the board, I notice:
- I'm playing Black and have a standard pawn structure
- I have two bishops on d7 and e7, knights on c6 and h5
- White has a knight on h4 that's somewhat active
- I haven't castled yet, but I see the option e8g8 is available (kingside castling)

Castling is a priority in the opening/early middlegame to get my king to safety and connect my rooks. Since kingside castling is available, I'll take that opportunity.

Among my options, I think developing my pieces and improving my position is important. The move Nf6 (h5f6) looks particularly strong as it:
1. Develops the knight to a central square
2. Attacks White's g-pawn
3. Helps control the center

Player_Black (to Proxy):

After analyzing the position, I see several good options. I notice I have a well-developed position with both knights and bishops active.

Looking at the board, I see that my d4 pawn is advanced and could potentially be captured by White's g5 knight. I also notice that my knight on f6 has the opportunity to jump to e4, which would be a strong central square.

The move Ne4 (f6e4) looks particularly strong as it:
1. Attacks the center
2. Puts pressure on White's position
3. Develops my piece to an excellent central square
4. Could potentially threaten White's queen or other pieces depending on future developments

After analyzing the position and available moves, I'll make my decision.

I notice I have a knight on e4 that's quite active and can make several strong moves. I also see my bishop pair on d7 and e7 that could be developed. 

One of the most principled moves would be to develop my knight on e4 to a better square. The move e4f6 looks particularly strong as it develops the knight to a central outpost, controls important squares, and increases my piece activity.

Looking at the legal moves, I see several strong options:
- I could develop my dark-squared bishop with d7e6 or d7f5
- I could improve my knight position with c6e5 or f6e4
- I could make a prophylactic king move with g8h8

The knight on f6 to e4 looks particularly appealing as it would attack the center and potentially put pressure on White's position. This knight move would control important central squares and could threaten White's queen or other pieces depending on future developments.

I need to analyze this position carefully. 

I notice White has an active queen on e4 and a knight on h5, creating some pressure. My king is on g8, and I have two bishops on d7 and e7, plus a knight on c6.

Looking at the legal moves, I see several strong options:
- I could develop my bishop with e7g5, attacking White's queen
- I could move my knight to e5 with c6e5, creating central pressure
- I could protect against potential threats with g7g6

The most active and strong move appears to be e7g5, attacking White's queen immediately and gaining tempo. This forces White to move the queen and gives me initiative.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

After analyzing the position, I can see I'm playing as Black with a fairly developed position. I notice:

- My king is on g8 with rooks on c8 and e8
- I have bishops on d7 and g5
- I have a knight on f3 that's quite active
- White has a queen on e5 and a rook on g7 that appears to be threatening my position

One of my strongest pieces is the knight on f3, which is putting pressure on White's position. I should consider either improving its position or capitalizing on its current placement.

I'll make a move with my knight from f3 to e5, which attacks White's queen and improves my piece's position.

Looking at the legal moves, I see an opportunity to improve my position. The knight on e5 is well-placed, controlling several key squares. I should consider either improving my king's safety or developing an attack.

One strong move would be to centralize my queen with:

make_move d8d4

This places my queen in a powerful central position, putting pressure on White's position, potentially threatening pieces and creating tactical opportunities. From d4, the queen controls many squares and increases my attacking potential.

You are a professional chess player and you play as black. Now is your turn to make a move. Before making a move you can pick one of the following actions:
- 'get_current_board' to get the schema and current status of the board
- 'get_legal_moves' to get a UCI formatted list of available moves
- 'make_move <UCI formatted move>' when you are ready to complete your turn (e.g., 'make_move e2e4')

I'll play a strong move with my queen to increase the pressure:

I notice my queen on e4 is attacking the white queen on f3, and I can also see that my bishop on e3 is attacking the white queen on f3 as well. This creates a tactical opportunity.

The best move here is to capture the white queen with my bishop:

3. I have a knight on f5 and two bishops (f2 and e4)
4. White has a bishop on g4 that's threatening my position

One of my strongest moves appears to be using my queen to attack White's position. The move e5d3 looks particularly strong as it attacks White's queenside while maintaining my queen's activity.

I see a powerful move: I can play my queen to g1, which is a checkmate. The white king is trapped with no escape squares, and my queen would be delivering check with no way for White to block or capture.

I can see the current board position. It appears we're in the early opening phase of the game. White has moved their knight to a3 and pawn to g4, while as Black, we've developed our knight to c6, pushed pawns to e5 and h5, and have an open position for our queen's bishop.

Let me check what legal moves I have available.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Now I can see all my legal moves. Let me analyze the position and make a strategic decision.

Looking at the position:
1. We have good development opportunities
2. White has moved their knight to a3 (not an ideal square)
3. White has pushed g4, which creates some weaknesses

I should focus on development while taking advantage of White's slightly awkward setup. A few candidate moves:
- Developing the bishop with Bf8-e7 or Bf8-c5
- Developing the knight with Ng8-f6 or Ng8-e7
- Capturing the g4 pawn with h5xg4, though this might open the h-file

I think developing the knight to f6 is a strong classical move that controls the center and prepares for castling. This is a standard development move that puts pressure on the e4 square.

After analyzing the position and my available legal moves, I'll make a move.

The position appears to be in the early opening phase. As Black, I should focus on development and central control. I notice my knights are already developed, but my bishops and rooks need to get into the game.

I'll develop my dark-squared bishop with:

make_move f8e7

This is a solid developing move that:
1. Develops a piece toward the center
2. Protects my king
3. Connects my rooks
4. Maintains flexibility in my pawn structure

This is a standard developing move in many openings and helps me prepare for castling in the near future.

2. My knights are well developed at c6 and f6.
3. My dark-squared bishop is on e7, and my light-squared bishop is on e5.
4. White has a knight on a3 and has pushed some pawns on the kingside.

Castling kingside seems like the best move here as it:
- Improves my king's safety
- Connects my rooks
- Is a standard development move in many openings

I'll make this move:

I notice I have a fairly standard opening position as Black, with knights developed to c6 and f6, bishops on e7 and c8, and I've castled kingside. The e-pawn is advanced to e5.

One of the strongest moves in this position would be to develop my bishop from c8, which is currently trapped behind my pawns. I can also consider advancing my d-pawn to d5 to fight for central control.

I'll choose to advance my d-pawn to d5, which stakes a claim in the center and opens lines for my pieces, particularly the c8 bishop.

I notice my king is on g8, and I have several good developing options. My light-squared bishop on e7 has potential to be active, and my knights are already developed to c6 and f6.

I'll play a solid developing move that improves my bishop's position and prepares for potential kingside castling:

make_move c8e6

This develops my dark-squared bishop to a good diagonal, controls important central squares, and maintains flexibility in my position. The bishop on e6 will protect my d5 pawn and help control the center.

After analyzing the position and legal moves, I'll make a move.

I notice I have a well-developed position with knights on c6 and f6, bishops on e6 and e7, and my queen is active on d8. Looking at the available moves, I should continue development and improve my position.

One strong move would be to connect my rooks by moving my king to h8, which also gets it out of potential checks along the g-file.

After analyzing the position, I see I'm playing as Black with a fairly developed position. I notice my bishops are on e7 and e6, knights on c6 and f6, and queen on d8.

I'll consider a few strong candidate moves:
- Developing my rook with a8c8 (connecting rooks)
- Knight moves like f6e4 to attack the center
- Bishop moves like e7d6 to improve positioning
- Pawn advances to strengthen my position

The move e7d6 looks particularly appealing as it develops my bishop to a more active diagonal while maintaining protection of key squares.

Let me analyze the position and make a good move as Black.

I notice several key aspects of the position:
- I have two knights developed and my dark-squared bishop is active
- My king is on g8 with some pawn protection
- White's king is somewhat exposed on f3
- I have pressure in the center with my e5 pawn

Looking at the legal moves, I see some interesting tactical opportunities. The knight on f6 has several good options, including e4 which would attack White's king. I should also consider developing my remaining pieces and improving my position.

After careful consideration, I'll play the knight to e4, putting pressure on White's king and controlling important central squares.

After analyzing the position, I see several good options. I notice I have two knights (on c6 and e4) that can make active moves, and my queen on d8 has mobility.

The knight on e4 is particularly strong and can make several threatening moves. I also see that my d5 pawn is advanced and could be pushed.

I'll play a strong knight move that increases my control of the center and puts pressure on White's position:

One of the strongest moves here appears to be developing my knight on d4 to e6, which would:
1. Attack the c7 square (potentially threatening a fork)
2. Improve my knight's position to a more central square
3. Prepare for potential kingside play

One strong move would be to activate my knight on c5 by moving it to e4, which would put pressure on the center and potentially threaten White's pieces.

My king is on g8, and I notice my queen on d8 has several good options. I also have a bishop on d6 and a knight on e6 that could be developed better.

Looking at the position critically, I see that my e5 pawn is advanced and could be under threat. I should consider the safety of my king as well.

One strong move would be to connect my rooks by moving the queen, which also increases my control of the center. The move Qd8e8 accomplishes this while maintaining flexibility.

1. h8h7 - Moving my king from h8 to h7
2. h8g7 - Moving my king from h8 to g7
3. g8g7 - Moving my king from g8 to g7 (this seems incorrect as my king appears to be on h8)
4. f8g7 - Moving my bishop from f8 to g7

Looking at the board, I notice my king is on h8, and I have a bishop on f8. There seems to be a white bishop on g7 threatening my position. I need to address this immediate threat.

The move f8g7 would capture the white bishop on g7 with my bishop, removing an attacking piece and improving my position.

- White has a knight on e4 threatening my position
- I have pawns on d5 and e5 controlling the center

One strong move would be to activate my queen with a threat. The move Qd7f5 looks particularly strong as it:

1. I have a queen on f5 with many possible moves
2. I have a knight on e2 that could be active
3. My king on g8 is relatively safe

One of the strongest moves appears to be using my queen to attack the white king on e5. The move f5e6 would put the white king in check and apply significant pressure.

Looking at the available moves, I see an opportunity for a strong attack with my queen. I'll play:

make_move g4e2

This move attacks White's king with my queen, delivering check. It also threatens White's bishop on h7 if the king moves. This forces White to respond to the check, giving me the initiative and maintaining pressure on White's exposed king.

I need to analyze the position carefully before making my move.

Looking at the board:
- White has a rook on e5 that's attacking my e-pawn
- My knight on c3 is active and has several options
- White's king is on e3, somewhat exposed
- I have a bishop on g7 that could become more active

Among my options:
- Knight moves could be tactical
- I need to consider the safety of my king
- The e4 pawn is under attack

The knight move c3d5 looks particularly strong as it:
1. Attacks the white rook on e5
2. Creates a fork threat between the rook and potentially other pieces
3. Moves to a more central and influential square

Looking at the position critically:
1. My knight on d5 is very active and could potentially fork pieces
2. I have a pawn structure with pawns on e4 and e5, giving me space advantage in the center
3. My king on g8 is castled and relatively safe

One strong move would be to activate my knight with Nd5-f4, putting pressure on White's position and potentially threatening tactical opportunities.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Let me analyze the position and my available moves:

I see I'm playing as Black and the position appears to be in the middlegame. I have a knight on d5 that has several good options, including the strong outpost e3. My king is on g8 with a rook on a8 and another on h8. I have a bishop on g7 that's currently on the long diagonal.

Looking at the knight on d5, moving it to e3 looks particularly strong as it would fork White's king on d4 and rook on e5. This is a tactical opportunity I should capitalize on.

Let me analyze the position and make a strong move as Black.

I notice I have a knight on e3 that's quite active and could potentially create threats. I also see my bishop on g7 and rooks on a8 and h8 that could be developed.

Looking at the legal moves, I have several interesting options:
- Knight moves from e3 (like e3f5 or e3c4)
- Developing my bishop with g7f8
- Advancing pawns like f7f5
- King safety moves like g8f8

The knight on e3 is particularly strong and can create threats. Moving it to f5 would attack White's position and potentially threaten a fork.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

I need to analyze this position carefully. 

Looking at the board, I notice:
- White has two rooks on b4 and e3, and a bishop on g7
- My king is on g8 with a rook on a8
- White's king is on d4, somewhat exposed
- I have a knight on f5 that has several good options
- I have a bishop on g7

The knight on f5 seems to be in a strong position with multiple good options. I could consider:
- f5d4 would capture White's king, but that's not legal in chess (must be a notation error)
- f5e3 would capture White's rook
- f5g3 could fork pieces depending on what's there

Let me make the strongest move by capturing the rook with my knight:

I'm playing as Black and I notice several key features:
- My king is on g8 with a rook on a8
- I have a knight on e3 that's quite active in White's territory
- I have a bishop on g7
- The pawn structure shows I have pawns on a7, b7, c7, e4, f7, and h5

Looking at my legal moves, I have several strong options:

1. My knight on e3 is very active and has multiple potential moves. The move e3g4 looks particularly strong as it attacks White's position.
2. I could develop my rook with a8d8, putting pressure on the d-file where White's king is.
3. I could also consider pawn advances like f7f5 to gain space.

After careful consideration, I'll move my rook to put pressure on White's king position:

2. I could advance my e4 pawn with e4d3 to create more threats
3. My rook on d8 could move along the d-file to increase pressure

After evaluating the position, I believe the strongest move is to attack with my knight.

- My rook on d8 has an open d-file

The knight on f5 is particularly well-placed and can make a strong move to d4, attacking White's pawn on c2 while maintaining a central position. This knight move increases my control of the center and creates tactical threats.

2. My e4 pawn is advanced and can push further
3. I have a bishop on g7 that could become more active

The knight on d4 is particularly strong, with potential to fork pieces or create threats. One of the most attractive moves is d4e2, which would fork the white king on d3 and potentially another piece.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

After analyzing the position, I can see I'm playing as Black with a fairly developed position. I have my king on g8, rooks on d8 and g8, a bishop on g7, and a knight on e2. 

The knight on e2 is particularly interesting as it's deep in White's territory and has several good options. I also notice my e4 pawn is advanced and could be pushed further.

Looking at the available moves, I think the knight on e2 is my most active piece and should be used effectively. The move e2c3 looks particularly strong as it:
1. Attacks White's b1 rook
2. Maintains the knight in a central, active position
3. Could potentially fork pieces in the future

- I can improve my rook position
- I have pawn advances available

The knight on f5 is particularly well-placed and could potentially fork pieces or create threats. Moving it to d4 looks especially strong as it would attack the c2 square (where White's rook is on b2) while also controlling central squares.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

I'll analyze the position as Black:

The position looks complex with both kings somewhat exposed. I have several tactical opportunities to consider:

1. My knight on e6 has good mobility and can attack White's pieces
2. I have a rook on d8 that controls the d-file
3. My bishop on g7 is active on the long diagonal

Looking at the legal moves, I see some promising options:
- The knight on e6 can move to various squares including f4 which could be aggressive
- The rook on d8 has multiple options along the d-file
- I could advance pawns to increase pressure

After evaluating the position, I believe moving my knight to f4 would be strong, putting pressure on White's position and potentially threatening tactical opportunities.

After analyzing the position, I see several promising options. I notice I have two rooks on the 8th rank, a bishop on g7, and a knight on f4 that could be developed.

The knight on f4 has several good options, including f4-d3 which would attack White's c-pawn. I also see that my e4 pawn is advanced and could potentially push forward.

Looking at the overall position, I think one of my strongest moves is to activate my rook on d8 by moving it to the open d-file where it can exert pressure.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

After analyzing the position, I see several strong options as Black. 

I notice I have a rook on d3 that's very active and can potentially create threats. I also have a knight on f4 that could be developed to a better square. My king on g8 is relatively safe, and I have a bishop on g7 that controls the long diagonal.

Looking at the position strategically, I think the most powerful move is to use my rook on d3 to attack along the third rank, particularly targeting White's bishop on g3. This creates an immediate threat and increases my piece activity.

- My king on g8 is safe for now
- My knight on g6 has several options
- I should be careful about the white rook on b4

I'll move my knight from g6 to f4, which puts pressure on the center and potentially threatens White's king position. This is a developing move that improves my piece's activity.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

After analyzing the position, I see several interesting options. I notice my knight on d5 is active with many potential moves, and I have a rook on g8 and bishop on g7.

Looking at the position strategically, I want to improve my piece coordination. The knight on d5 is well-placed and could potentially create threats by moving to e3, threatening White's king on d4. This would be a powerful fork between the king and rook on b4.

I'll make this strong tactical move:

I need to analyze this position carefully. I'm playing as Black and have several options.

Key observations:
- I have a knight on e3 that's quite active
- My king is on g8 with a rook on g7
- White has a rook on d4 that could be threatening
- I have a bishop on g7 that's currently on the same diagonal as White's king on d4

Looking at my legal moves, I see a strong tactical opportunity. My knight on e3 can attack White's king and rook simultaneously with a fork.

I notice my knight on d5 is well-positioned and can make several moves. My bishop on g7 is also active on the long diagonal. I should consider both defense and potential counterplay.

Looking at the legal moves, I think the knight on d5 offers good tactical possibilities. Moving it to f4 would attack White's rook on e5 while also putting pressure on the h3 square.

Among my legal moves, I should prioritize safety and development. The knight on g2 is actively placed and threatening White's position. My king on g8 could use some breathing room.

I'll move my king to h7, which gets it out of potential checks from the e-file and maintains a solid position.

Looking at the legal moves, I notice my rook on f8 is under attack by White's rook on f6. I should address this threat immediately. I could move the rook along the back rank, but I should consider which square is best.

I also notice my knight on g2 has several options and could potentially create threats.

After evaluating the position, I'll move my rook to safety while maintaining control of the back rank.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

After analyzing the position, I can see I'm playing as Black and have several options. The position looks complex with my king on g8, a rook on h8, and a bishop on g7. White has a queen on a7 which could be threatening.

I notice my knight on g2 has several good options. Moving it to e3 would create a fork, attacking both the white king on d1 and the rook on f2. This would be a very strong tactical move.

I notice my knight on e3 is well-positioned and can make several strong moves. One particularly good move is to fork White's king (on c3) and rook (on f2) with my knight.

I'm playing as Black and I see that:
- I have my king on g8 with a bishop on g7
- I have a rook on h8
- White has a queen on a7 and a rook on f6, both potentially threatening me
- I have a knight on d1 that could develop

Looking at the legal moves, I notice I can move my rook along the back rank, move my king, develop my knight, push pawns, or move my bishop.

The most pressing concern is my king's safety. White's rook on f6 and queen on a7 are threatening. Moving my rook to g8 would protect my king from potential checks along the g-file.

Looking at my legal moves, I need to prioritize safety and counterplay. The white queen on a8 is threatening my position, but it's not delivering an immediate check.

I notice I can move my bishop on g7, which is an important defensive piece. However, I should be careful not to weaken my king's position.

One strong move would be to advance my e-pawn with e5e4, creating counterplay and potentially opening lines for my pieces.

2. White has a king on d1, a queen on a8, a rook on f6, and pawns on a5, b7, and h2

This looks like a complex endgame position. Let me check what legal moves I have.

Now I understand my options. Let me evaluate the position and make the best move:

The position is quite complex. I notice:
- White's queen on a8 is threatening my c7 pawn
- White's rook on f6 is controlling key squares
- My king is on g8 with several possible moves
- I have a bishop on g7 and a rook on h7

Looking at my legal moves, I need to consider:
1. King safety
2. Protecting my material
3. Potential counterplay

The move c7c5 looks strong as it:
- Advances my pawn to a more active position
- Creates space for my pieces
- Potentially prepares for queenside counterplay
- Moves the pawn away from the immediate threat of White's queen

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

I need to carefully analyze this position as Black. Let me evaluate the key aspects:

1. Material: I have a rook, bishop, and king against White's queen, rook, and king, so I'm down material.
2. King safety: My king is on g8 with a bishop on g7 protecting it.
3. Threats: White's rook on g7 is threatening my position, and the queen on a8 is also dangerous.
4. Immediate concerns: I need to address the rook on g7 which is putting pressure on my position.

Looking at my legal moves, I see I can move my king, move my h-pawn, or advance my c5 or e4 pawns.

The most urgent issue is the white rook on g7 threatening my king's position. Moving my king to h8 would be a mistake as it could lead to a quick checkmate pattern. Instead, I should capture the rook with my bishop.

Wait - I don't see a capture move in my legal moves list, which means the bishop on g7 can't capture the rook on g7. This suggests the rook is protected or there's no bishop on g7 (the board representation might be unclear).

In this case, I need to move my king to safety. Moving to f8 gets me away from the rook's immediate threat.

- I'm facing potential threats from the white queen

The most critical aspects of this position:
1. My king's safety is paramount
2. The white queen on a8 is potentially dangerous
3. I need to consider both defensive and counterattacking options

Among my legal moves, I notice that moving my rook along the f-file could be powerful, especially since the white king is on the first rank. Moving my rook to f1 would create a direct threat.

As Black, I have a bishop on g7, my king on g8, and pawns on c5, e5, and h5. White has a queen on a8, a rook on f1, the king on d1, and pawns on a4, b7, and h2.

The position looks quite complex. My king appears to be somewhat exposed, and White's queen is on a8, potentially threatening something. Let me check my legal moves to understand my options.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Thank you for providing the legal moves. Let me analyze my options:

Available moves:
- Bishop moves: h7h8, h7g8, h7h6, h7g6 (Note: the bishop is actually on g7, not h7)
- Pawn moves: h5h4, c5c4, e4e3 (Note: there seems to be a pawn on e4 not e5 as I initially thought)

Looking at the position:
1. My bishop on g7 is protecting my king on g8. Moving it could be dangerous.
2. White's queen on a8 is not an immediate threat to my king.
3. Advancing pawns could be useful to gain space.

The most logical move appears to be advancing the e-pawn with e4e3, which puts pressure on White's position and gains space in the center. This pawn is not defending anything critical, and advancing it could create threats or prepare for future development.

Let me analyze my options:

1. My bishop on g7 can move to h8, g8, h6, or g6
2. My pawn on h5 can advance to h4
3. My pawn on c5 can advance to c4
4. My pawn on e3 can advance to e2

The most critical aspect of this position is that my e3 pawn is very advanced and can promote next move. Moving it to e2 creates an immediate threat to promote to a queen.

3. White has a queen on a8, rook on h1, king on c2, and pawns on a4, b7, and h7

The most powerful move available is to promote my e2 pawn to a queen, which would give me a significant material advantage.

Key observations:
- I have my king on g8 with a bishop on g7
- My queen is on e1, attacking along the e-file and diagonals
- White has a queen on a8 and a rook on h1
- Material is roughly even, but position is critical

Looking at my legal moves, I notice I have a powerful opportunity: my queen on e1 can capture White's rook on h1 with check.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

After analyzing the position and my legal moves, I see several key considerations:

1. White's queen on d7 is threatening my king on g8
2. I need to either move my king, block the check, or capture the queen
3. My queen on e4 is powerful and could potentially deliver a decisive blow

Looking at the legal moves, I notice I can move my bishop from g7 to either h6 or g6 to block the check. However, I should check if I have any stronger moves.

My queen on e4 has many options, and I should consider if there's a winning attack or a way to capture White's queen safely.

After careful consideration, I'll move my bishop to block the check while maintaining protection of key squares.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

I apologize for my mistake. Looking at the board and legal moves again, I see that the bishop is actually on g7 and the pawn is on h7 (not the other way around). 

Since White's queen on d7 is checking my king on g8, I need to address this immediately. From the legal moves, I can:
1. Move my king to h8
2. Block with my pawn by moving h7 to g6
3. Block with my queen by moving e4 to g6

The best move appears to be blocking with my pawn, which protects my king while maintaining my bishop on g7 and queen on e4 in their strong positions.

Now I can see the board position. I'm playing as Black and I notice I have my king on g6, a queen on d3, a bishop on g7, and pawns on c5 and h4. White has a king on c2, a queen on d7, and pawns on a4, b7, and h2.

Let me check what legal moves I have available.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

After analyzing the position and my legal moves, I see several strong options:

1. `d3d7` - Capturing White's queen would be a decisive material gain
2. `d3c2` - Capturing White's king would be checkmate
3. `g7b2` - My bishop could attack White's king, delivering check

The most decisive move is clearly capturing the king with my queen, which ends the game immediately.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Looking at the position, I'm playing as Black with my king on g7 and a bishop on g6. I also have pawns on c5 and h5. White has a queen on d7, king on c2, and pawns on a4, b7, and h2.

This is a critical position. My king is exposed, and White's queen on d7 is putting pressure on my position. I need to make a strong move to improve my situation.

The bishop on g6 is well-placed, controlling important diagonals. Moving my king to a safer square seems most urgent. I should avoid h6 as it could lead to checks from the queen.

I'll move my king to f8, which gets it away from the edge of the board and potential checks from White's queen.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Now I understand the position. Let me analyze the situation:

I'm playing as Black with my king on g6 and I have a bishop on f8, pawns on c5 and h5. White has a queen on c8, king on c2, and pawns on a4, b7, and h2.

My king is somewhat exposed, and I need to consider safety first. The white queen on c8 is currently not directly threatening my king, but I need to be careful about potential checks.

Looking at my options:
- Moving my bishop (f8 to g7/e7/h6/d6) could provide better protection for my king
- Moving my king (g6 to various squares) needs careful consideration to avoid walking into checks
- Moving my pawns (c5 or h5) could help create space or advancement

The best move appears to be moving my bishop to g7, which would protect my king and maintain control of the long diagonal:

Player_Black (to Proxy):

After analyzing the position and my legal moves, I need to make a critical decision. 

I notice that White has a queen on c8 which is a major threat. My king is on g6, and I need to ensure its safety while improving my position if possible.

Looking at my options:
- My bishop on g7 has several diagonal moves
- My king can move to several squares
- I can advance my c-pawn from c5 to c4
- I can advance my h-pawn from h5 to h4

The most pressing concern is my king's safety. Moving my bishop away could be dangerous as it might be defending my king. The safest move appears to be retreating my king to h7, which moves it away from potential threats.

I see my legal moves are quite limited. I have only three options:
1. h7h8 - Moving my pawn from h7 to h8 (promoting it)
2. h7g8 - Moving my pawn from h7 to g8 (promoting it with capture)
3. h7h6 - Moving my pawn from h7 to h6 (one square forward)

Looking at the position, I notice I have a pawn on h7 that can be promoted. This is clearly my best option as pawn promotion will give me a significant material advantage. Since there doesn't appear to be anything on g8 to capture, I'll promote straight ahead to a queen.

I need to analyze this position carefully. 

I'm playing as Black and I have:
- My king on h8
- A bishop on g7
- Pawns on c5 and h5
- White has a queen on f5 and king on d7

Looking at the legal moves, I notice my bishop on g7 has many diagonal options. The most critical aspect of this position is ensuring my king's safety while potentially creating threats.

The bishop on g7 is currently protecting my king from the white queen on f5. If I move the bishop, I need to ensure I'm not exposing my king to a check or worse.

The best move appears to be to activate my bishop with a move that creates a threat while maintaining safety. Moving the bishop to e5 would put pressure on White's position while staying on the same diagonal to protect against the queen.

After analyzing the legal moves and the board position, I can see that there's a critical situation. 

I notice that my bishop on e5 (which was shown as e4 in the board display but is actually e5 based on the legal moves) has several strong options. The most powerful move appears to be capturing White's pawn on h2 with my bishop, which would be a check to the White king.

This is a strong move because:
1. It captures a pawn
2. It delivers check
3. It creates a threat on the h-file where my pawn on h5 could potentially advance

I see the current position. I'm playing as Black and the situation looks quite interesting. I have my king on g8, a bishop on h2, and pawns on c5 and h5. White has a king on c2, a queen on d4, and pawns on a4 and b7.

Let me check what legal moves I have available.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Now I understand my options. Let me analyze the position:

1. I have my king on g8 with moves to h7 or g7
2. My bishop on h2 can move to several squares (b8, c7, d6, e5, f4, g3, g1)
3. I can advance my pawns with c5-c4 or h5-h4

The most critical aspect of this position is that White's queen on d4 is threatening my bishop on h2. I need to address this immediately. Moving the bishop is the priority.

Looking at the bishop moves, I should consider:
- Which move gives my bishop safety
- Which move creates counterplay or threats

The move Bh2-f4 looks strong as it attacks White's queen while moving to a safe square. This would force White's queen to move, giving me initiative.

I have my king on h8, a bishop on f4 (not f5 as I initially thought), and pawns on c5 and h5. White has a king on c2, a queen on a2, and pawns on a4 and b7.

Looking at my options:
- I have a powerful bishop on f4 with many diagonal moves
- The b7 pawn is about to promote, which is a serious threat
- White's queen on a2 is active but not immediately threatening me

The most critical move is to stop the b7 pawn from promoting. My bishop can reach c7 to control the b8 promotion square.

Now I understand the position. As Black, I have several options:

1. Move my king (h8h7 or h8g7)
2. Move my bishop on c7 in various directions
3. Advance my pawns on h5 or c5

Looking at the position critically:
- White has a queen on a1 and a king on c2
- White's knight on b8 is threatening my bishop
- My king on h8 is relatively safe
- My bishop on c7 is under attack

The most pressing issue is my bishop being attacked by the knight. I should either move it to safety or consider if there's a better tactical option.

The bishop has many diagonal options, and I notice it could potentially check White's king by moving to g3. This would be a strong move as it creates a threat while escaping the knight's attack.

- My bishop on g3 is currently attacking White's queen on a2 and king on c2
- If I capture the pawn on h4 with my bishop (g3h4), I'd lose the bishop to White's pawn recapture
- Moving my bishop to f2 would create a double attack on White's king and queen

The strongest move appears to be:

Looking at the position critically:
- White has a queen on a5 and a knight on c3
- My king is exposed on h8
- My bishop on f2 is active and potentially threatening White's king on c2

The best move appears to be to use my bishop to check the White king, which would force a response and potentially improve my position.

- Capturing the queen with e3c1
- Moving the bishop to a safer square while maintaining pressure

Since I can directly capture White's queen, which is the most valuable piece on the board, that's clearly the best move.

The move c1e3 would put my bishop on a strong diagonal and attack the white king, creating a check. This is a powerful move:

I see the position now. I'm playing as Black and I have a king on g8 and a bishop on e5, with pawns on c5 and h5. White has a king on d3, a knight on d8, and a pawn on a5.

Let me check what legal moves I have available.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Now I can see my legal moves. Let me analyze the position:

I'm playing as Black with my king on g8 and a bishop on e3. I notice there's a tactical opportunity here - my bishop on e3 is attacking the white king on d3, putting it in check.

Looking at my options, I should focus on maintaining or strengthening this advantage. Among my legal moves:

- The bishop moves (e3h6, e3g5, e3f4, e3d4, e3f2, e3d2, e3g1, e3c1) are critical to consider
- Moving the bishop to d4 would maintain the check while being protected from capture
- Moving to f2 would maintain the check from a different angle

I'll choose to move my bishop to d4, which maintains the check on the white king while placing my bishop in a protected square that controls important central squares.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Now I can see my legal moves. Let me analyze the position:

I have my king on h8 with three possible moves (h8g8, h8h7, h8g7), my bishop on d5 with multiple diagonal moves available, and I can advance my pawns on h5 and c5.

Looking at the position, I notice my bishop on d5 is very active and can potentially target White's king on c2. The move d5b3 would put White's king in check, but that move isn't listed in my legal moves, suggesting there must be something blocking that diagonal.

Since I can't directly check the king, I'll use my bishop to control important squares and maintain pressure. The move d5f3 would control important central squares, but again it's not in my legal moves list.

Based on the available moves, I'll move my bishop to c3, which puts pressure on White's position and controls important squares near White's king.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

I'll analyze this position carefully:

I'm playing as Black with a king on h8 and a bishop on c3. White has a king on d3 and a knight on d8. There are a few pawns on the board: Black has pawns on c5 and h5, while White has a pawn on a4.

This is a winning position for Black. I have a bishop versus a knight, and my bishop is very active, controlling important diagonals. The most decisive move here is to use my bishop to check the White king.

Looking at my legal moves, I can deliver check with:
- c3d4 (bishop checks the king)
- c3d2 (bishop checks the king)
- c3e1 (bishop checks the king)

Among these, Bd4+ (c3d4) seems strongest as it restricts the White king's movement while maintaining control of important diagonals.

Looking at my options, I notice my bishop on d4 has several strong moves. The most powerful appears to be attacking White's king with a check. This will force White to respond to the check and give me the initiative.

I have my bishop on e3 (not e5 as I initially thought), and I notice it's currently attacking White's knight on d4. I also see I have pawns on c5 and h5 (not h4).

Key considerations:
1. I can capture White's knight with my bishop (e3d4)
2. I can advance my pawns (c5c4 or h5h4)
3. I can move my king to safety
4. I can reposition my bishop to other diagonals

The most immediate opportunity is capturing the knight on d4, which would win material. This is clearly the strongest move in the position.

After analyzing the position and my available legal moves, I'll make a strategic decision.

The position shows I've already developed my knight to f6, and White has captured something on f4 (likely my other knight). I should continue development and secure my king's safety.

One of the strongest moves here would be to develop my dark-squared bishop to e7, which protects my king and prepares for castling.

2. White has developed their knight to f3 and has a pawn on h3
3. I have my knights on b8 and f6, and my dark-squared bishop on e7

Castling kingside would be a strong move here as it brings my king to safety and connects my rooks. This is a standard development move in many openings.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

After analyzing the position and my legal moves, I need to make a decision. 

I notice several key aspects of the position:
1. My king is on g8 without a pawn shield
2. I have knights on b8 and f6, with the f6 knight already developed
3. I have bishops on e7 and c8
4. White has developed their knight to f3

Looking at my options, I should prioritize king safety and piece development. Castling is no longer an option since my king has already moved to g8. Creating a pawn shield for my king would be prudent.

I'll play h7h6, which creates a small luft for my king and prevents any potential knight intrusions on g5. This is a solid, prophylactic move that improves my king's safety.

One strong move would be to develop my knight from b8 to c6, which would:
- Develop a piece
- Control the central d4 square
- Prepare to potentially challenge White's knight on e5

2. I have knights on c6 and f6, bishops on e7 and c8
3. My king is castled kingside

Looking at my options, I notice White's knight on e5 is a threat that I should consider addressing. I could attack it with my f6 knight by playing Nf6-d5, which would also develop my knight to a good central square.

Another good option is to continue development by moving my light-squared bishop or queenside rook.

After consideration, I'll play the knight to d5, attacking White's knight on e5 while developing to a strong central square.

1. White has a knight on f7, which is attacking my king on g8
2. I need to address this immediate threat
3. I have several options to deal with this, including capturing the knight or moving my king

The most direct response is to capture the knight with my king:

One of my strongest moves would be to develop my rook to e8, connecting my rooks and protecting the e-file. This is a natural developing move that improves my piece coordination.

After analyzing the position, I see that I'm playing as Black and have several interesting options. I notice I have castling available (e8g8), which is often a good move to improve king safety and connect the rooks.

Looking at the position, castling kingside would be a strong move as it gets my king to safety and connects my rooks. This is particularly important since White seems to have some pieces developed and I want to ensure my king's safety.

I notice I have a fairly active position with knights on c6 and d5, bishops on e7 and c8, and my king has castled kingside. Looking at the available moves, I should focus on improving my position and potentially increasing pressure on White's position.

One strong move would be to develop my knight on d5 to f4, which puts pressure on White's kingside and controls important central squares.

Looking at my options, I want to improve my position further. The knight on f4 is particularly strong and can make some threatening moves. I'll use it to increase pressure on White's position.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

After analyzing the position and available moves, I can see I'm playing as Black with a somewhat developed position. My king is castled on the kingside (g6), and I have knights on c6 and e4, with bishops on e7 and e5.

The knight on e4 is particularly strong, occupying a central outpost. I should consider whether to maintain this piece or use it for a tactical purpose.

Looking at potential moves, I notice my knight on e4 has several good options, including the fork possibility with e4f2, which would attack White's queen and rook simultaneously.

I'll make this tactical move:

2. g6f6 - Moving my king from g6 to f6
3. g6h5 - Moving my king from g6 to h5
4. f2e4 - Moving my knight from f2 to e4
5. f2d3 - Moving my knight from f2 to d3

Looking at the position, I notice my king is on g6 and I have a knight on f2. The knight on f2 is actively placed and can move to e4, which would attack White's queen on c3. This would create a tactical opportunity.

I'll move my knight to e4, attacking the queen:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

I see that I'm playing as Black, and my king is on g6. Let me analyze the position:

1. My king on g6 has 6 possible moves (g6h7, g6f7, g6f6, g6h5, g6g5, g6f5)
2. I notice my king is somewhat exposed, and I should consider its safety
3. I have bishops on c8 and e5, knights on c6 and e4, and my queen on d8
4. White has pieces including a queen on c2 that could be threatening

Looking at the king moves:
- Moving to h7 puts the king in the corner which can be restrictive
- Moving to f7 brings the king closer to my other pieces for protection
- Moving to f6 maintains a central position
- Moving to h5 or g5 moves toward the center but might be more exposed
- Moving to f5 approaches the center but could be risky near White's pieces

The safest and most flexible move appears to be f7, which brings my king closer to my other pieces while maintaining decent mobility.

I notice I have two knights - one on c6 and one on e4. The e4 knight is particularly well-positioned and can make several strong moves. I also see my king is on f7 with some potential vulnerability.

The knight on e4 has a particularly strong move to f2, which would fork White's king on e1 and rook on h1. This is a tactical opportunity I should capitalize on.

Looking at the board, I notice:
- I'm playing as Black and my king is on f7
- White has a bishop on c3 that's checking my king
- I need to address this check immediately

Among my legal moves, I have several options to deal with the check:
1. Block with e7-d6 (my bishop)
2. Block with c6-d4 (my knight)
3. Block with f2-d3 (my other knight)
4. Move my king to e6, e8, or f6

The best move appears to be blocking with my knight on f2 by playing f2d3. This not only blocks the check but also develops my knight to a more active central position where it controls important squares.

- I have a knight on e5 that's quite active

- The knight on e5 has multiple good squares (especially f3 which would fork White's king and rook)
- I could develop my rook on a8 with a8b8
- I could advance pawns to create counterplay

The knight move e5f3+ looks particularly strong as it gives check and forks the king and rook.

After analyzing the position, I see that I'm playing as Black and have several good options. 

I notice my knight on f3 is active and can make some interesting moves. I also have my bishops on e7 and e5, and my king on f7 is somewhat exposed.

One of the strongest moves here is to develop my rook to e8, which would connect my rooks and protect the e-file where my king is located.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

I can see that I have three legal moves as Black:
- f7f8: Promoting my pawn on f7 to the 8th rank
- f7f6: Moving my king from f7 to f6
- f7e6: Moving my king from f7 to e6

Looking at the position, I notice that:
1. I'm playing as Black and it's my turn
2. My king is on f7
3. White has a queen on c2 and a knight on a6
4. There's a white bishop on a7 and g7

The most important priority is king safety. Moving to f6 would put my king on the same diagonal as White's bishop on a1, which could be dangerous. Moving to e6 looks safer as it gets my king away from the g7 bishop and doesn't expose it to any immediate checks.

The move e7f6 (moving my bishop from e7 to f6) looks strong as it:
1. Develops my bishop to a more active diagonal
2. Protects my king
3. Controls important central squares

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

I need to analyze this position carefully. Here's what I observe:

1. Material is roughly even, but I'm playing as Black with my king on e5 in an unusual middle-game position
2. White has a queen on c3 and two bishops (a7 and e4)
3. I have a knight on e5 that's quite active but potentially under threat
4. My king on e5 is somewhat exposed

Looking at my options, I need to prioritize king safety while maintaining active piece coordination. The knight on e5 is a strong piece in the center, but I need to evaluate if it's safe there.

The move Ne5-c4 looks particularly strong as it:
1. Attacks White's queen on c3
2. Maintains my knight in a central, active position
3. Creates a tactical threat that White must respond to

I'll make this move:

4. I have a bishop on f6 with multiple potential moves

The knight on c4 looks particularly active and could create threats. Moving it to e3 would attack White's queen on c2 while also controlling important squares.

You are a professional chess player and you play as black. Now is your turn to make a move. Before making a move you can pick one of the following actions:
- 'get_current_board' to get the schema and current status of the board
- 'get_legal_moves' to get a UCI formatted list of available moves
- 'make_move <UCI formatted move>' when you are ready to complete your turn (e.g., 'make_move e2e4')

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Let me analyze the position and make a strong move as Black.

I notice several key aspects of the position:
- I have a knight on e3 that's actively placed and could potentially fork pieces
- My king is on e5 and seems relatively safe
- White has a bishop on a7 that's somewhat out of play
- I have two bishops (e6 and f6) that could be developed further

Looking at the legal moves, I see some interesting options:
- Knight moves from e3 could create threats
- I could develop my rooks on a8 or g8
- I could advance pawns to control more space

After careful consideration, I'll play the knight move e3g4, which attacks White's bishop on f6 and increases my control of the center and kingside.

e6e7,e6e5,e6d5

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

I can see that I'm playing as Black and have only three legal moves for my king on e6. Let me analyze the position:

The board shows my king on e6 with very limited mobility (only e7, e5, or d5 are legal). This suggests I'm in a difficult position, possibly in check or with many squares controlled by White's pieces.

Looking at the board:
- White has a queen on c2, which is controlling d3 and e4
- White has bishops on a7 and d4
- White has a knight on a6
- White has rooks on a1 and g1

My best move appears to be Ke5, moving away from the edge of the board and gaining more central control. This gives me more options for future moves and avoids getting trapped near the edge.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Thank you for providing the legal moves. Let me analyze the position:

I notice that:
1. I'm playing as Black and my king is on e5
2. White has a bishop on a7 that's attacking my king's diagonal
3. I have a knight on g4 that could make some interesting moves
4. My position seems somewhat exposed with the king in the center

After evaluating the options, I see that my knight on g4 can make a strong move to e3, which would be a fork attacking White's queen on c2 and potentially the rook on a1.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

I see the current position and my legal moves. As Black, I'm in check with my king on e5, and I have only three legal moves:
- e5e6: Moving my king up one square
- e5f4: Moving my king diagonally down-right
- e5d4: Moving my king diagonally down-left

Looking at the board:
- The white queen is on c2, which is putting my king in check
- Moving to e6 would still leave me in check from the queen
- Moving to f4 would put me in check from the white bishop on h2
- Moving to d4 seems safest as it gets me out of the queen's check and isn't immediately threatened

I'll make my move:
