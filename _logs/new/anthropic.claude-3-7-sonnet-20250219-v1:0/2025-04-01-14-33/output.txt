Now I have a clear picture of the position and my available moves. 

I see that White has played an early b4, capturing my pawn on c3. This is an unusual opening approach. As Black, I should focus on development and control of the center.

Among my options, developing a knight to f6 is a strong classical move that controls central squares and prepares for kingside castling. This is a standard developing move that follows good opening principles.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

After analyzing the position, I can see I'm playing as Black in what appears to be the early opening phase. White has played b4 and developed their pawn structure, but hasn't developed many pieces yet.

I have several good options:
1. Develop my knight with Nc6 (b8c6)
2. Play e5 (e7e5) to claim central space
3. Play d5 (d7d5) to claim central space

I think developing the knight to c6 is the most principled move here, as it controls important central squares and follows opening principles of developing pieces early.

1. Development is a priority in the opening, and I notice my bishops and rooks still need to be developed.
2. The center is contested, with White having played e4 and c4.
3. I could consider central pawn pushes like e5 or d5 to challenge White's center.
4. Knight moves to e5 or d4 could be strong, putting pressure on White's position.

After evaluating the options, I'll play e7-e5, challenging White's central control and opening lines for my bishop and queen. This is a standard response to White's e4 and helps me fight for the center.

Now I have a clear picture of my available moves. Looking at the position, I should focus on development and control of the center.

I notice that my knights are already developed, but my bishops and rooks are still on their starting squares. The e5 pawn gives me good central control, but I should continue developing my pieces.

One of the strongest moves here would be to develop my dark-squared bishop with Bf8-e7, which develops a piece, protects my e5 pawn, and prepares for castling.

This would bring my king to safety and connect my rooks. My king is currently in the center where it could become vulnerable, so castling is a priority.

After analyzing the position and my available moves, I see that I'm playing a Sicilian Defense type position where White has played c3 and d4. I notice my knight on f6 can capture the pawn on e4, which would win material.

Taking the e4 pawn looks like the best move as it captures a pawn without any immediate tactical refutation that I can see. This will also help me control the center.

Now I can see the board position. As Black, I need to assess the situation and consider my options. Let me check what legal moves I have available.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

After analyzing the position and available moves, I can see several key factors:

1. My king is on g8 with the rook on f8 - I could castle kingside with g8h8
2. I have knights on c6 and e4, with the e4 knight being particularly active
3. My bishop on e7 has several potential moves

The knight on e4 is well-positioned and putting pressure on White's position. I notice it can attack White's kingside with a fork opportunity by moving to f2, which would attack both White's king and rook.

After analyzing the position and my available legal moves, I'll make my decision.

I notice I have a knight on f2 that's quite active and threatening White's position. I also see my bishop on e7 is well-placed. Looking at the overall position, I should continue development and improve my pieces.

The knight on f2 is particularly strong, putting pressure on White's position. I'll move it to d3, which attacks White's c-pawn and maintains an active position in the center.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

I'll analyze the position and make a move.

The position appears to be in the middle game with some interesting tactical possibilities. I notice:

1. My knight on c6 has several options
2. My bishop on e7 can move to various squares
3. My knight on d3 is actively placed in White's territory and has multiple options
4. I have a pawn on e5 that could advance

Looking at the position more carefully, I see that my knight on d3 is particularly strong and is forking White's queen on a4 and potentially threatening other pieces. This is a tactical opportunity I should capitalize on.

I'll capture White's queen with my knight:

make_move d3a4

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

I apologize for the error. Let me check the legal moves again and make a valid move.

Looking at the legal moves list, I see that d3a4 isn't actually a legal move. Let me reconsider the position.

My knight on d3 is actually threatening White's king on e1, which is a powerful tactical opportunity. From the legal moves list, I can see that my knight on d3 can move to several squares including e1, which would be check.

I'll play:

After analyzing the position, I see several key features:
- I have a knight on e1 that's deep in White's territory
- My bishop on e7 is active
- White has a pawn on c5 that could be a target
- My king safety needs consideration

One of the strongest moves I have is to utilize my knight on e1, which is threatening White's position. I'll play:

make_move e1c2

This knight move attacks White's queen on c3, forcing it to move. If White captures my knight with the queen, I can recapture with my pawn, damaging White's pawn structure. This is a tactical opportunity that should give me an advantage.

- I have a knight on c6 and another on c2 (deep in White's territory)
- White has two pawns on c3 and c4
- I have a bishop on e7 that could develop further

The knight on c2 is a strong piece that's forked White's king on e1 and rook on a1. This is a very powerful tactical opportunity. I should capture the rook on a1 with this knight.

- My e5 pawn is under potential pressure
- I should continue development and improve my position

Among my options:
- Castling with g8h8 would improve king safety
- Developing the rook with f8e8 would connect my rooks
- Knight moves like c6d4 could attack White's pawn structure
- Bishop moves like e7f6 could improve piece positioning

I'll castle kingside to ensure my king's safety, which is a priority in the middlegame.

I'll develop my knight to d4, which puts pressure on White's central pawns and improves my piece activity. This is a strong square for my knight as it can't be easily dislodged.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

I'll analyze the position and make a strong move.

Looking at the board, I notice:
- I'm playing as Black
- White has a pawn on c3 attacking my knight on d4
- My knight on d4 is a strong piece in the center and has multiple good options
- I have a bishop on e7 that could be developed better

One of the strongest moves appears to be developing my knight on d4 to f5, which would:
1. Move to a safe square away from the attacking pawn
2. Control important central squares
3. Put pressure on White's position
4. Maintain my knight's active position

I can see all my legal moves now. Let me analyze the position:

I notice I'm playing Black and have a fairly developed position. My king is on g8, and I have a knight on f5 that appears to be well-placed. I also have a bishop on e7 that could be developed further.

Looking at the position strategically, I see that:
1. My knight on f5 is in a strong central position
2. I could castle kingside with either rook move (h8g8 or f8g8)
3. I have some good bishop moves available

One of the strongest moves appears to be completing my kingside castle with Rg8 (f8g8), which would connect my rooks and improve my king safety. This is a standard developing move that aligns with good chess principles.

Let me analyze the position and make a strong move as Black.

I notice several key aspects of the position:
- I have a knight on f5 that's quite active
- My king is on g8 with some exposure
- White has two bishops (c1 and f1) that could become dangerous
- I have a knight on a1 that's oddly placed and needs development

Looking at my options, I see a few strong candidates:
1. e7f6 - Developing the bishop to a good diagonal
2. f5d4 - Moving the knight to a central square
3. g8f8 - Improving king safety

After careful consideration, I'll develop my bishop to f6, which improves my piece coordination, helps control the center, and provides some king protection.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

I'll analyze the position to make the best move as Black.

Looking at the board:
- I'm playing as Black and have a knight on f6, a bishop on f5, and my king is on g8
- White has a knight on b2, bishops on c1 and f1, and the king on e2
- The pawn structure shows I have an advanced pawn on e5

Some key considerations:
- My king safety is important, and I notice I could castle by moving the king to f8 or e8
- I have development opportunities with my pieces
- The e5 pawn could be pushed to e4 to gain space

After evaluating the options, I'll make my move:

make_move e5e4

This advances my central pawn, gaining space and putting pressure on White's position. The e4 pawn will be difficult to challenge and gives me good control of the center.

One strong move would be to develop my knight on a1, which is currently in an unusual position. Moving it to c2 would attack White's knight on b2 and improve my piece activity.

I notice I have two knights (on f6 and e3) and two bishops (on f5 and f8). The position looks somewhat complex with potential tactical opportunities.

One of the strongest moves appears to be Nf6-e4, which attacks the pawn on f2 and improves my knight's position to a central square. This move increases my control of the center and creates threats.

After reviewing the position again, I see that one of my knights is on e3, which is well-positioned and putting pressure on the opponent's position. I can strengthen my attack with the move Ne3-g4, which increases pressure and creates new threats.

After analyzing the position and my available legal moves, I notice I have several tactical opportunities.

I see that my knight on g4 is attacking White's pawn on h2, and I also have a bishop on f5 that controls important diagonals. My king safety is important, and I should consider developing my pieces and improving my position.

One strong move I see is to develop my knight on f6 to e4, where it attacks White's pawn on f2 and is centralized. This knight move puts pressure on White's position.

After analyzing the position and legal moves, I'll make my decision.

I notice White's rook on g5 is threatening my f3 pawn. I also have a knight on h2 that's deep in White's territory. Looking at my options, I should prioritize either defending the f3 pawn or making a strong counterattack.

One of my best moves appears to be capturing the rook on g5 with my knight from f6, which would eliminate the immediate threat and win material.

One of the strongest moves I see is to develop my bishop and connect my rooks:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

I need to analyze this position carefully. 

I notice White has a rook on g4 that's attacking my g7 pawn. My knight on f5 is also under attack by White's pawn on h4. Additionally, there's a white rook on g4 that could be threatening my position.

Looking at my options, I see several strong possibilities:

1. I could move my knight from f5 to safety while delivering a check with Nf5-e3+
2. I could protect my g7 pawn with Qd8-f8
3. I could capture the rook on g4 with my knight on f5 (Nf5xg4)

However, I don't see Nf5xg4 in the legal moves list, which suggests the rook on g4 might be my own piece that was captured and is now displayed incorrectly.

Given the position and legal moves, I think the best move is to play Nf5-e3+, checking the white king and attacking a piece.

You are a professional chess player and you play as black. Now is your turn to make a move. Before making a move you can pick one of the following actions:
- 'get_current_board' to get the schema and current status of the board
- 'get_legal_moves' to get a UCI formatted list of available moves
- 'make_move <UCI formatted move>' when you are ready to complete your turn (e.g., 'make_move e2e4')

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

After analyzing the position, I can see I'm playing as Black and have several key decisions to make.

I notice my king is on e8, and I have a knight on f5 that's actively placed. There's also a white knight on a4 and a white rook on g4 that could be threats. My pawn on f3 is advanced and potentially strong.

Looking at the legal moves, I see several good options:
- I could castle kingside with e8f8 to improve king safety
- I could develop my knight on h2 with h2g4 or h2f1
- I could advance my f3 pawn with f3f2, creating a passed pawn

The most principled move here is to castle and improve my king's safety:

1. I have a knight on f5 that's actively placed
2. My bishop on d7 is developed
3. I have a pawn on f3 that appears to have advanced
4. White has a rook on g4 that could be threatening

Looking at my options, I think the most strategic move is to develop my knight on h2 to g4, which would put pressure on White's position and potentially threaten the rook.

After analyzing the position and available moves, I can see I'm playing as Black with a fairly developed position. I notice I have two knights (on f5 and e3), a bishop on d7, and my queen on e8. 

The knight on e3 is particularly strong, forking White's king on c3 and potentially threatening other pieces. This is a tactical opportunity I should capitalize on.

I'll play:

make_move e3c2

This knight move attacks White's king on c3, forcing it to move, while also potentially threatening White's bishop on c2 if there is one (though I can't fully see what piece might be there). This creates a strong tactical threat and should give me an advantage.

You are a professional chess player and you play as black. Now is your turn to make a move. Before making a move you can pick one of the following actions:
- 'get_current_board' to get the schema and current status of the board
- 'get_legal_moves' to get a UCI formatted list of available moves
- 'make_move <UCI formatted move>' when you are ready to complete your turn (e.g., 'make_move e2e4')

After analyzing the position, I see I have several options. I notice I have two knights - one on f5 and one on e1. My king is on e8, and I have a bishop on d7. 

The position looks somewhat complex with white having knights on c3 and f2, and a king on c2. I need to make a move that improves my position.

One of the strongest moves I see is to activate my knight on e1, which is currently not doing much. Moving it to c2 would create a fork attacking the white king and rook simultaneously.

I notice I have a knight on f5 that's well-positioned and can make several strong moves. I also have a knight on c2 that's deep in White's territory. My king is currently on e8 and could castle kingside by moving to f8.

Looking at the position, I see that my knight on f5 can move to d4, which would be a strong central square and would attack White's king on c3. This seems like a very strong tactical opportunity.

4. My king on g8 is relatively safe

One of my strongest moves appears to be developing my knight on d4 to f5, which would:
- Attack the pawn on g7
- Control important central squares
- Potentially prepare for future attacks against White's king position

You are a professional chess player and you play as black. Now is your turn to make a move. Before making a move you can pick one of the following actions:
- 'get_current_board' to get the schema and current status of the board
- 'get_legal_moves' to get a UCI formatted list of available moves
- 'make_move <UCI formatted move>' when you are ready to complete your turn (e.g., 'make_move e2e4')

Player_Black (to Proxy):

After analyzing the position and available moves, I notice several key factors:

1. I have a knight on c2 that can make several strong moves
2. My queen on e8 is active but could be better positioned
3. I have a bishop on d7 that could be developed

Looking at the knight on c2, it's deep in White's territory and has several good options. The move c2e3 looks particularly strong as it attacks White's king on c3 while also potentially threatening a fork.

I'll make this move:

make_move c2e3

Looking at the position more carefully, I see that my knight on e3 can make a strong move to d5, which would be centralized and potentially threatening. This knight move would increase my control of the center and put pressure on White's position.

- My king is on e8 with the option to castle kingside (g8f8)
- I have knights on d5 and f5 in active positions
- There's a pawn on f3 that has advanced deep into White's territory

Looking at the most promising moves:
- Castling kingside with g8f8 would improve my king's safety
- My knight on f5 has several good outposts including d4 and e3
- My knight on d5 also has strong options

I'll castle kingside to improve my king's safety, which is a priority in this middlegame position.

The knight on f5 has some good outposts, particularly e3 which would fork the white king on b2 and potentially another piece. This looks like a very strong tactical opportunity.

After analyzing the position, I see several good options. I notice I have two knights (on d5 and e3), a bishop on d7, and my queen on e8. The position looks somewhat complex with potential tactical opportunities.

I'll focus on improving my piece activity. The knight on e3 is well-placed and putting pressure on White's position. I see that my queen on e8 is currently somewhat passive, and developing it could be beneficial.

One strong move would be to centralize my queen with:

make_move e8e4

This move:
1. Places my queen on a more active central square
2. Puts pressure on White's pawn structure
3. Maintains flexibility for future plans
4. Increases my control of the center

The queen on e4 will be well-positioned to support potential attacks while not being immediately threatened.

After analyzing the position, I see several promising options. I notice I have a queen on f4 that's very active, and knights on d5 and c2. The white king is exposed on b2, which presents tactical opportunities.

Looking at the position, I see a powerful move: I can play my queen to e3, creating a double attack. This threatens both the white king and the knight on e5.

After analyzing the position and available moves, I see I have several options. 

I notice my knight on d5 is under attack by the white knight on e3, so I should consider moving it. I also have a knight on c2 that's in a strong position near the white king.

Looking at the position, I'll move my knight from d5 to f4, which attacks the white pawn on g2 and maintains pressure in the center.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

After analyzing the position and available moves, I'll make my decision.

The position appears to be in the middlegame with material roughly equal. I notice my king is on h8 with a rook on f8, and I have knights on f4 and c2, plus a bishop on d7.

I see a few strong options:
1. Knight f4 to d5 looks active, putting pressure in the center
2. Knight f4 to e6 controls central squares
3. Knight c2 to d4 would be a strong centralization
4. Bishop d7 to e6 develops the bishop to a good diagonal

I'll choose to play the knight to d5, which puts pressure on the center and potentially threatens the c3 pawn.

After analyzing the position and available moves, I'll make my decision.

The position appears to be in the middlegame with material roughly equal. I notice my knight on c2 has several good options, and my bishop on d7 can also be activated.

I think the most principled move is to develop my knight on c2 to a more active square. The knight on c2 can jump to e3, which would attack White's king on b3 and potentially create threats.

After analyzing the position and available moves, I see several interesting options. I notice I have two knights (on d5 and e3) that can make active moves, and my dark-squared bishop on d7 also has mobility.

Looking at the position, I see White's king is exposed on b3, which presents tactical opportunities. My knight on e3 is particularly well-placed, forking the white king and potentially other pieces.

I'll play the knight move e3c2+, which delivers check to the white king and threatens to win material.

Let me analyze the position:

I'm playing as Black, and I notice several key aspects:
- My king is on g8 with a rook on a8
- I have a bishop on d7 and a knight on c3
- White's king is exposed on a6
- There's a white knight on c6 that could be captured

Looking at my options, I see a strong tactical opportunity with my knight on c3. I can attack White's king and potentially create a decisive advantage.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

I need to analyze this position carefully. 

I see that I'm playing as Black and have several interesting options. My king is on g8, and I have rooks on a8 and h8, a bishop on d7, and a knight on e2. White has a knight on c3 that's attacking my bishop.

Key observations:
- My knight on e2 is attacking White's king on b4, which is a powerful position
- My bishop on d7 is under attack by White's knight on c5
- I should consider whether there are any tactical opportunities

Among my options:
1. I could move my bishop to safety (d7c6, d7e6, etc.)
2. I could develop my knight on e2 to a better square
3. I could consider king safety moves

The most striking feature is my knight on e2 giving check to White's king. This creates a tactical opportunity. Let me make the move:

- I have a bishop on d7 and a knight on c3
- White's king is on c4, somewhat exposed
- White has a knight on c6

Looking at my options, I see a few strong candidates:
1. Knight moves from c3 - particularly c3e4 which attacks the white king
2. Bishop moves from d7 - especially d7g4 which would pin the white king against the h-file
3. Rook moves along the back rank

The knight move c3e4+ would give check to the white king, forcing a response. This seems like the strongest immediate move as it puts pressure on the opponent.

2. White's king is on c3, quite exposed
3. I have a knight on e4 that could be developed aggressively
4. I have a bishop on d7 that could also be activated

One of my strongest moves appears to be moving my knight to f2, which would create a fork between White's king on c3 and the rook on h1. This is a classic tactical opportunity.

5. I have a bishop on d7

Looking at my options, the knight on f2 is in a powerful position and could potentially deliver a check or attack White's king. Let me make a move with this knight.

The move f2d3+ looks strong as it checks the White king and forces a response.

I notice my knight on d3 is attacking the white king, giving check. This is a critical moment where I need to make the most of this advantage. 

Looking at my options, I see that my knight on d3 can make several moves, but the most powerful one is:

make_move d3f2

This knight fork simultaneously attacks the white king (maintaining the check) and threatens White's f-pawn. This is a strong tactical move that forces the white king to move while I'll be able to capture material on the next move.

I see that I'm playing as Black and my king is on g8. White's king is on d4. I have a knight on f2, a bishop on d7, and rooks on a8 and h8. White has a knight on d8 which is currently checking my king.

Since I'm in check, I need to address that immediately. My options are:
1. Move my king (g8f8, g8e8)
2. Capture the checking piece (not possible here)
3. Block the check (not possible with a knight check)

Looking at the position, moving my king to f8 seems safest. This gets me out of check while maintaining protection of my h7 pawn.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

I need to analyze this position carefully. 

I see that I'm playing as Black and there's a complex middlegame position. White has a knight on d8 that's attacking my rook on f8. My king is on g8, and I have a bishop on d7, a knight on f2, and rooks on a8 and f8.

Looking at the legal moves, I notice several key options:
- I can move my king with f8g8 (castling kingside)
- I can move my attacked rook on f8
- I can capture with my bishop or knight
- I can develop my pieces further

The most pressing issue is my rook on f8 being attacked by White's knight on d8. I should either move the rook or capture the knight.

Looking at the position more deeply, I see that my knight on f2 is very active and threatening White's king on e5. This is actually a very strong position for me.

I'll play the knight move f2d3+, which gives check to White's king and also attacks the c5 pawn.

I need to analyze this position carefully. I'm playing as Black and I notice:

1. My king is on g8 with a rook on f8 - I could castle kingside with f8g8
2. I have a bishop on d7 and a knight on d3
3. White has a knight on d8 which is checking my king
4. White's king is on e5

Since I'm in check from the knight on d8, I must address this immediately. My options are:
- Capture the knight with my rook (a8d8)
- Block the check with my bishop (d7e8)
- Move my king out of check (f8g8 - castling would move my king away from the check)

The best move here is to capture the checking knight with my rook.

After analyzing the legal moves, I see that I can deliver checkmate with my bishop by moving it to g4, which would attack the king with no escape squares.

- I can also use my bishop to attack White's f-pawn with c4f7
- My rooks can be coordinated on the 8th rank

The most forcing move is to check the White king with my bishop:

Let me check what legal moves I have available.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Now I can see all my legal moves. Let me analyze the position:

I notice I have a bishop on d5 (not d4 as I initially thought) that's attacking White's king on e5. This is a check situation. I should consider whether I can deliver a decisive attack or gain material.

Looking at the bishop moves from d5, I can:
- Move to e6, c6, e4, c4, f3, b3, g2, a2, or h1
- The most aggressive option is d5e4, which maintains the check and attacks the king from a different angle

I also have rook moves from f8 and d8, and pawn moves.

Given that I have the king in check and can maintain pressure, I'll choose:

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Looking at the position, I see I'm playing as Black with a material advantage. I have two rooks on d8 and f8, and my king is on g8. White's king is on e4, and there are various pawns for both sides.

I notice several strong options:
1. I could play d8d4+ to check the White king
2. I could play d8d1 to control the first rank
3. I could castle with f8g8 (O-O)

Since my king is already on g8, the move f8g8 would actually be moving my rook to g8, not castling. This would strengthen my king's protection and connect my rooks.

The most forcing move is the check with d8d4+, which would immediately put pressure on White's king.

I'll make this move:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

I can see the current position and my legal moves. Let me analyze the position:

1. I'm playing as Black with my king on g8 and a rook on f8
2. White's king is on d4
3. The pawn structure shows I have pawns on a7, g7, h7, and White has pawns on b4, c3, f6, h6

Looking at my options, I notice my rook on f8 is currently undefended. Since I have the option to move my king to g8, this suggests my king is currently on h8 and I can castle kingside (O-O). However, the board shows my king is already on g8, so this must be a different move.

Given the position, I should prioritize activating my rook to control more of the board. Moving the rook to the e-file or d-file would give me more control of the center.

I'll choose to move my rook to the e-file:

I'm playing as Black and have a king on g8, a rook on g7, and pawns on a7, g7, and h7. White has a king on d3, a bishop on f6, and pawns on b4, c3, and h6.

My legal moves are:
- g8f8 (King move from g8 to f8)
- g7h6 (Rook capture of White's pawn)
- g7g6 (Rook move down)
- a7a6 (Pawn advance)
- g7g5 (Rook move down two squares)
- a7a5 (Pawn advance two squares)

The best move here appears to be capturing White's pawn with my rook, which eliminates a potential threat and gains material.

I'm playing as Black with my king on g8 and a rook on f7. White has a bishop on f6 and the white king is on e4. 

Key observations:
- My king is in check from the bishop on f6
- I need to address this check immediately
- My options are to move the king or block with the rook

Looking at the legal moves, I can:
1. Move my king to f8 or g7
2. Move my rook to block (but this isn't in the legal moves, so not possible)

Moving to g7 would put me in check from the bishop again, so that's not good. The safest move is to go to f8, which gets me out of check and keeps my king protected.

Looking at the position strategically:
1. My rook is already active on the c-file, putting pressure on White's pawn
2. I should consider advancing my a-pawn which has a clear path
3. I need to keep my rook active while supporting my pawns

The strongest move appears to be advancing my a-pawn with a7a5, creating a passed pawn that will require White's attention and potentially create a decisive advantage.

I'll move my rook to c1, which puts pressure on White's position and restricts the White king's movement.

I can see the current position. This appears to be an endgame with:
- Black king on g8
- Black pawns on g7, h7, and a4
- Black rook on c6
- White king on b4
- White pawn on b6

Let me check what legal moves I have as Black.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

I see my legal moves now. Let me analyze the position:

This is an endgame position where I (Black) have a rook and three pawns against White's lone king and pawn. I have a significant material advantage and should be able to win this game.

Looking at the position:
1. My rook on c6 can capture White's pawn on b6, which would eliminate White's only pawn
2. My a4 pawn is being attacked by the White king
3. I need to be careful about promoting my pawns safely

The strongest move here is to capture White's pawn with my rook:

I have my king on h8 (not g8 as I initially thought) and can move to g8 or g7. I also have pawns on h6 and a5 that can advance.

This is a critical endgame position. My strategy should be to advance my pawns toward promotion while keeping my king active. The white king is on b6, which is far from my h-pawn but close to my a-pawn.

I'll advance my h-pawn since it's further along and the white king is far away from it:

Thank you for providing the legal moves. Let me analyze the position:

I have the following legal moves:
- h8g8 (King move)
- h8g7 (King move)
- h7h6 (Pawn move)
- h5h4 (Pawn move)
- a5a4 (Pawn move)

Looking at the board again, there seems to be a discrepancy between the board display and the legal moves. The board shows my pawns on a4 and h4, but the legal moves suggest I have pawns on h7, h5, and a5.

Based on the legal moves provided, I should focus on my king position and pawn advancement. The most critical aspect is dealing with White's h7 pawn which is close to promotion.

I'll move my king to g7 to approach White's pawn and prevent its promotion.

Now I understand my options. This is a king and pawn endgame where I need to make a careful decision.

Looking at the position:
1. The white king is far away on a8
2. I have pawns on a5, h5, and h7
3. My king is on g7

The most promising plan is to advance one of my pawns toward promotion. Since the white king is on a8, my h-pawn is the farthest from the white king and has the best chance of promoting.

I'll advance my h-pawn:

I see my legal moves now. Let's analyze this position:

I have three pawns (a5, h5, and h7) and my king is on g7. The white king is on b8, far away from my pawns. This gives me a clear advantage.

My best strategy is to advance one of my pawns to promote it to a queen. The h-pawn is closest to promotion, so I'll focus on that.

I notice I can move h7-h5, which would advance my pawn two squares. However, I already have a pawn on h5 according to the board, so there must be an error in either the board representation or the legal moves list.

Looking at the board again, I see pawns on a5, h5, and h7. The move h7-h5 would be illegal since h5 is already occupied.

I'll choose to advance my a-pawn, which is a safe and strong move:

I see the current board position. We have a king vs king endgame with a few pawns remaining. I'm playing as Black (lowercase symbols), with my king on g7. I have pawns on a5, h4, and h2. White's king is on d7.

Let me check what legal moves I have available.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

I see my legal moves now. This is a critical position where I have a pawn on h2 that can promote immediately. This is clearly the strongest move available.

When promoting a pawn, I should generally choose a queen as it's the most powerful piece. The h2 pawn can promote to a queen, rook, bishop, or knight, but the queen is almost always the best choice as it combines the powers of a rook and bishop.

I'll promote my h2 pawn to a queen:

The most direct approach is to use my queen to restrict White's king and deliver checkmate. One strong move is to place my queen on c8, which controls important squares and puts pressure on the white king.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

I see my legal moves now. Let me analyze this endgame position:

I have two pawns (on a5 and h4) that can potentially promote, while White has only a king. My king is currently on g7.

Looking at the pawn moves:
- h5h4 is listed, but there's already a pawn on h4 according to the board display, so this seems to be an error
- a4a3 is listed, but the board shows a pawn on a5, not a4

Let me focus on what I can see on the board. The most important goal in this endgame is to safely advance my pawns to promotion. My king should support this while preventing the white king from capturing my pawns.

Since the white king is far away on c8, I should advance my a-pawn while keeping my king close enough to support it. Moving my king to f6 would be a good move as it heads toward the queenside while still controlling the center.

Now I understand the position and my available moves. I need to make a strategic decision as Black.

Looking at the position:
- My king is on f6 with several possible moves
- I have pawns on a5 and h4 that can advance to a4 and h3 respectively
- White's king is far away on b8

The best strategy here is to advance one of my pawns toward promotion while keeping my king in a good position to support the pawn's advance. Since the h-pawn is already more advanced than the a-pawn, I'll push that one.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Thank you for the clarification. Now I see that my pawns are on a5 and h5, and the legal moves include advancing either pawn (h5h4 or a5a4).

Looking at the position strategically:
1. The h-pawn is closer to promotion
2. White's king is on b8, far from my h-pawn
3. I should advance the h-pawn while using my king effectively

I'll push the h-pawn forward:

Let's check what legal moves I have as Black.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Now I understand the available moves. This is a critical endgame position where both sides have a pawn that could potentially promote.

Let's analyze the position:
- My king is on f6 and White's king is on a7
- I have a pawn on h4 and White has a pawn on a4
- Both pawns are ready to advance toward promotion

The key strategic decision is whether to advance my h-pawn or use my king to stop White's a-pawn. Since the white king is far away from my h-pawn (on a7), while my king is also far from White's a-pawn, this is essentially a pawn race.

In such a race, I need to calculate which pawn will queen first. My h-pawn needs 4 moves to promote (h4-h3-h2-h1), while White's a-pawn also needs 4 moves (a4-a3-a2-a1). However, I'm to move now, which gives me a tempo advantage in the race.

The best move is to advance my pawn immediately to start the race:

I see all my available moves. As Black responding to e4, I have several strong options. The most principled responses include:

1. e7e5 - directly contesting the center (leading to open games)
2. c7c5 - the Sicilian Defense, an aggressive counter-attacking option
3. e7e6 - the French Defense, solid but slightly passive
4. c7c6 - the Caro-Kann Defense, solid and reliable
5. d7d5 - the Scandinavian Defense, immediately challenging White's pawn

As a professional player, I'll choose the Sicilian Defense with c7c5, which is one of the most popular responses at the highest level. It creates immediate imbalance and gives Black good counterplay.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Looking at the position, I need to respond to White's unusual opening with e4 and g4. 

As Black, I'll play a principled move developing a knight to f6, which challenges White's e4 pawn, develops a piece, and follows good opening principles. This is a standard developing move in the Sicilian Defense.

1. I'm playing as Black and it appears to be in the opening phase
2. White has played b4 and has developed some pawns in the center and kingside
3. I've already played c5 and developed my knight to f6

Looking at my options, I should focus on development and controlling the center. The most principled moves would be:
- e7e5: Stake a claim in the center
- d7d5: Control the center squares
- b8c6: Develop the knight to a natural square

I'll go with developing my knight to c6, which is a natural developing move that supports my c5 pawn and controls important central squares.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Thank you for providing the legal moves. Let me analyze the position and make a strategic decision.

Looking at the position, I should continue with my development while maintaining a solid position. I notice several good candidate moves:

1. e7e6 - Developing the bishop and controlling the center
2. d7d5 - Challenging White's e4 pawn and fighting for the center
3. e7e5 - Taking more central space
4. c6e5 - Developing the knight to an active square

Among these options, I think developing with e7e6 is most principled. It opens lines for my bishop, prepares for d5, and continues with a solid development plan.

After analyzing the position, I see I'm playing as Black in a relatively early stage of the game. White has developed some pieces and has a rook on h6, which is unusual. I need to continue my development while ensuring my king's safety.

Looking at the legal moves, I notice I can develop my bishop with f8e7 or continue knight development. Since my king is still in the center, I should prioritize castling or king safety.

The move g8 with my rook (h8g8) would prepare for kingside castling, which is a good strategic choice in this position to secure my king.

This knight move to e5 places my piece on a strong central square where it controls important central squares and puts pressure on White's position. From e5, the knight attacks White's pawn on c4 and d3, creating immediate tactical threats while improving my overall development.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

After analyzing the position, I see several good options as Black. I notice my knights are well-positioned, and I have good development overall.

One strong move is to develop my rook to the open c-file with a8b8, which would connect my rooks and prepare to use the c-file for counterplay.

Another good option is to play e5c4, attacking White's pawn on b2 while developing my knight to a more active square.

After careful consideration, I'll choose to play the knight to c4, which puts pressure on White's position and attacks the b2 pawn.

Let me analyze the position and make a strategic move as Black.

I notice I'm in a middle game position with knights developed and some pawn structure established. Looking at the legal moves, I have several good options:

1. I could develop my bishop with e7d6
2. I could advance my central pawn with e6e5
3. I could move my knight to a better square like f6d5 or f6e4

The knight move to e4 (f6e4) looks particularly strong as it attacks the center and puts pressure on White's position. This knight will be well-placed on e4, controlling important central squares and potentially threatening White's pieces.

You are a professional chess player and you play as black. Now is your turn to make a move. Before making a move you can pick one of the following actions:
- 'get_current_board' to get the schema and current status of the board
- 'get_legal_moves' to get a UCI formatted list of available moves
- 'make_move <UCI formatted move>' when you are ready to complete your turn (e.g., 'make_move e2e4')

Player_Black (to Proxy):

I need to analyze this position carefully. Here's what I see:

1. I'm Black and have a knight on e3 that's very active in White's position
2. My king is on g8 with the rook on h8, so castling has already occurred
3. I have a bishop on e7 that could be developed
4. White has some pawns advanced on the kingside (g4, h4)

The knight on e3 is very strong and threatens several pieces. I could consider:
- e3xg2 attacking the white bishop on g2
- e3xc2 which would win a pawn
- e3f1+ which would fork the king and rook

After evaluation, I think the best move is to capture the bishop on g2, which will disrupt White's kingside structure and win material.

1. I'm playing as Black and have a knight on g2 that's attacking White's position
2. My king is on g8 with the rook missing from f8
3. I have a bishop on e7 that could be developed further
4. My pawn structure is mostly intact

Looking at my options, the knight on g2 is very active and threatening White's position. I should consider either capturing something valuable with it or moving it to another strong square.

The move g2e3 looks particularly strong as it forks White's king on e1 and another piece (likely a rook). This would be a powerful tactic.

One strong move would be to develop my knight on f5 to d4, where it puts pressure on White's position and can't be easily challenged. This knight move would attack White's c2 pawn and potentially create tactical threats.

I'll play the knight fork:

make_move e2c3

This move checks the white king and simultaneously attacks the white queen on d1. This is a powerful fork that will either force the king to move (losing the queen) or require the queen to block/capture the knight (losing material). It's a strong tactical shot that takes advantage of White's exposed king position.

You are a professional chess player and you play as black. Now is your turn to make a move. Before making a move you can pick one of the following actions:
- 'get_current_board' to get the schema and current status of the board
- 'get_legal_moves' to get a UCI formatted list of available moves
- 'make_move <UCI formatted move>' when you are ready to complete your turn (e.g., 'make_move e2e4')

I can see the current board position. This is quite an unusual position with White's king already on b5 in the middle of the board. Let me check what legal moves I have as Black.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

After analyzing the position and my available moves, I notice several important factors:

1. White's king is dangerously exposed on b5
2. I have an opportunity to attack it with my queen
3. My bishop on e7 can also join the attack

The most powerful move appears to be:

make_move d8a5

This queen move directly attacks White's king, putting it in check. Since the king is already so exposed in the middle of the board, this check could lead to a very strong position or even a quick checkmate sequence depending on how White responds. The queen on a5 will control important squares around White's king and potentially set up tactical threats.

2. I have a bishop on e7 that could be developed better
3. My king is on f8 with potential to castle kingside

Given these observations, I'll make a move that improves my position by castling kingside, which will connect my rooks and improve my king's safety.

The position is quite complex with my queen on a5 and bishops on e7 and f8. I notice my king is on g8 and there's a potential threat from White's knight on h6.

Looking at my strongest moves, I think I should develop my queen to create pressure. The move Qa5-c7 looks particularly strong as it:
1. Develops the queen to a more active position
2. Controls important central squares
3. Prepares for potential attacks

I'll analyze the position and make a strategic move as Black.

Looking at the board:
- White's king is on c3, somewhat exposed
- My king is on g8 with a rook on h8 and a8
- I have a queen on c7 and bishops on e7 and e5
- There appears to be potential for development and attacking chances

Among my options:
- I could develop with moves like f7-f5
- I could improve my queen's position
- I could consider kingside castling (which would be g8-f8 in this position)

The move g8f8 looks good as it improves my king's safety by moving toward the castled position. This helps connect my rooks and improves my king's position.

Looking at the position more carefully, I see that White's king is on c3, which is quite exposed. My queen on b6 is already putting pressure in that area. I can increase this pressure by moving my queen to c6, which maintains control of important squares and threatens the white king's position.

After analyzing the position, I see several promising options. I notice my king is on f8, and I have the opportunity to castle kingside with either "f8g8" or "h8g8". Castling would improve my king's safety.

I also see my queen on c6 has many potential moves, including some attacking options.

Given the position, I think castling kingside is a strong move that will improve my king's safety while connecting my rooks.

One of the strongest moves appears to be moving my queen to attack White's king while also threatening other pieces. The move Qc6-f3 looks particularly strong as it:
- Puts the king in check
- Threatens the rook on a3
- Creates a powerful attacking position

3. My king is on g8 with a rook on a8 and h8
4. There's a pawn structure to consider

Looking at my options, I notice that my dark-squared bishop on d6 has several good moves. I can also advance some pawns to improve my position.

After evaluation, I think the best move is to develop my bishop with d6c5, putting pressure on White's position and controlling more of the center.

- The bishop on c5 has many good squares, particularly the diagonal toward White's king

4. White has material advantage with a queen

The bishop on f2 is very active and potentially threatening. I should consider either using it for a strong attack or protecting it if it's under threat.

Looking at the moves, I can see several options with my bishop on f2. Moving it to e3 would put White's king in check, which seems like a strong move.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

I need to analyze this position carefully. 

I'm playing as Black and I notice several important features:
- I have a bishop on e3 that's very active and threatening White's position
- White's king is exposed on c3
- I have material equality (both sides have similar pieces)

Looking at my legal moves, the bishop on e3 has many options. Since it's attacking the white king's position, I should consider how to maximize this advantage.

The move e3g1 looks particularly strong as it attacks White's rook on c1 while maintaining pressure on the king's area. This creates a tactical threat that White must respond to.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

After analyzing the position, I see several important factors:
1. I'm playing as Black and my king is on g8
2. White has a queen on d4 threatening my position
3. I have a bishop on g1 that can make several moves
4. My e5 pawn is under attack by White's f4 pawn

The most critical issue is that my bishop on g1 is very active and can potentially create threats. Looking at the legal moves, I have some interesting options with this bishop.

I'll play the bishop to c5, which puts pressure on White's king on c3 and creates a powerful diagonal control.

Looking at the current position, I notice several important factors:

2. White's queen is on d4, threatening my bishop on c5
3. My king is on g8 and appears safe for now
4. Material seems roughly equal

The most pressing issue is my bishop on c5 being under attack by White's queen. I need to either move it to safety or defend it.

Among my options:
- Moving the bishop (c5d6, c5b6, c5d4, etc.)
- Advancing pawns for development or creating space

The best move appears to be to retreat the bishop to a safer square while maintaining its activity. The diagonal b6-f2 looks particularly strong.

1. White's queen is on d6, attacking my bishop on c7
2. My king is on g8 and appears to be relatively safe
3. I have a bishop on c7 under attack and another on e6
4. White's king is on c3

Let me check what legal moves I have available.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Thank you for the list of legal moves. Let me analyze the position and make the best move.

I notice that my bishop on b6 is under attack by White's queen on d6. I need to address this threat immediately.

Looking at my options:
- I could move the bishop to safety with moves like b6c5, b6a5, etc.
- I could capture White's queen with b6d8, but this doesn't seem right as there's no queen on d8
- I could develop other pieces or make pawn moves

The move b6c7 seems unusual since there's already a bishop on c7 according to the board. Let me double-check the position...

There might be some confusion in the board representation. Based on the legal moves, it seems my bishop is on b6, not c7 as I initially thought.

Given the available moves and the position, I'll move my bishop to c5, which gets it out of the queen's attack while maintaining good diagonal control.

3. My king is on g8 and seems relatively safe for now
4. Material appears roughly equal

Looking at my legal moves, the bishop on f2 has many strong options. This bishop is a powerful piece right now, positioned deep in White's territory. I should consider how to best use it.

The move f2b6 looks particularly strong as it attacks White's a-pawn while maintaining pressure. Alternatively, f2c5 creates threats against White's position.

After careful consideration, I'll move my bishop to b6, which maintains an active position while attacking White's a-pawn.

I see the current board position. I notice that White's queen is on h6, which could be threatening my king. I also see that I have a bishop on f2 that appears to be attacking White's position. Let me check what legal moves I have available.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

I see that I have only three legal moves available:
1. g8f8 - Moving my king from g8 to f8
2. g8h7 - Moving my king from g8 to h7
3. h8h7 - Moving my rook from h8 to h7

Looking at the position, I notice that White's queen on h6 is putting my king in check. I need to respond to this threat immediately. My options are:
- Move the king (to f8 or h7)
- Block the check with my rook (h8h7)

Moving to h7 with either piece would place me next to the queen, which is dangerous. Moving my king to f8 gets me away from the queen's attack while maintaining better king safety.

After analyzing the position and my legal moves, I notice I have a bishop on f2 that's deep in White's territory, which is a strong piece. I also see that my king on f8 is somewhat exposed.

One of the strongest moves available is to develop my bishop on f2 to a more active diagonal while maintaining pressure. The move f2-c5 looks particularly strong as it maintains the bishop's influence while targeting White's position.

Among my options, I notice the bishop on c5 has several strong moves. In particular, the move c5f2+ looks very promising as it gives check to the white king on c3 and also threatens to win material.

I notice that:
1. I have a bishop on f2 that's very active and threatening White's position
2. White's king is on c3, somewhat exposed
3. White has a queen on h6, which could be threatening my kingside
4. I have several pawn moves available

After evaluating the options, the bishop on f2 seems to be my most active piece. Moving it to e3 would put pressure on White's king while maintaining control of important diagonals.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

I need to address the immediate threat to my king. Looking at the legal moves, I notice White's queen is on h6 threatening my king on f8. 

My best options appear to be:
1. Move my king to e8 or e7
2. Block with g7-g6
3. Capture the queen (but I don't see a legal move for that)

Since the queen is directly threatening my king, I should prioritize safety. Moving to e8 keeps my king on the back rank where it's generally safer.

- White's queen is on h6, threatening my kingside
- I have a bishop on f2 that appears to be a strong piece with many available moves
- My king is on e8 and seems to be under some pressure

Looking at my options, the bishop on f2 seems to be my most active piece with many good moves. I should consider either improving its position or using it to create threats.

One strong move appears to be:

make_move f2e3

This move maintains control of the important diagonal, puts pressure on White's position, and maintains flexibility for my bishop. It also indirectly defends against some potential threats to my king.

After analyzing the position and my legal moves, I notice several important factors:

1. White's queen is on h5, creating pressure on my kingside
2. I have two bishops - one on e3 threatening White's position
3. My king is in the center on e8

One of my strongest moves is to use my bishop on e3, which is actively placed and threatening several squares. The move e3f2 looks particularly strong as it attacks White's pawn structure.

After analyzing the position, I see I'm playing as Black and have several options. I notice my king is on e8, and I have a bishop on f2 that's actively placed deep in White's position. White's queen is on h5, which could be threatening.

Looking at my options, the bishop on f2 has many strong moves. I can also see that my e5 pawn is advanced and could be pushed further.

Given the position, I'll move my bishop from f2 to capture the white knight on h4, which appears to be a free piece.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

I need to carefully analyze this position. I'm playing as Black and there appears to be significant pressure on my position.

Looking at the board:
- White's queen is on h5, threatening my kingside
- My king is on e8 with limited mobility
- I have a bishop on h4 with several possible moves
- White's king is on c3, quite exposed

Among my legal moves, I notice that my bishop on h4 has several strong options. In particular, I can check White's king with h4g3. This would put immediate pressure on White and force a response.

Another strong option is h4f2, which would attack White's rook on a1 while maintaining pressure on the kingside.

After careful consideration, I'll check the White king:

Among my options, I should prioritize safety and development. The move g3h4 looks strong as it develops my bishop to an active square while putting pressure on White's position.

1. My king on e8 is in check from White's queen on h5
2. I need to address this check immediately
3. I have several options to deal with the check:
   - Move the king (e8d8)
   - Block with the bishop (h4d8)
   - Capture the queen (not possible)

Looking at my options, moving the king to d8 seems safest as it gets out of check while maintaining good king safety. The alternative of blocking with the bishop on d8 would sacrifice my bishop to the queen.

Now I can see my legal moves. Let me analyze the position:

1. White's queen on h6 is threatening my kingside, so I need to address this threat.
2. My bishop on h4 has several good diagonal moves available.
3. I have both rooks on the back rank.
4. My king is on d8 and appears somewhat exposed.

After evaluating the position, I see that my bishop on h4 has some strong moves. Moving it to f6 would protect my g7 pawn and help defend against White's queen threat. This would strengthen my kingside defense.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

I see that White has made the first move with 1.g3, moving their g-pawn forward one square. This is a hypermodern opening approach, likely aiming to fianchetto the bishop on g2 later.

Let me check my legal moves to respond.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Now I can see all my legal moves. As Black responding to 1.g3, I have several good options:

1. e7e5 - Taking central space with the e-pawn
2. d7d5 - Taking central space with the d-pawn
3. g8f6 - Developing the knight to a good square
4. c7c5 - Playing a Sicilian-type structure

Since White has played a flexible move that doesn't immediately contest the center, I'll play 1...e5, taking central space and keeping my options open for development. This is a classical response that gives me good control of the center.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

I'll analyze the position as Black:

White has played an early d4 and has developed with f3 and h3, somewhat unusual. As Black, I should focus on controlling the center and developing my pieces.

Looking at the legal moves, I have several good developing options:
- b8c6 (Knight to c6) - develops a knight and controls central squares
- f8e7 (Bishop to e7) - develops the bishop to a safe square
- d7d5 (Pawn to d5) - stakes a claim in the center

Among these, I think developing the knight to c6 is most principled, as it controls important central squares and prepares for further development.

I'll focus on developing my pieces while putting pressure on White's position. One of the strongest moves here is to capture White's d-pawn with my knight, which would gain material and increase my control of the center.

The position appears to be in the early opening phase. White has played e3 and f4, developing their king to f2. I have a knight on d4 which is centralized and another knight on f6. My e-pawn has advanced to e5.

Looking at my options:
- My knight on d4 is well-placed and can make several moves
- I can continue development with moves like Bd6, Be7, or Bb4
- I could castle kingside with h8g8 (O-O)

Since development is important in the opening, and my king safety is a priority, I'll castle kingside which also connects my rooks.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

I need to analyze the position carefully before making my move.

I notice I'm playing as Black and the position appears to be in the early middlegame. White has advanced some kingside pawns and has castled kingside. I have knights on f6 and d4, with the d4 knight being particularly active.

Looking at my options, the knight on d4 is well-placed and has many potential moves. It's currently attacking White's e2 square and applying pressure. I could consider moving it to f5, which would attack White's pawn structure.

Another strong option is to develop my dark-squared bishop from f8, possibly to e7 which would protect my king and prepare for castling.

After evaluating my options, I'll develop my bishop to e7, which is a solid developing move that protects my king and prepares for castling.

- White has advanced pawns on e5, f6, g7, and h6
- My knight on d4 is well-placed and has many options
- My bishop on e7 is developed but somewhat restricted
- I haven't castled yet

Among my options, I see several strong candidate moves:

1. Knight d4-f3 would fork White's queen and king, winning material
2. Knight d4-e2 would also fork White's queen and king
3. Knight d4-c2 would fork White's queen and rook

The knight fork on f3 is clearly the strongest move as it attacks both White's queen on e5 and king on f2 simultaneously, forcing White to move the king and allowing me to capture the queen next move.

I can see the current board position. I'm playing as Black, and it appears White has just moved their queen to c4, creating some pressure. Let me check what legal moves I have available.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

After analyzing the position, I notice several important factors:
- White's queen on c4 is creating pressure
- My knight on f3 is attacking White's king on f2
- I need to consider both defensive and attacking options

The most critical move appears to be checking the White king with my knight on f3. This forces White to respond to the check and gives me the initiative.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

After analyzing the position, I can see I'm playing as Black and need to make a move. 

I notice White's queen is on c4, creating some pressure. My king is on e8, and I have knights on f6 and e1 (the latter is an unusual position, likely captured from White). I also see my bishops on e7 and c8.

Looking at the legal moves, I should prioritize development and king safety. The knight on e1 is oddly placed and could be developed with a move like Ne1-f3 or Ne1-g2.

Since White's queen is active, I should also consider improving my position and potentially creating threats of my own.

I'll develop my knight from e1 to f3, which puts pressure on White's g-pawn and improves my piece coordination.

I notice I have a knight on f3 that's very active and threatening White's position. This knight is attacking White's king on f1 and could deliver a check. I also have another knight on f6 that could potentially join the attack.

One of my strongest moves appears to be:

I need to analyze this position carefully. White's queen is on e4, directly attacking my e-pawn on e5. I also notice my knight on f6 can capture the queen with Nf6xe4.

Looking at the legal moves, I see that Nf6xe4 is indeed available. This would win White's queen for my knight, which is an excellent trade (queen for knight).

3. I have good bishop development

One strong move I see is to attack White's exposed king with my knight:

This knight move directly attacks White's king, creating an immediate threat. It also attacks White's rook on a1 simultaneously, creating a fork between the king and rook. This should force White to address the check, giving me a tactical advantage.

After analyzing the position and my available moves, I see several interesting options. My knight on e4 is well-placed, and I have another knight deep in White's position on d2, which is quite strong.

I'll play a move that develops my bishop on e7 while also putting pressure on White's position. This bishop can control the important a3-f8 diagonal.

After analyzing the position and my available moves, I need to make a decision.

I notice I have a knight on e4 that's quite active, and I should consider my development and king safety. One strong move would be to develop my bishop on c5, which is already out and can be repositioned effectively.

I'll play the bishop to e7, which helps protect my king and prepares for castling:

Given that my knight on f2 is directly attacking White's king on e4, I should capitalize on this tactical opportunity. This is a check that will force White to respond.

I'll analyze the position as Black:

The position appears to be in the middle game with some pieces developed. I notice:
- White has a bishop on a4 that's attacking my queenside
- My knight on e4 is active in the center
- I have another bishop on e7 that could be developed
- White's king is on e2, somewhat exposed

Looking at my options, I see several strong moves:

1. I could develop my knight on e4 to threaten White's king with e4f2+
2. I could develop my bishop on e7
3. I could castle kingside with g8h8

The knight move e4f2+ looks particularly strong as it's a check that would fork White's king and rook. This would win material.

3. My bishop on e7 has several diagonal options
4. I have a pawn on d4 that could be vulnerable

The knight on f2 is particularly interesting as it's an active piece that could threaten White's king on e2. I should consider whether to retreat it or use it tactically.

Given the position, I'll castle kingside to improve my king's safety and connect my rooks.

2. White has developed their kingside with the king on e2 and bishops on f2 and f1
3. White has advanced pawns on g4, h4, and e5
4. My king is on e8 with pieces still in their starting positions, though my dark-squared bishop has moved to e7

I should focus on developing my pieces and ensuring king safety. The bishop on e7 is already developed, but I need to get my other pieces into the game.

One of the best moves here would be to castle kingside, which would immediately improve my king safety and connect my rooks.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

After analyzing the position, I see that I'm playing as Black and White has developed their bishops and moved some kingside pawns. I notice my bishop on e7 has several good options, and I should consider developing my pieces and potentially castling.

Looking at the legal moves, I think castling kingside would be a good choice to secure my king's safety. This would be the move "g8f8" in UCI format.

Looking at the position, I need to make a strategic decision as Black.

I notice that:
- White has developed pieces on the kingside with a rook on f3 and bishop on h3
- White's king is on e2, somewhat exposed
- My king is still on e8 with pieces undeveloped
- White has pawns on g4 and h4, creating some space on the kingside

One of my best options is to castle kingside to improve my king's safety. This will also connect my rooks.

I notice my king is in the center (e8), and I should consider castling for safety. I also see that my dark-squared bishop on e7 has several good diagonal moves available, and my pawn on d4 could potentially capture something.

Looking at the board more carefully, I see White has a rook on f3 and a knight on c3 that could be threats. My pawn on d4 appears to be able to capture something on e3, which would likely be a white pawn.

The move d4e3 looks particularly strong as it would capture a pawn and increase my control of the center. This would also open up my queen's diagonal.

I'll make this capture:

I see that White has a rook on f6 that's attacking my e-pawn on e5. I should address this threat. I also notice White has developed pieces actively with a knight on c3 and bishops on g3 and f2.

Looking at my options:
- I could capture the rook with e5xf6, but that would walk into a discovered attack from the bishop on g3
- I could move my bishop on e7 to protect the e5 pawn
- I could advance pawns to develop my position

The most pressing issue is protecting the e5 pawn. Moving my bishop to f6 would both protect the pawn and develop my piece.

I see that White has a rook on f4 attacking my f-pawn, and I have a bishop on f6 that's undefended. White also has a bishop on h3 that's controlling the long diagonal. My king is on e8 and appears to be in the center.

Looking at my options:
- I could develop my knight with Bf6-e7, which would protect my d-pawn
- I could move my king to safety with Ke8-f8
- I could castle queenside with O-O-O (but that doesn't appear in the legal moves, so my rook must have moved)
- I could defend against immediate threats

Given the exposed position of my king and White's active pieces, I should prioritize king safety. Moving my king to f8 seems prudent as it gets out of the center and away from the diagonal controlled by White's bishop on h3.

Looking at the position, I notice several important factors:
- White has a rook on f4 attacking my e-pawn
- My king is on f8 with potential safety concerns
- I have a bishop on f6 that could be developed better

One of the most pressing issues is the e3 pawn under attack. I should either defend it or make a counter-threat. I also need to improve my king's safety.

After analyzing the position, I'll castle kingside to improve my king's safety and connect my rooks.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

I need to analyze the position carefully before making my move.

Looking at the board, I notice:
- White has a rook on f6 that's attacking my position
- My king is on g8 with limited mobility
- I have a bishop on f6 that could be developed
- White has a knight on c3 and bishops on g3 and h5

One of the most pressing issues is the white rook on f6, which is putting pressure on my kingside. I should consider either defending against potential threats or creating counterplay.

Among my options:
- Moving the king to f8 (g8f8) would get out of potential discovered checks
- Developing my queen to e7 (d8e7) could provide defense and flexibility
- The bishop on f6 has several good options including e5 (f6e5) or g5 (f6g5)

I think the most principled move is to develop my queen to e7, which defends the f6 bishop and improves my piece coordination.

Looking at my options, I should move my queen to safety while potentially maintaining some counterplay. Among the queen moves, e7e5 looks strong as it:
1. Moves the queen to safety
2. Controls the center
3. Puts pressure on White's position

Let me analyze the position and find the best move for Black.

I notice several key aspects of the position:
- White has two bishops on g3 and h3 pointing at my kingside
- My queen on e5 is active and has many possible moves
- White's rook on f4 is attacking my pawn on f7
- I have a pawn on e3 that's advanced and threatening

Looking at the legal moves, I see several promising options:

1. The e3 pawn is very advanced and could promote soon - e3e2 looks strong
2. My queen could attack White's rook with e5f5
3. I could defend my f7 pawn with my king by playing g8f8

After evaluation, I believe the most pressing move is to advance my passed pawn, which creates immediate threats and forces White to respond.

After analyzing the position and my available moves, I notice I have my queen on f5 and bishops on c8 and f6. The position looks somewhat open, and I should consider improving my pieces or addressing any immediate threats.

Looking at the board, I see White has bishops on g5 and h5, and a knight on c3. My king is on g8, and I should consider its safety.

One strong move would be to develop my queen to a more active position while maintaining control of key squares. The move `f5e4` stands out as it:
1. Places my queen on a more central square
2. Controls important central squares
3. Increases pressure on White's position

2. White has two bishops on g3 and h3, a knight on e4, and rooks on e1 and f1
3. My bishops are on c8 and f6
4. I need to consider development, king safety, and potential threats

Looking at the position, I notice my bishop on f6 is well-placed and has several possible moves. However, I should prioritize development and king safety. My queenside is undeveloped, and developing the queenside rook would be beneficial.

I'll develop my queenside rook:

- My king is on g8 with a rook on h8 and f8
- I have a bishop on f6 that has several possible moves
- My pawn structure is mostly intact

The bishop on f6 is quite active with many possible moves. I should consider if there are any tactical opportunities or if I need to improve my position.

Since White has a knight on e5 and a rook on f5, I should be careful about potential threats. Moving the bishop to g5 would develop it to a good diagonal while maintaining control of important central squares.

1. My king is on g8 with a rook on h8, so castling isn't an option anymore.
2. White has a rook on e5 that's quite active in the center.
3. I have two bishops (on b8 and d8) that need development.

Looking at my legal moves, I notice I can develop my dark-squared bishop with d8e7 or d8c7, which would be good development while connecting my rooks.

The move d8e7 seems particularly strong as it:
- Develops my bishop
- Connects my rooks
- Controls important central squares
- Prepares for potential kingside defense

After analyzing the position, I can see that:

1. White has two rooks on the e-file (e4 and e6), creating pressure
2. My king is on g8 with a rook on h8 and f8 is empty
3. I have a bishop on e7 that has several possible moves
4. White's king is on d3, relatively exposed

One of my most pressing concerns is the White rook on e4 which is attacking my e-pawn on e6. I should address this threat.

Looking at my options, I have a few good candidates:
- Moving my bishop to f6 would defend the e-pawn
- Moving my king to f8 would be a safe developing move
- Capturing the rook with d6xe5 would eliminate the threat but might lead to complications

I think the most principled move is to defend my e-pawn with the bishop while maintaining flexibility.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

I need to analyze the position carefully before making my move.

Looking at the board, I notice:
- White has two rooks on the e-file (e4 and e6)
- My king is on g8 with a rook on h8
- White's king is on e3
- I have bishops on b8 and f6

The most pressing issue is the white rook on e4, which is attacking my e-pawn. I also need to be careful about potential threats along the e-file.

Among my options:
- Moving my king to f8 (g8f8) would be a natural move to improve king safety
- The bishop on f6 has several options, including e5 which would defend the e-pawn
- I could also consider advancing pawns to create counterplay

After evaluation, I believe the best move is to defend the e-pawn with my bishop.

I'm playing as Black and I notice:
- I have a bishop on e5 that's actively placed and attacking White's position
- My king is on g8 with a rook on h8
- White has a rook on f6 that could be threatening

Looking at my options, I see several strong possibilities:
1. Moving my bishop on e5 to various squares
2. Castling-like king move g8f8
3. Various pawn moves

The bishop on e5 is well-positioned and attacking White's position. Moving it to f4 would maintain its activity while potentially threatening White's king on e3.

I need to analyze the position carefully before making my move.

Looking at the board, I notice:
- I'm playing as Black with my king on g8
- White's king is on d3
- Material is roughly even, but piece activity matters
- My dark-squared bishop on f4 is very active and has multiple good options

The bishop on f4 is particularly strong, controlling important diagonals. Among the possible moves for this bishop, I see tactical opportunities:

1. f4h2 would attack White's h-pawn
2. f4g3 could create threats against White's king
3. f4e5 would control more central squares

After consideration, I believe the most active and threatening move is to place my bishop on g3, where it puts pressure on White's position and restricts the White king's mobility.

- White has a bishop on b4 attacking my queenside
- I have a bishop on g3 that's actively placed
- Material seems roughly equal

Among my options:
- Moving my king (g8f8) could be good for safety
- Moving my bishop on g3 to a better diagonal
- Advancing pawns to improve my position

The bishop on g3 is very active and controls important squares. Moving it to e5 would place it on a strong central square where it controls more of the board and puts pressure on White's position.

- My king is on g8 with a rook on h8 and b8
- White's king is on e3
- The pawn structure is somewhat broken on both sides

I notice that White's bishops are quite active, especially the one on e4 which is controlling the c6-h1 diagonal. I should be careful about potential threats.

Among my legal moves, I see several options:
- King moves (g8f8)
- Rook moves (b8a8)
- Pawn advances

Since there's no immediate threat, I should focus on improving my position. Moving my king to f8 would be a good prophylactic move, improving king safety and freeing the g8 square for potential future use.

- I have a bishop on c8
- The pawn structure is somewhat intact but there are some open files

Looking at my options, I should consider:
- King safety (possibly castling if available)
- Developing my pieces
- Controlling the center

Among my legal moves, I see I can castle kingside with "f8g8". This would improve my king's safety and connect my rooks. Castling is generally a priority in the middlegame when it's available.

I'll make this move:

3. I have a rook on b8 that can move to a8.
4. I have several pawn moves available.

Looking at the position, I should prioritize king safety and piece coordination. Moving my king to g7 seems reasonable as it gets out of the back rank and maintains protection of the f7 pawn.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

After analyzing the position, I can see I'm playing as Black with my king on g7. White has a bishop on b4 and the white king is on f3. I need to consider my best options.

Looking at the legal moves, I notice I can improve my rook position or make some pawn moves. Since my king on g7 seems relatively safe at the moment, I'll focus on activating my rooks.

The rook on h8 can be centralized, which is generally a good principle in chess. Moving it to e8 would place it on a more active square, controlling the e-file and potentially supporting future operations in the center or queenside.

1. I'm playing as Black with my king on g7
2. White has a bishop on b4 and king on f3
3. I have rooks on b8 and e8
4. I notice my e8 rook has many available moves

Looking at the position, I should consider improving my piece activity. The e8 rook is currently on an open file and has potential to become more active.

I'll move my rook to e3+, which puts White's king in check and applies pressure. This is a strong active move that forces White to respond.

I'm playing as Black and I see I have a rook on b8, a bishop on c8, and my king on g7. White has a bishop on b4 and the white king is on e3. Material is roughly equal, but I need to consider my best move.

Looking at the legal moves, I should consider:
1. King safety - my king is relatively exposed
2. Piece activity - improving my rook or bishop position
3. Pawn structure - potential advances

Among my options, moving the rook to a8 (b8a8) seems like a solid move. This centralizes the rook on the open a-file, which could be useful for future operations.

I'll make this move:

I can see all my legal moves now. Let me analyze the position:

I'm playing as Black and the position is quite simplified. Material is roughly equal with both sides having a rook, bishop, and several pawns. My king is on g7 while White's king is on e5.

Looking at my options:
- I should consider king safety first
- I need to be mindful of potential threats
- I should look for opportunities to improve my position

The move a8b8 (moving my rook from a8 to b8) seems reasonable as it centralizes my rook slightly and maintains flexibility. This is a solid developing move that doesn't create any weaknesses.

I can see the current position and my available legal moves. Let me analyze the position:

1. I'm playing as Black and have a rook on b8, bishop on c8, and king on g7
2. Material seems roughly equal with limited pieces on the board
3. White has a bishop on c3 and king on e3
4. There's a white pawn on g5 that could be a concern

Looking at my options, I should consider:
- Improving my king's position
- Activating my rook
- Advancing pawns to create threats or prepare for promotion

The rook on b8 is currently not very active. Moving it to a8 doesn't improve its position significantly. My king could potentially move to f8 to centralize it and get away from the g5 pawn.

I think the best move is to centralize my king:

I'm playing as Black with my king on f8. I have a rook on b8 and a bishop on c8. The position appears to be in the endgame phase with relatively few pieces left.

Looking at my options:
- I can move my king to e8, g8, e7, or g7
- I can move my rook to a8
- I have several pawn moves available

Since this is an endgame position, king activity is important. Moving my king toward the center would be beneficial. The move Ke7 (f8e7) looks strong as it activates my king and moves it toward the center of the board.

I need to analyze this position carefully as Black.

Looking at the board:
- I'm playing as Black with my king on e7
- White has a bishop on f6 which is checking my king
- I need to address this check immediately

My options to deal with the check are:
1. Move my king (e7f8, e7d8, or e7f7)
2. Capture the bishop (not possible)
3. Block the check (not possible)

Among the king moves:
- e7f8 moves to the back rank but could be vulnerable to checks
- e7d8 also moves to the back rank
- e7f7 stays in the middle of the board

I'll choose to move my king to f7, which seems to provide the best position while getting out of check.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

I can now see the current board position and my legal moves as Black. Let me analyze the position:

I'm playing as Black with my king on f7. I have a rook on b8, a bishop on c8, and pawns on a7, b7, d7, d6, h7. White has a king on f5, pawns on a4, b4, c3, g6, h4.

Looking at my options, I need to consider king safety and piece activity. My king is somewhat exposed, and I should be careful about potential checks.

Among my legal moves:
- Moving my king to e7, e8, f8, g7, or g8 seems reasonable
- Moving my king to f6 would be dangerous as it approaches the white king
- Moving my king to e6 could be risky due to potential checks
- Moving my h7 pawn to g6 would lose a pawn for no compensation

The most natural move appears to be to improve my king position by moving it to the back rank, which provides better safety. Between e8, f8, and g8, I'll choose g8 as it keeps my king protected while maintaining flexibility.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

I see the position now. I'm playing as Black and my king is on g8. I have a rook on b8, a bishop on c8, and pawns on a7, b7, d7, d6, and h7. White has the king on f4 with pawns on a4, b4, c3, h7, and h4.

Looking at my legal moves, I can move my king to:
- h8 (right)
- f8 (left)
- h7 (diagonal down-right)
- g7 (down)
- f7 (diagonal down-left)

Since I want to keep my king safe while maintaining flexibility, I'll move my king to g7. This keeps the king protected while giving it more squares to move to in the future.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

I need to analyze the position carefully before making my move.

Looking at the board, I see I'm playing as Black with a king on g7, a rook on b8, a bishop on c8, and pawns on a7, b7, d6, and d7. White has a king on e5 and pawns on a4, b4, c3, h4, and h7.

Key observations:
- My king is relatively safe but should avoid moving to f7 or h7 due to potential checks
- The h7 pawn is a passed pawn that could be dangerous
- My rook on b8 is currently undefended
- I have a bishop on c8 that could be developed

Given the material equality and position, I should focus on activating my pieces and creating counterplay.

I'll move my rook to a8, which keeps it safe and maintains control of the a-file:

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Let me analyze the position:

I'm playing as Black in what appears to be an endgame. I have:
- A rook on a8
- Pawns on a7, b7, and d6
- My king on g7
- A bishop on c8

White has:
- A rook on h8
- Pawns on a4, b4, c3, and h4
- The king on e4

Looking at my legal moves, I need to consider my priorities:
1. King safety
2. Piece activity
3. Pawn advancement

The white rook on h8 is a concern. Moving my king to f7 would be a good move to get away from the back rank and maintain control of the position. This also keeps my king centralized and protects my d-pawn indirectly.

1. I'm playing as Black and material is roughly equal
2. The position is quite simplified with few pieces left
3. My king is on f7 and White's king is on e4
4. I have a rook on a8 and a bishop on c8
5. The white rook on h8 is a potential threat

Looking at my options, I should consider:
- Activating my rook by playing a8b8
- Advancing my king toward the center with f7e6
- Pushing pawns to create passed pawns

The most principled move is to activate my rook, which is currently not doing much on a8. Moving it to b8 will put it on a more active file and potentially support pawn advances later.

Looking at my options:
- I could move my king, but need to be careful about checks
- I could advance my pawns to create counterplay
- I could reposition my rook or bishop

The most pressing concern is my king's safety. With White's king on e5 and rook on h8, I need to be careful.

I think the best move is to advance my d-pawn to create counterplay and potentially open lines for my bishop:

Player_Black (to Proxy):

I need to analyze this position carefully as Black.

Current assessment:
- Material is roughly equal (I have a rook, bishop, and 3 pawns vs White's rook and 4 pawns)
- My king is on f7, somewhat exposed
- White's king is on e4, centralized
- I have a rook on b8 and bishop on c8

Looking at my options:
1. Moving my king (f7g7, f7e7, f7g6, f7f6) - improving king safety is important
2. Advancing pawns (d7d6, b7b6, a7a6, b7b5) - could create space or prepare pawn advances
3. Moving my rook (b8a8) - doesn't seem to accomplish much

The most pressing concern is my king safety. Moving to g7 would be good as it gets my king away from the e-file where White's king is. This also maintains protection of my bishop on c8.

I'm playing as Black and I see that:
- I have a rook on b8 and a bishop on c8
- My king is on g7
- White has a rook on h6 which is threatening my king
- Material is roughly equal with both sides having some pawns and a rook

The most urgent issue is that White's rook on h6 is threatening my king. I need to address this immediately. Looking at my legal moves:

1. Moving my king to g8, f8, f7, or h6 are options
2. I could move my rook to a8
3. I could advance my pawns

The safest move appears to be moving my king away from the threat. Among the king moves, g7-f7 seems best as it moves away from the rook while maintaining king activity.

1. My king is relatively safe at the moment
2. I have a material advantage with a rook and bishop vs White's single rook
3. White's rook on h6 is active but not immediately threatening

The best move appears to be to activate my rook by moving it to the open a-file:

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Looking at the position, I see that I'm playing as Black and my king is on f7. White has a rook on h6 that's currently threatening my position. I need to make a good move to ensure my king's safety.

From the legal moves available, I notice:
- I can move my king to several squares (g8, f8, e8, g7, e7)
- I can move my rooks or pawns

The most pressing concern is my king's safety. The white rook on h6 is threatening the h-file, and I should be careful about potential checks. Moving my king to g8 would be a good defensive move, keeping it away from the white rook's influence.

I see the current position and my legal moves. Let me analyze the situation:

1. I'm playing as Black and have a king on g8, a rook on a8, a bishop on c8, and pawns on a7, b7, and d7.
2. White has a king on e5, a rook on h6, and pawns on a4, b4, d4, and h4.
3. White's rook on h6 is threatening my position on the third rank.

Looking at my options:
- Moving my king (g8f8, g8g7, g8f7) seems reasonable to improve king safety
- Moving my rook (a8b8) doesn't accomplish much
- Advancing pawns (d7d6, b7b6, a7a6, b7b5) could develop my position

The most pressing concern is my king's safety with White's rook on h6. Moving my king to f8 keeps it protected by the bishop on c8 and moves it away from the h-file where White's rook is positioned.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

I need to analyze the position carefully before making my move.

Looking at the board:
- I'm playing as Black with my king on g8
- White has a rook on h3 that's controlling the third rank
- White's king is on f4
- I have a rook on a8 and a bishop on c8
- The pawn structure is somewhat reduced

The most critical aspect is my king's safety. The white rook on h3 could potentially deliver a check if I move carelessly. I should prioritize king safety while trying to activate my pieces.

Among my options:
- King moves (g8f8, g8g7, g8f7): Moving to f8 seems safest as it gets away from potential checks from the h-file
- Rook moves (a8b8): This doesn't accomplish much
- Pawn moves: b7b5 could gain space on the queenside and potentially activate my bishop later

I'll choose to move my king to f8, which improves my king's position and avoids potential threats from the h-file.

Looking at my options, I need to consider safety and activity. My king is currently on f8, and I notice I can move it to g8, which would be a reasonable defensive move. However, I should also consider improving my position.

Since White's rook is on h6, moving my king to g8 would put it on the same file as White's rook, which isn't ideal. Moving to e8 would be safer and maintain flexibility.

I'll move my king to e8:

Player_Black (to Proxy):

I can see the current position now. As Black, I'm in a simplified endgame position with my king on e8, a rook on a8, a bishop on c8, and pawns on a7, b7, and d7. White has a rook on h6, king on e5, and pawns on a4, b4, d4, and h4.

Looking at my legal moves, I need to make a strategic decision. The most pressing issue is that White's rook on h6 is active and potentially threatening. I should consider either defending against potential threats or improving my piece positions.

Since my king is safe for now and not in check, I'll focus on activating my pieces. The bishop on c8 is currently blocked by my own pawns, and my rook on a8 could be more active.

I'll move my rook to b8, which develops it to a more central file and keeps it protected.

After analyzing the position, I can see I'm playing as Black with my king on e8, a rook on b8, a bishop on c8, and pawns on a7, b7, and d7. White has a rook on h6 that's attacking my third rank, and the white king is on f2.

I need to make a decision based on the legal moves available. My priorities are:
1. King safety
2. Piece activity
3. Pawn structure

Looking at my options, I should improve my king's position since it's currently in the center. Moving to the kingside with Kf8 seems logical as it gets my king away from the center and starts moving toward the corner for safety.

2. I have a rook on b8 and a bishop on c8
3. White has a rook on h6 that's currently attacking my 6th rank
4. The pawn structure is somewhat scattered

Looking at my options, I should prioritize king safety and piece coordination. The white rook on h6 is potentially threatening, but not directly attacking any of my pieces at the moment.

One of the best moves here would be to castle kingside, which would improve my king's safety and connect my rooks. This is represented by the move f8g8.

3. White has a king on e1, rooks on h3 and h8, and pawns on a3, b4, d4, and h4

Looking at the position, I notice:
- White's rook on h8 is threatening my king
- I need to address this immediate check

From my legal moves, I have three king moves (g8f8, g8g7, g8f7) and other pawn/rook moves.

The most natural response to the check is to move my king to f8, which gets out of check and maintains control of important squares.

I'm playing as Black and have a rook on b8, a bishop on c8, and my king on f8. The material on the board appears roughly equal, with White having a rook on h6 and king on e1.

Looking at my options:
- I can move my king (f8g8, f8e8, f8g7, f8f7, f8e7)
- I can move my rook (b8a8)
- I can advance my pawns (b7a6, d7d6, b7b6)

Since my king appears to be relatively safe at the moment, I'll prioritize development and activity. Moving my king to g8 seems reasonable as it maintains king safety while potentially freeing up the f-file for my rook.

The d7 pawn appears to be under attack by the white rook on d6. My king is relatively safe for now, but I should consider improving my position.

I'll move my king to h8, which is a safe square and gives me more flexibility for future moves.

- White has a rook on e5 that's attacking my d-pawn

Looking at my options:
1. King moves (h8g8, h8h7, h8g7) - generally I want to keep my king safe
2. Rook moves (b8a8) - doesn't seem very active
3. Pawn moves (d7e6, b7a6, d7d6, b7b6) - need to consider which advances my position

The most pressing issue is that my d7 pawn is under attack by White's rook on e5. I should either defend it or move it. Moving d7-d6 would develop the pawn while maintaining control of e5, preventing White's rook from advancing further.

- Moving the king (h8g8, h8h7, h8g7) doesn't seem urgent as I'm not in check
- Moving the bishop (c8d7, c8e6) could develop it, but doesn't address immediate threats
- Moving the rook (b8a8) doesn't accomplish much
- Advancing the b-pawn (b7b6 or b7a6) doesn't address immediate threats

The most pressing issue is my d4 pawn being attacked by the white rook on e5. Since I don't have a direct way to defend it with my legal moves, I should focus on counterplay.

I'll develop my bishop to improve my position:

I need to analyze this position carefully. I'm playing as Black and have several pieces: a king on h8, rooks on b8, a bishop on e6, and pawns on a7, b7, d6.

Looking at the position, I notice:
- My king is on h8 with the rook on b8, so I still have castling rights
- My bishop on e6 is active and controls several diagonals
- White's king is on d3, quite exposed

Among my options, I see a strong move with my bishop. The bishop on e6 can attack White's king and pawn structure.

I'll make a move with my bishop to put pressure on White's position:

Looking at the legal moves, I notice I have tactical opportunities with my bishop on d5. I can also improve my rook's position or make king moves.

The most important factors to consider:
1. Safety of my king
2. Activity of my pieces
3. Potential threats against White's king on e5

The bishop on d5 is very active and controls important diagonals. I can use it to create threats or improve my position. Moving the bishop to e6 would control important squares and put pressure on White's position.

Looking at my options:
- I have a powerful bishop on e6 controlling diagonals
- My rook on b8 is active
- I should consider both defensive and attacking possibilities

The most promising move appears to be using my bishop to attack White's position. The bishop on e6 can move to g4, putting pressure on White's king at e5 without immediate counterattack.

- My bishop on g4 is active and controls important diagonals
- My rook on b8 can move along the 8th rank or down the b-file
- I have a material advantage (rook + bishop vs no major pieces for White)

The strongest move appears to be to use my rook to control the back rank and potentially prepare for checkmate:

- Pawns on a7 and d6

White has:
- A king on f6
- Pawns on b2, b5, and h5

This appears to be an endgame position where I have a material advantage with a rook and bishop versus just White's king and pawns.

Looking at my options, I notice I can use my rook to control the e-file. Since White's king is on f6, I can put pressure by moving my rook to e6, which would control important squares and potentially threaten White's king.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

I see my legal moves now. Let me analyze the position:

I'm playing as Black with my king on h8. White has a queen on b8 and king on f2. I have a rook on e5, a bishop on g4, and pawns on a7 and d6.

Looking at my options:
1. h8h7 - Moving my king to h7
2. h8g7 - Moving my king to g7
3. e6e8 - This appears to be a rook move from e6 to e8, but I see my rook is actually on e5, so this might be an error

The most critical factor is my king's safety. White's queen on b8 is not directly attacking my king, but I need to be careful about potential checks.

Moving to g7 (h8g7) would put me on a diagonal with White's queen, which could be dangerous. Moving to h7 (h8h7) keeps me safer from the queen.

I'll make my move:

I need to analyze this position carefully. I'm playing as Black and I see:

- I have my king on h7
- My rook on e6
- My bishop on g4
- Pawns on a7 and d6
- White has a queen on d8, king on f2, and pawns on b5 and h5

The most pressing issue is that White's queen on d8 is threatening my position. I need to consider my best defensive options.

Looking at my legal moves, I have several strong candidates:
1. `e6e8` - Moving my rook to the 8th rank to potentially counter the queen
2. `g4h5` - Capturing White's pawn with my bishop
3. `e6h6` - Moving my rook to protect the h-file near my king

After careful consideration, I believe the best move is to move my rook to protect against potential threats along the h-file while maintaining control of the 6th rank.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

I need to analyze this position carefully as Black.

Key observations:
- I have my king on g7, a rook on h6, a bishop on g4, and pawns on a7 and d6
- White has a queen on c8 which is threatening my position
- My bishop on g4 is undefended but has several possible moves
- My king on g7 is somewhat exposed

Looking at the critical threats:
- The white queen on c8 is threatening my bishop on g4
- I need to either move the bishop or create counterplay

Best options:
1. g4c8 - Capturing the white queen with my bishop would be the strongest move if it's legal
2. h6e6 - Moving my rook to control the e-file could create counterplay
3. g4e6 - Moving my bishop to protect the d-pawn and control key squares

Since g4c8 is available and would capture the white queen, this is clearly the best move.

Let me check what legal moves I have available.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Now I can see all my legal moves. Let me analyze the position:

1. My rook on h6 is currently undefended and under potential threat from the white king.
2. I have a bishop on c8 that could be developed to create threats.
3. My king on g7 is relatively safe for now.

Looking at my options, I see a few strong candidates:
- Moving the rook along the 6th rank (h6g6, h6f6, h6e6) to maintain control while moving away from the white king
- Developing the bishop to create threats (particularly c8f5 which would attack the white king)
- Advancing pawns to create space

The move c8f5 looks particularly strong as it develops the bishop with a check on the white king, forcing white to respond to the check rather than attacking my pieces.

Thank you for providing the legal moves. Now I can analyze the position and make a strong move.

Looking at the position, I notice several key factors:
1. I have a material advantage with a rook and bishop vs no pieces for White
2. White's king is exposed on h4
3. I can potentially deliver checkmate or win material

The most promising moves appear to be:
- h6h5: Capturing White's pawn and attacking the king
- f5h3: Moving the bishop to attack White's king with check

Let me choose the strongest move. The rook capture on h5 directly attacks White's king and removes a defender, creating immediate threats.

I notice my rook on h5 is attacking White's king on g6, which is a check. I should capitalize on this opportunity. The best move is to capture the White king with my rook.

Looking at the position, I notice several important factors:
1. I have a material advantage with a rook and bishop versus just a pawn for White
2. White's king is on f3, and my rook on g5 is already putting pressure on the g-file
3. My bishop on f5 controls several important diagonals

One of the strongest moves appears to be moving my rook to g3+, which would deliver check and potentially lead to a winning position. This would immediately attack the white king and force a response.

- I can advance my pawns (a7a6, a7a5, d6d5)

Since I'm ahead in material (bishop + 2 pawns vs 1 pawn), I should try to advance one of my pawns toward promotion. The d-pawn is more advanced, so pushing it is a good idea.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

I see the current position and my legal moves. Let me analyze the situation:

I'm playing as Black with a king on g8, a bishop on g6, and pawns on a7 and d5. White has a king on e5 and a pawn on b5.

Looking at my options:
- I have a bishop that can move in several directions
- My d5 pawn can advance
- My a7 pawn can advance one or two squares
- My king can move to several squares

Since White's king is on e5, I should be careful about potential threats. The bishop on g6 is currently well-positioned, controlling several diagonals. 

I think advancing my d-pawn is a good idea to create a passed pawn and potentially promote it later. This would force White to deal with this threat.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

I need to analyze this position carefully.

I see that I'm playing as Black with:
- A king on g8
- A bishop on g6
- Pawns on a7 and d4

White has:
- A king on f5
- A pawn on b5

Looking at my options:
1. The bishop on g6 has several diagonal moves available
2. I can move my king (h7h8, h7g8, h7g7, h7h6)
3. I can advance either of my pawns

The most important factor is safety of my king and creating winning chances. The bishop is a powerful piece here, and I should use it effectively.

I'll play the bishop move g6e4, which attacks White's king on f5 and puts it in check. This forces White to respond to the check and gives me the initiative.

Now I understand the position and my available moves. I'm playing as Black with my king on h7 and pawns on a7 and d4. White has a king on e4 and a pawn on b4.

Looking at my options:
- I can move my king in several directions (h8, g8, g7, h6, g6)
- I can advance my a-pawn (a6, a5)
- I can advance my d-pawn (d3)

The most critical factor here is my king's safety. With the white king on e4, it's approaching my position, so I should keep my king active. Moving to g6 would be a good choice as it maintains distance from the white king while staying centralized.

Looking at the position:
- My king is on g6 and can move to several squares
- I have a pawn on a7 that can advance to a6 or a5
- White's king is on d4 and pawn on b4

Since this is an endgame position, I need to consider:
1. Advancing my pawn toward promotion
2. Using my king effectively

The best plan is to advance my pawn while keeping my king active. Moving my pawn two squares allows it to advance quickly while still being protected.

- White king on e4
- White pawn on b4

Let me check what legal moves I have as Black.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

I see my legal moves. Let's analyze this position:

I have a pawn on a4 that can promote if it reaches a1, and my king is on g6. The white king is on e4 with a pawn on b4.

The key decision is whether to move my king or push my pawn. Since the notation shows "a5a4" as a legal move, it seems there might be a typo in the board representation or the legal moves list, as my pawn is already on a4 according to the board.

Looking at the king moves, I need to consider:
1. The race between my a-pawn and White's b-pawn
2. The position of the white king, which is currently heading toward my pawn

The best strategy is to advance my a-pawn while keeping my king in a position to stop White's pawn if needed. Since my pawn is already on a4, I should move my king to support its advance.

Since my pawn can make progress and there's no immediate threat to my king, I'll advance my pawn.

White has played f4 and g3, which is a bit unusual. I should respond by developing my pieces and contesting the center. One of the strongest moves here is to develop my knight to f6, which attacks White's pawn on e4, develops a piece, and helps control the center.

- 'get_legal_moves' to get a UCI formatted list of available moves
- 'make_move <UCI formatted move>' when you are ready to complete your turn (e.g., 'make_move e2e4')

I can see the current position. White has played f4 and g3, and has moved the king to f2 (which is unusual this early). As Black, I've developed my knight to f6 and pushed my e-pawn to e5.

Let me check what legal moves I have available.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

After analyzing the position, I see several good options. Since White has played an unusual early king move to f2, I should look to develop my pieces and potentially exploit this.

The most principled move is to develop my knight to c6, which controls the center and prepares for castling. This follows good opening principles of developing pieces, controlling the center, and working toward king safety.

I can see the current position. White has played an early king move to f2, and has also developed a bishop to g2 and pushed pawns to f4 and g3. As Black, I have a standard development with knights on c6 and f6, and I've pushed my e-pawn to e5.

Let me check what legal moves I have available.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Thank you for providing the legal moves. Now I can make an informed decision.

Looking at the position, I notice several key factors:
1. White has moved their king early to f2, which is unusual
2. I should continue development and potentially prepare to castle
3. I could consider attacking White's advanced f4 pawn with my e5 pawn

Among my options, developing the bishop to e7 looks strong as it prepares castling and develops a piece. Another good option would be to capture on f4, exploiting White's early king move.

After consideration, I'll develop my bishop to e7, which supports my central pawn, prepares castling, and maintains flexibility.

I see my available moves. I notice I can castle kingside with "e8g8", which is a strong move in this position. Castling will:

1. Bring my king to safety
2. Connect my rooks
3. Allow me to develop my queenside pieces more easily

This is a natural developing move that improves my king safety while maintaining a solid position.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

I need to analyze the position carefully before making my move.

Looking at the board, I notice:
- White has played f4, which opens the f-file and the diagonal for their bishop on f3
- My king is on g8 with a rook on f8
- I have a bishop on e7 that could be developed
- My knight on f6 is well-placed but could be improved
- The e5 pawn is advanced but potentially vulnerable

Among my options, I should consider:
1. King safety (castling is no longer possible as my king has already moved)
2. Piece development and coordination
3. Central control

One strong move is to develop my bishop from e7 to c5, putting pressure on White's kingside. This improves my piece activity and creates threats.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

I can see all my legal moves now. Let me analyze the position:

1. I notice I have castling available (e8g8) which is often a good move for king safety
2. My light-squared bishop on c5 is active and has several good options
3. I have a knight on f6 in a standard development square
4. White has advanced a pawn to f4, creating some tension in the center

Given the position, castling kingside seems like the best move. It will immediately improve my king safety and connect my rooks. This is a fundamental strategic priority in the middlegame.

I can see the board and my legal moves. Let me analyze the position:

I'm playing as Black and I notice:
- White has a bishop on c3 attacking my bishop on c5
- My knight on f6 is well-positioned
- I have a pawn on e5 that could be advanced or protected
- My king is on g8 with a rook on h8

Looking at my options, I should focus on development and king safety. The bishop on c5 is under attack from White's bishop on c3, so I should consider moving it. Moving it to e7 would be solid, developing while protecting my king.

Looking at the board, I see White has a pawn on d4 that could be captured by my e5 pawn. This would help me control the center and potentially create more space for my pieces.

I'll capture the pawn on d4:

- My bishop on e7 could be developed
- I can consider pawn advances to control more space
- White has some pieces developed and the king on f2

One strong move would be to develop my bishop to c5, putting pressure on White's kingside. This move also improves my piece activity and prepares for potential attacks.

Looking at my options, I notice my knight on e4 has several strong moves. Particularly interesting is e4f2+, which would be a check on White's king.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

I need to analyze this position carefully. Here's what I observe:

1. Material is roughly even
2. My king is on g8 with a rook on f8 nearby
3. I have a knight on f2 that's deep in White's territory - this is a strong piece
4. White has a pawn on f4 that could be vulnerable

The knight on f2 is particularly interesting as it's attacking White's queen on d1 and bishop on d3 simultaneously. I should consider how to best use this tactical advantage.

Among my options:
- I could capture White's bishop with Nf2xd3
- I could capture White's queen with Nf2xd1, though this might be a trap
- I could move the knight to e4, maintaining pressure

After careful consideration, I'll capture the bishop on d3, which seems to be the safest way to gain material.

Among my options, I see some strong knight moves from d3. The knight on d3 is very active and can potentially fork pieces or attack key squares.

I'll play the knight move d3f4, attacking White's pawn on g2 while maintaining my knight's strong central position.

2. I could develop my queen with moves like d8e7
3. I could consider pawn advances to improve my position

After evaluating the position, I think the strongest move is to move my knight to e6, creating a threat against the white queen while developing my piece to a strong central square.

After analyzing the position, I can see I'm playing as Black and have several options. I notice:

1. My king is on g8 with a rook on f8 missing
2. White has a queen on d3 and is applying some pressure
3. I have knights on f6 and e5, and bishops on e6 and b8

One of my strongest moves appears to be advancing my e-pawn from e3 to e2, which threatens promotion and creates immediate counterplay.

Among my options, I think developing my pieces and improving my king safety is important. The move e6-f4 looks particularly strong as it:
1. Develops my bishop to an active diagonal
2. Puts pressure on White's position
3. Threatens the pawn on c1 (indirectly)

2. My king is on g8 with potential to castle or move
3. I have a knight on f6 with multiple options
4. White has a queen on d4 that's threatening my position

The most powerful move I see is to attack the white queen with my knight on f4:

make_move f4d3

This captures White's queen, which is a major material gain. Taking the queen is clearly the best move in this position as it wins a major piece without any immediate compensation for White.

After analyzing the position, I see that I'm playing as Black and there are several interesting options. 

I notice that White's queen is on d4, and I have a knight on d3 that's currently attacking it. However, the knight is undefended, so capturing the queen would likely lead to losing the knight.

Looking at the position more carefully, I see that my king is on g8, and I have a bishop on f6 that can make several moves. One particularly strong move would be to develop my knight on d3 to a more active position.

The move Nd3-f4 looks particularly strong as it attacks White's king on e2 while also maintaining pressure. This creates a tactical threat that White must respond to.

Looking at the board, I notice:
- White has a queen on d4 threatening my position
- I have knights on f4 and f6 that could be developed
- My king is on g8 with potential safety concerns

Among my options, I see several strong candidates:
- Knight moves like f6e4 (but this isn't in my legal moves)
- King safety moves like g8f8 or g8e8
- Developing my rook with b8a8

The knight on f4 has several good options. I think the best move is to activate this knight with:

make_move f4e6

This move:
1. Develops my knight to a more central position
2. Controls important central squares
3. Creates potential threats against White's position
4. Improves my piece coordination

- I have knights on e5 and f6, and bishops on e6 and b8
- My king is on g8 with rooks on b8 and h8

Among my options:
- I could castle by playing g8f8 (O-O-O)
- I could develop my bishop with e6f4, attacking White's queen
- Knight moves like f6e4 could improve my position

After consideration, I'll play my bishop to f4, attacking White's queen while developing my piece to an active square.

I need to analyze this position carefully. 

I notice White's queen is on e5, attacking my bishop on f6. My knight on f4 is also active and could potentially fork White's pieces. The position seems complex with various tactical possibilities.

Looking at the legal moves, I see several key options:
- Defending my bishop with moves like g7g6
- Moving my knight to create threats (f4g6, f4e6, etc.)
- Castling options (g8f8, g8e8)
- Queen moves (d8e7, d8e8, d8f8)

The most pressing issue is my bishop on f6 being under attack by White's queen. I should either move it or defend it. Additionally, my knight on f4 is well-positioned and could create threats.

I'll make a move that both defends my bishop and maintains a solid position:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

After analyzing the position, I see several key factors:

1. White's queen is on e5, attacking my knight on f4
2. My knight on f4 is attacking White's bishop on e5
3. White's queen is also threatening my bishop on f6

The most critical issue is my knight on f4, which is under attack but also has several potential moves. I need to decide whether to capture the bishop on e5, retreat, or make a different move.

Looking at the position more deeply, capturing the bishop with Nxe5 would expose my knight to White's queen, so that's not good. I should either move the knight to a safe square or defend it.

Among my options, I think the best move is to retreat my knight to g2, which attacks White's rook on h1 and gets out of the queen's attack.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

I need to analyze this position carefully. 

Looking at the board, I notice:
- White's queen is on e5, attacking my f6 bishop
- White has a bishop on e4 and a rook on h6
- My king is on g8 with a rook on h8
- I have a knight on g2 that appears to be active

The most pressing issue is my bishop on f6 being under attack by White's queen. I should either move it or defend it. Moving my knight from g2 to e3 looks particularly strong as it would attack White's king on d4 with a discovered check from my bishop on d7.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

I need to analyze this position carefully. 

I notice that White's queen is on e5, attacking my knight on e3. My knight on e3 is also attacking White's king on d4, which is a check. This is a critical tactical situation.

Looking at the legal moves, I see that my knight on e3 has several options, including capturing the queen on e5 with "e3e5". However, this would leave my king exposed.

The most pressing issue is addressing the check to White's king. Since I'm playing as Black and it's my move, this means White just moved into check (possibly by mistake) or there's a misunderstanding in the position.

Given the unusual situation where White's king is in check on my turn, I'll make the strongest move by capturing the queen:

I see all my legal moves now. Since White has played the English Opening (1.c4), I have several good responses. The most principled approaches would be:

1. e5 - Taking central space and preparing for a reversed Sicilian structure
2. c5 - Creating a symmetrical position
3. Nf6 - Developing a knight and preparing for various setups

I'll go with the solid and flexible Knight development to f6, which is one of the most common responses to the English Opening.

White has played an early g4, which weakens the kingside somewhat. White has also developed the knight to f3 and pushed c3, likely preparing for d4.

As Black, I should focus on development and central control. Some good candidate moves include:
- e7e5: Taking central space
- d7d5: Controlling the center
- e7e6: Preparing to develop the light-squared bishop
- Development moves like c6e5 (knight to e5)

I think the most principled response is to stake a claim in the center.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

After analyzing the position and the available legal moves, I need to make a strategic decision.

I notice that White has developed their queen early to b2, which is somewhat unusual. My knight on g4 is attacking White's pawn on h2, but it's not a real threat since White can easily defend it. I also see that I've played e5, creating some space in the center.

One of my priorities should be to continue development. I have several good developing moves available:
- Developing the bishop with f8e7 or f8d6
- Developing the knight with c6e7 or c6d4
- Castling with h8g8 (kingside)

Among these options, I think developing the bishop to e7 (f8e7) is most natural. It protects my e5 pawn, develops a piece, and prepares for kingside castling.

- My pawn structure is intact, with a pawn on e5 controlling the center

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Thank you for providing the legal moves. I notice that I have the option to castle kingside with "e8g8" which is an excellent move in this position. Castling will:

1. Bring my king to safety
2. Connect my rooks
3. Develop my h8 rook to the g-file

This is a natural developing move that improves my king safety while activating my rook. Given the current position, castling kingside is a priority as my king is still in the center.

1. I'm playing as Black and appear to be in the middle of a game
2. White's queen is on c2, which is quite active
3. I have knights on c6 and g4, with the g4 knight being particularly active
4. My king is on g8 with the rook still on h8
5. I have a bishop pair on e7 and c8

Looking at my options, I notice my knight on g4 has several strong possibilities. It can attack White's kingside or potentially fork pieces. The e5 pawn is also advanced.

One of the strongest moves appears to be moving my knight from g4 to e3, which would fork White's queen and potentially another piece while also attacking the center.

You are a professional chess player and you play as black. Now is your turn to make a move. Before making a move you can pick one of the following actions:
- 'get_current_board' to get the schema and current status of the board
- 'get_legal_moves' to get a UCI formatted list of available moves
- 'make_move <UCI formatted move>' when you are ready to complete your turn (e.g., 'make_move e2e4')

Looking at the position, I'll develop my knight from d1 to e3, which puts pressure on the center and develops a piece to a good square.

I notice I have two knights - one on e3 and one on f5, both in good positions. My bishops are on e7 and f8, and I still have castling options available.

One strong move would be to develop my knight on e3 to g4, creating pressure on White's kingside and potentially threatening f2. This knight move also increases my control of the center and creates tactical possibilities.

One strong move would be to play Nf5-d4, attacking White's c-pawn while maintaining a strong central position for my knight.

You are a professional chess player and you play as black. Now is your turn to make a move. Before making a move you can pick one of the following actions:
- 'get_current_board' to get the schema and current status of the board
- 'get_legal_moves' to get a UCI formatted list of available moves
- 'make_move <UCI formatted move>' when you are ready to complete your turn (e.g., 'make_move e2e4')

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

After analyzing the position and my available moves, I see several key factors:

1. My king is on g8 with limited mobility
2. I have two knights (e4 and f5) that are actively placed
3. I have a bishop on e7 that could be developed
4. White has a rook on c3 that's penetrated my position

One of my strongest moves appears to be developing my bishop with e7c5, which would:
- Develop the bishop to an active diagonal
- Put pressure on White's position
- Improve my piece coordination

I'll make this move:

5. White has a rook on c3 that's oddly placed

One of my strongest moves appears to be developing my bishop on c5 to f2, which would attack White's king on d4 and potentially win material.

make_move d4c3

This move attacks White's king directly, creating a powerful check. It forces White to respond to the immediate threat while I continue to develop my position. This bishop move puts immediate pressure on White and could lead to material gain or a tactical advantage.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

After analyzing the position, I can see several key features:
- White has a bishop on a7 attacking my rook on a8
- My knight on f5 is active and has several good options
- My bishop on c3 is also well-placed and threatening
- My king on g8 needs safety

One of the strongest moves I see is to develop my knight on e2 to g3, creating threats against White's position.

- 'get_legal_moves' to get a UCI formatted list of available moves
- 'make_move <UCI formatted move>' when you are ready to complete your turn (e.g., 'make_move e2e4')

Player_Black (to Proxy):

After analyzing the position and available moves, I notice several key factors:

1. My king is on g8 with limited mobility
2. I have two knights (f5 and g3) that are actively placed
3. I have a bishop on c3 that's also well positioned
4. White has a bishop on a7 that's somewhat oddly placed

One of my strongest moves appears to be the knight on g3 moving to e4, which would:
- Attack the center of the board
- Potentially threaten White's pieces
- Improve my knight's position to a more central square

This move would increase my control of the center and create more tactical possibilities.

4. There's a bishop on c3 that could be developed further

One strong move I see is to improve my king's safety by castling (which appears as king movement in UCI notation since the rook moves automatically):

Looking at my options, I see a particularly strong move with my knight on f5. I can play Nf5-d4, which:
- Centralizes my knight in a powerful outpost
- Attacks White's c2 pawn
- Maintains pressure on White's position
- Prepares potential knight forks in the future

Player_Black (to Proxy):

After analyzing the position and available moves, I see several key factors:

1. My king is exposed on g8 with a white rook on c6 and bishop on a7 creating pressure
2. I have two knights (on e4 and e2) and a bishop on c3 that are active
3. White has a rook on c6 that's penetrated my position

One of my strongest moves appears to be moving my queen to protect the king and potentially threaten counterplay:

Player_Black (to Proxy):

After analyzing the position and my available legal moves, I'll make my decision.

The position is quite complex with several pieces developed. I notice I have a bishop on c3 and knights on e2 and e4, with my king on g8. White has a rook on c6 and a bishop on a7, which is putting pressure on my position.

I should prioritize king safety and piece coordination. One strong move would be to develop my knight on e4 to a better position where it can attack or defend key squares.

I notice several key aspects of the position:
- I have two knights (on f6 and e2) and two bishops (on c3 and e2)
- White has a bishop on a7 that's currently attacking my pawn on b7
- I need to consider both my attacking opportunities and defensive needs

After evaluating the available moves, I see that knight e2 has some strong options. Moving it to g3 would create a fork threat against White's king on d3 and the rook on a3.

Looking at the board, I notice:
- Material seems roughly equal
- White has a bishop on a7 that's attacking my pawn on b7
- I have knights on f6 and g3 in active positions
- My bishop on c3 is also well placed
- My king is on e8 and castling might be a priority

Among my options:
- I could castle with e8f8 or e8g8
- I could develop pieces further
- I could address the threat to my b7 pawn

The most principled move here is to castle kingside to improve my king safety:

I notice several interesting features of the position:
- I have two knights (f6 and g3) and two bishops (c3 and f8) actively placed
- White has a bishop on a7 that's somewhat out of play
- My king is on g8 with some pawn protection

Looking at the legal moves, I see several tactical opportunities:

1. The knight on g3 has several good options, including potentially attacking pieces
2. The bishop on c3 has diagonal control
3. I could develop my rook on a8 or f8

After evaluation, I think the knight move g3-e4 looks strong - it centralizes my knight, attacks the center, and could potentially threaten White's position.

I need to analyze this position carefully. 

Looking at the board, I notice:
- White has a bishop on a7 and rooks on a1 and a6
- Black has material advantage with two knights (e4 and f6), two bishops (c3 and f8), a queen, and both rooks
- White's king is exposed on c2
- There appears to be potential for tactical opportunities

Among my legal moves, I see several promising options:
1. Knight e4 to f2 (e4f2) - forking White's king and rook
2. Knight e4 to d2 (e4d2) - checking the king
3. Bishop c3 to e1 (c3e1) - checking the king

The knight fork e4f2 looks particularly strong as it attacks both the king and rook simultaneously. This would force the king to move, allowing me to capture the rook on a1.

You are a professional chess player and you play as black. Now is your turn to make a move. Before making a move you can pick one of the following actions:
- 'get_current_board' to get the schema and current status of the board
- 'get_legal_moves' to get a UCI formatted list of available moves
- 'make_move <UCI formatted move>' when you are ready to complete your turn (e.g., 'make_move e2e4')

Player_Black (to Proxy):

After analyzing the position and my legal moves, I notice several important factors:

1. My king on g8 seems safe for now
2. I have a bishop on c3 that's actively placed and threatening the white king area
3. I have knights on f6 and e4 in good positions
4. White has a bishop on a7 that's somewhat out of play

One of my strongest pieces is the knight on e4, which is centralized and has multiple good options. I can increase pressure on White's position by moving this knight to c5, which attacks the white pawn on a4 and maintains a strong central presence.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Let me analyze the position:

I notice I'm playing as Black and the position is quite complex. White has a bishop on a7 and a rook on a6, creating pressure on my queenside. I have knights on f6 and c5, and bishops on c3 and a8.

Looking at the legal moves, I should consider:
1. Developing my pieces and improving my position
2. Addressing any immediate threats
3. Creating counterplay where possible

The knight on c5 has several good options, including e4 which would attack White's position. The knight on f6 also has tactical possibilities.

After evaluation, I believe one of the strongest moves is to play my knight to e4, which attacks the center and creates pressure:

2. I have a bishop on c3 that appears to be attacking White's position
3. White has a bishop on a7 that's infiltrated my position

Looking at my options, I notice the knight on e4 has several strong moves. In particular, the move e4f2 looks very powerful as it would be a fork attacking White's king on b2 and rook on a1 simultaneously.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

After analyzing the position and the legal moves, I see several key factors:

1. My king is on g8 with the rook on a8 - castling is no longer an option
2. I have a bishop on e1 that's attacking diagonally
3. I have knights on e4 and d3 that could be developed
4. White has a rook on e5 that's quite active

One of the strongest moves I see is to develop my knight on e4 to f2, creating a fork between White's king on b2 and rook on a2. This would win material.

- My king is on g8 with a rook on a8
- My queen is on f7

One of my strongest moves appears to be moving my knight from d3 to f4, which would attack White's king on b3 while also potentially threatening the rook on e5.

4. White has a rook on e5 that's quite active

One strong move I see is to develop my bishop on e1 with a check to White's king on b3:

This move:
- Delivers check to the white king
- Develops my bishop to an active square
- Threatens the white rook on a1

Player_Black (to Proxy):

After analyzing the position, I see several important factors:
- White has a rook on e5 attacking my e-pawn
- My king is exposed on g8
- I have two knights that could develop into active positions
- My queen on f7 is well-placed but could be more active

One of the strongest moves I see is to develop my knight with a threat:

make_move e2c1

This knight move attacks White's king on b3, creating an immediate threat. It develops a piece while putting pressure on my opponent, forcing them to respond to the check. This is a strong tactical opportunity that I should capitalize on.

3. I have two knights and two bishops, giving me good minor piece coordination

One of the strongest moves I see is to develop my knight with a threat:

make_move c4e3

This knight move to e3 creates multiple threats:
- It attacks White's king on a4
- It creates a fork between the king and rook on a1
- It's a protected square since my bishop on c3 defends it

This move should force White to respond to the immediate threats and give me tactical advantages.

2. White has a rook on f6 that's attacking my f7 queen
3. I have knights on e3 and c1, bishops on a5 and c3
4. White's king is exposed on a4

The most pressing issue is my queen on f7 being attacked by White's rook on f6. I need to address this immediately.

Looking at my options, I can:
- Move the queen to safety
- Capture the attacking rook with my knight on e3

The knight capture seems strongest as it removes the threat while gaining material.

I apologize for the error. Let me check the legal moves again and make a valid move.

Looking at the legal moves list, I see that e3f6 isn't actually available. Let me reconsider the position.

The queen on f7 is under attack from the white rook on f6. Since I can't capture the rook with my knight, I need to move my queen to safety. Among the queen moves, I should choose one that maintains activity.

The move f7e6 looks good - it moves the queen to safety while maintaining control of important central squares and keeping pressure on White's position.

4. I have a bishop on a5 that could potentially deliver a check

Looking at the legal moves, I need to prioritize saving my queen. Among the queen moves, I should look for one that maintains control while possibly creating threats.

The move e6f7 looks strong as it:
- Saves the queen from the rook attack
- Maintains control of important central squares
- Protects the g7 pawn
- Keeps the queen active in the center

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

I can see that I have two legal moves as Black: either move my king from h8 to g7 or move my rook from h8 to g7.

Looking at the position, I notice:
- My king is on h8 and White's king is on a4
- I have a queen on a6 which is a powerful piece
- White has a rook on a5 and a bishop on e5
- The position appears to be in an endgame phase

Moving my king to g7 would be safer than moving my rook there, as it gets my king away from the back rank and starts activating it for the endgame. This is generally good king positioning in endgames.

After analyzing the position, I see several promising options. I notice I have a queen on e6 with many possible moves, and my king is on h8 with the option to move to g8.

Looking at the position, I see White has a bishop on c3 and a rook on c1, with the white king on a3. I have a strong position with my queen on e6 controlling many squares.

One of the strongest moves appears to be moving my queen to check the white king:

One of the strongest moves here would be to move my queen to attack the white king directly:

Player_Black (to Proxy):

I need to analyze this position carefully. I'm playing as Black and I notice several important features:

1. Material: I have two rooks, two bishops, and several pawns, while White has a rook, a bishop, and fewer pawns. I have a material advantage.

2. King safety: My king is on h8, and White's king is exposed on b4.

3. Immediate threats: White's bishop on a7 is attacking my rook on a8.

Looking at my options, I see several strong moves:

- I could move my king with h8g8 to get out of the back rank
- I could move my rook on g7 to threaten White's king
- I could develop my bishop on a5 to put pressure on White's position

The most forcing move appears to be moving my rook on g7 to threaten White's king. Since the king is on b4 and my rook is on g7, I can move it to g4, creating a direct threat.

After analyzing the position, I see several key elements:

1. I'm playing as Black and have two rooks (a8, g4), two bishops (a5, c8), and my king on h8
2. White's king is exposed on b4 with a rook on a4
3. I have a pawn on e4 that could advance

Looking at my options, I notice I can deliver a powerful check with my rook:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

I apologize for the error. Let me check the legal moves again and make a valid move.

Looking at the list of legal moves, I see that g4b4 isn't actually legal. Let me select a strong move from the available options.

The rook on g4 has several good options. I can put pressure on White's position by moving it to the g-file or h-file. Since White's king is on b4, I'll focus on controlling the board and improving my position.

1. I have a king on g8, rooks on a8 and g2, bishops on c8 and a4, and pawns on b7, c7, d7, e4, and h7
2. White has a king on b4, a rook on a4, a bishop on b6, and a pawn on b2

I need to check what legal moves I have available.

After analyzing the position and legal moves, I see several strong options. My rook on g2 is very active and threatening White's position. I also have a bishop on a5 that could capture White's bishop on b6.

The most immediate threat I see is my rook on g2 attacking White's undefended b2 pawn. Capturing this pawn would be a material gain and would create a passed pawn that could become dangerous.

3. My king is on h8, and I have a rook on c2 that's currently attacking along the 2nd rank

Looking at the legal moves, I see a strong opportunity: my rook on c2 can capture on a2, which appears to be undefended. This would win material and increase my advantage.

After analyzing the position, I see several key elements:

1. I'm playing as Black with my king on g8
2. White has a rook on d4 and a king on c3
3. I have a rook on e2 that's actively threatening White's position
4. I have a bishop on g7 that controls the long diagonal

The most powerful move I see is to use my rook on e2 to check the White king:

2. White has a rook on d4 that could be threatening
3. I have a bishop on g7 with good diagonal control
4. My king on h8 seems relatively safe

One of my strongest moves appears to be bringing my rook on b2 closer to White's king to increase pressure. Moving it to a2 would directly attack the white king.

I notice my rook on a2 is active and can potentially create threats. I also have a bishop on g7 that could be developed more actively. My king on h8 appears safe for now.

Looking at the position strategically, I see that:
1. My rook on a2 is already active on the second rank and threatening White's position
2. Moving my bishop from g7 could develop it more actively
3. I could advance some pawns to gain space

Among my options, I think the most powerful move is to bring my rook on a2 to the seventh rank, creating immediate threats against White's position.

I need to analyze this position carefully. 

I see that White has a rook on e4 and the White king is on b3. My king is on h8, and I have material advantage with two rooks, two bishops, and several pawns.

The White rook on e4 is attacking my e-pawn. I should address this threat. I could push the e-pawn with e4e3, but that would leave it vulnerable.

Looking at my options, I notice I can develop my bishop from g7 to e5, which would attack the White rook. This would be a strong move that develops a piece while creating a threat.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Thank you for providing the legal moves. Let me analyze the position and make a strong move.

I notice that my bishop on e4 can capture the white king on c3 with the move e4c3. However, this move isn't listed in the legal moves, which means there must be some piece blocking or protecting the king that isn't visible in the board representation.

Looking at my options, I see that my bishop on e5 (which appears as e4 in the board display but must be e5 based on the legal moves) can attack the white king with e5c3. This is a check and appears in the legal moves list.

Since putting the opponent's king in check is usually a strong move that forces a response, I'll play this move.

Looking at the position, I see I'm playing as Black and I have a significant material advantage with two rooks and two bishops against just a white king. This is clearly a winning position for me.

I notice a few key opportunities:
- I can develop my bishop to g7 which would control the long diagonal
- I can advance my pawns to create passed pawns
- I can use my rooks to control open files

One of the strongest moves here is to place my bishop on g7, which controls the long diagonal and helps secure my king's position while maintaining pressure on the center and queenside.

I'll analyze the position:

I'm playing as Black and I see we're in an endgame situation. I have my king on h8, two rooks (a8 and a7), two bishops (c8 and g7), and several pawns. White's king is on c2, quite far from my king.

Looking at my options:
- I could develop my king with h8g8 to improve its position
- I could move my light-squared bishop (g7) to various squares
- I could advance my pawns or move my rooks

The most active and strong move appears to be to improve my king's position while maintaining the protection of the h7 pawn:

I can see the available legal moves now. Let me analyze the position:

I'm playing as Black and have a material advantage with two rooks, two bishops, and several pawns. White's king is exposed on d2, which presents tactical opportunities.

Looking at my options, I notice my bishop on g7 has a long diagonal that could potentially target White's king. Moving it to e5 would put pressure on the king and control important central squares.

I'll make this move:

I can see this is an endgame position where I'm playing as Black. I have a material advantage with two rooks, two bishops, and several pawns against just a white king. Let's analyze the position:

1. My king is on g8
2. I have rooks on a8 and a7
3. Bishops on c8 and e5
4. Pawns on b7, c7, d7, e4, and h7
5. White's king is on e2

Looking at the position, I should aim to coordinate my pieces for a checkmate. The bishop on e5 is particularly active and controls important squares.

I'll make a move that improves my position and maintains control. Moving my bishop to control more of the board while keeping pressure on White's king seems good.

3. I have bishops on c8 and d2
4. I have pawns on b7, c7, d7, e4, and h7
5. White's king is on e5

Looking at the position, I notice my bishop on d2 is attacking the white king on e5. This is a check position. I should capitalize on this advantage.

Among my legal moves, I see I can move the bishop to several squares. The best move would be to maintain control while advancing my position. Moving the bishop to e3 maintains the check and controls important central squares.

After analyzing the position, I can see that I'm playing as Black with a significant material advantage. I have two rooks, a bishop, and several pawns against White's lone king on e5.

Looking at my legal moves, I should aim to coordinate my pieces to deliver checkmate. The White king is currently on e5, and I can work toward restricting its movement and delivering mate.

A strong move would be to advance my d-pawn to d5, which controls important squares and helps restrict the White king's mobility. This also supports potential future attacks.

Thank you for the list of legal moves. Looking at this position, I have a completely winning advantage with my two rooks, bishop, and pawns against White's lone king.

The most direct approach is to aim for checkmate. Since White's king is on d1, I can use my rook on a7 to deliver checkmate by moving it to a1.

After analyzing the position and legal moves, I'll make my decision.

I notice I have a strong position with two rooks and a bishop. The white king is exposed on c3, which presents tactical opportunities.

One of the strongest moves here is to use my rook on a1 to control the first rank, cutting off the white king's escape routes.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

I need to analyze the position carefully before making my move.

Looking at the board, I see that:
- I'm Black with my king on g8
- White's king is on b2
- I have a rook on a8 and another on c1
- I have a bishop on e6
- White seems to have no pieces except the king

This is a very favorable position for me. I have a material advantage and can work toward checkmate. One of the strongest moves would be to use my rook on c1 to control the second rank, preventing the white king's movement.

Now I can see all my legal moves. Let's analyze the position:

I have a significant material advantage with a rook, bishop, and several pawns against just White's king. My goal should be to efficiently checkmate White's king on c2.

The most direct approach would be to use my rook to deliver checkmate. I can move my rook to a2, which would be an immediate checkmate since the White king on c2 would have no escape squares.

- Stakes a claim in the center
- Opens lines for my bishop and queen
- Prepares for a solid development

You are a professional chess player and you play as black. Now is your turn to make a move. Before making a move you can pick one of the following actions:
- 'get_current_board' to get the schema and current status of the board
- 'get_legal_moves' to get a UCI formatted list of available moves
- 'make_move <UCI formatted move>' when you are ready to complete your turn (e.g., 'make_move e2e4')

Player_Black (to Proxy):

After analyzing the position, I see that my e5 pawn is under attack from White's f4 pawn. I have several good options here:

1. I could capture the f4 pawn with e5xf4
2. I could develop pieces like Bf8-e7 or Nc6-d4
3. I could protect the e5 pawn with a move like Nf6-d5

The strongest move here is to capture the undefended pawn on f4, which relieves the pressure on my e5 square and gains material.

After analyzing the position, I can see that:

1. White has developed their queen to b3 and has a knight on c3
2. My knight on f6 is developed, and I have another knight on b4 attacking White's queen
3. The pawn structure is still mostly intact, with a pawn on f4 advanced

Given this position, I should prioritize:
- Development of my pieces
- Protecting my knight on b4 which is currently undefended
- Considering the safety of my king

The move Nc6 (b4c6) looks strong as it develops my knight to a good central square while retreating from the attack. This is a natural developing move that improves my position.

1. White has moved the queen to b3, attacking my f7 pawn
2. White has advanced a pawn to a4
3. I need to address the threat to my f7 pawn

Among my options:
- I could defend f7 with moves like e8e7 (King move) or d8e7 (Queen move)
- I could develop pieces with moves like f8e7 (Bishop development)
- Knight moves like f6e4 could counter-attack

The most principled move is to develop my bishop to e7, which both develops a piece and defends the f7 pawn that's under attack from White's queen.

Given this position, castling kingside would be a strong move to improve my king's safety. This is typically a priority in the opening/early middlegame.

One of my strongest moves appears to be developing my knight to e4, which would attack White's queen while also establishing a strong central position. This knight move would be supported by my f-pawn.

After analyzing the position, I see several good options. I notice my king is on h8 and I have a rook on f8, which means I can castle queenside with "f8g8". This would improve my king's safety and connect my rooks.

I also see that my bishop on e7 has several possible moves, and my knight on c6 can develop to various squares.

Given the position, I think castling is my priority to improve king safety and rook coordination.

I'll play a solid developing move that improves my position and prepares for castling:

make_move g8f8

This move begins the process of castling kingside, which will bring my king to safety. It connects my rooks and maintains my solid pawn structure. From f8, my king is safer and I can continue developing my pieces harmoniously.

1. The position appears to be in the middle game with an interesting pawn structure
2. My dark-squared bishop on c5 is well-placed and attacking the white king area
3. White's queen is on b3, potentially threatening my queenside
4. I have a knight on c6 that could be developed to better squares

One of the strongest moves I see is to develop my bishop on c5 to attack the white king with a check:

The bishop on f2 is particularly strong, threatening White's position. I can either maintain this pressure or consider other tactical opportunities.

Looking at the position, I'll play the bishop move f2e3, which maintains pressure on White's position while targeting the pawn on c1. This is a strong diagonal for my bishop.

After analyzing the position, I see several good options as Black. I notice I have a bishop on f2 that's actively placed deep in White's position. I also see that my knight on c6 has several potential moves.

Looking at the board, I notice White has a bishop on f4 that could be captured by my bishop on f2. This would be a good exchange since bishops are valuable pieces. Additionally, this move maintains my bishop's active position.

I apologize for the error. Let me check the legal moves again and make a valid move.

Looking at the list of legal moves, I see that my bishop on f2 can capture the bishop on f4. The correct UCI format for this move would be:

Thank you for providing the legal moves again. I see that my bishop on f2 can't directly capture on f4 as I initially thought. Looking at the legal moves for the bishop on f2, I'll choose a strong move.

The bishop on f2 is very active and I want to maintain its influence. Moving it to e3 puts pressure on White's position and controls important central squares.

1. e3f4 - Capturing the white bishop with my bishop
2. c6e5 - Defending my bishop with my knight
3. e3d4 - Moving my bishop to safety while attacking White's e-pawn

The best move here is to capture the attacking bishop:

4. I have castling options available (both h8g8 and f8g8 are legal)

After evaluating the position, I believe I should castle kingside to improve my king's safety. This is a standard developing move that will connect my rooks and get my king to safety.

- White has a queen on a3 and a bishop on d4
- I have a bishop on h2 that's actively placed
- There's a knight on c6 that could be developed further

The most pressing concern is my king's safety and developing my pieces. I see that my bishop on h2 is quite active and can make several strong moves.

One of the best moves appears to be moving my bishop from h2 to e5, which would attack White's c3 pawn while developing the piece to a strong central square.

2. White has a queen on a3 and a bishop on d4
3. My dark-squared bishop on e5 is under attack by White's pawn on d4
4. I have a knight on c6 that could potentially develop

Looking at my options, I notice my bishop on e5 is threatened and needs attention. I could capture the bishop on d4 with my bishop, but that would expose me to the white queen. 

One strong move is to develop my knight on c6 to e7, which would:
- Protect my king's position
- Prepare for potential castling
- Maintain control of central squares

I'll make this move:

- My bishop on e5 is under attack and needs attention
- I have a knight on e7 that could develop
- My king is on g8 and could use some safety

Among my options, I see that my bishop on e5 is under attack by White's queen. I need to either move it or defend it. Looking at the legal moves, I have several options for the bishop including retreating to f6, d6, f4, d4, g3, c3, or even h2.

The most principled move appears to be retreating the bishop to f6, which maintains its activity on the long diagonal while moving away from the queen's attack.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

After analyzing the position, I can see several key elements:

1. I'm playing as Black and my king is on g8
2. White's queen is on d4, creating some pressure
3. I have a knight on e7 and a bishop on f6
4. The position looks somewhat open

Among my legal moves, I should prioritize development and king safety. The knight on e7 has several good options, and I can also consider developing my rooks.

I'll move my knight from e7 to c6, which develops it to a good square, controls important central squares (d4 and e5), and prepares for potential queenside castling.

After analyzing the position, I see that White's queen on e6 is threatening my position. I need to address this immediate threat while developing my pieces.

I notice that my knight on c6 has several good options, and my bishop on f6 can also move to safer squares. The most pressing issue is protecting against White's threats.

One strong move is to develop my bishop on f6 to e7, which would protect my king and prepare for castling. This is a solid defensive move that improves my position.

After analyzing the position, I see several good options. I notice my king is on g8, and I have an opportunity to castle kingside by moving the king to f8 or e8. I also have knights and bishops that can be developed.

Looking at the position more carefully, I see that my knight on c6 has some good options, particularly to e5 where it would be centralized and attacking the white bishop on c4. This seems like a strong developing move.

2. White has a bishop on c4 and a knight on h5
3. My king is on g8 with some pieces around for protection
4. I notice my bishop on e7 has several good options

Looking at the most promising moves:
- The knight on e5 is well-placed and could consider moves like Nc4 or Ng4
- The bishop on e7 could develop to better squares
- I should consider king safety and development

After evaluation, I think developing my bishop to f6 would be a strong move, protecting my king while increasing my piece activity.

Looking at the board:
- I'm playing Black and my king is on g8
- White has a knight on h5 that could be threatening
- I have a knight on e5 in a good central position
- My bishop on f6 is active
- I should consider development and king safety

Among my options:
- Knight moves from e5 could be active (e5g6, e5c6, e5g4, e5c4, e5f3, e5d3)
- King moves (g8f8, g8e8) might be needed for safety
- Pawn advances could improve my position

The knight on e5 is in a strong central position. Moving it to g4 looks particularly strong as it attacks White's pawn on h2 and potentially creates threats against White's kingside.

- I have a knight on g4 that's quite active
- White has a bishop on d4 that's centralized
- White's king is on c1, somewhat exposed

Looking at my options, I see several strong candidate moves:

1. Knight g4 has several interesting options (h2, f2, e3, e5)
2. Knight f6 can also move to several squares
3. I could castle by moving my king to f8 or e8

The knight on g4 is particularly active and could create threats. Moving it to h2 would fork White's king and rook. Let me make this move:

- I have a bishop on f6 that's actively placed
- I have a knight on h2 that seems to be on an outpost
- White has a knight on h5 that could be threatening

Looking at my options, I notice:
1. I could develop my queen-side with moves like b7b5
2. I could improve my knight on h2 with moves like h2f3 or h2g4
3. I could castle by moving my king to f8 or e8

The knight on h2 seems to be in a good attacking position. Moving it to f3 would put pressure on White's position and potentially fork pieces.

I'll make this move:

1. I'm playing as Black and have several pieces developed
2. My king is on g8 and appears to be uncastled
3. I have knights on f3 and f6, which are actively placed
4. White has a bishop on d4 and knights on b1 and f2

Looking at my options, I notice my knight on f3 has several strong moves available. It's already in an aggressive position and can make some interesting threats.

I'll play the knight move f3-d4, capturing White's bishop. This removes a strong piece from White's position and improves my control of the center.

I can see all my legal moves now. Let me analyze the position:

1. My knight on d4 is in a strong central position and has several good options.
2. I should consider developing my pieces and improving my position.

The knight on d4 has several attractive moves:
- Nd4-f5 would put pressure on White's position
- Nd4-e6 could be strong, controlling central squares
- Nd4-c6 would protect my queenside pawns

I think the best move is to play Nd4-f5, which puts the knight on an excellent outpost, controls important squares, and increases pressure on White's position.

I notice my knight on f6 has multiple moves, and I also have a bishop on f5 with good mobility. The position appears to be in the early middlegame with my king castled kingside.

Looking at the position strategically, I should focus on developing my remaining pieces and improving my position. One strong move would be to develop my rook on a8 to connect my rooks.

After analyzing the position, I can see I'm playing as Black and have several options. I notice my king is on g8, and I have a knight on f6 and a bishop on f5. White has a rook on b2 and a bishop on d3, with the white king on c1.

I'll consider a few strong candidate moves:
- Knight moves like Nf6-e4 could be strong, but I don't see that in the legal moves
- The bishop on f5 has several good options, including Bf5-e4 targeting the white king's position
- I could also develop my queenside with moves like b7-b5

Looking at the position strategically, I think the most active move is to place my bishop on e4, which puts pressure on White's position and controls important central squares.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

I apologize for the error. Let me check the legal moves again and make a valid move.

Looking at the list of legal moves provided, I see that "f5e4" is not actually in the list. Let me select a strong move from the available options.

The knight on f6 has several good options. Moving it to e4 would be strong, but that's not in the legal moves. I can consider Nf6-d4, which attacks the rook on b3 and puts pressure in the center.

For the bishop on f5, I could play Bf5-e4, but that's not listed as legal. Instead, I could consider Bf5-g3 which maintains the bishop's activity.

Based on the available moves, I'll play the knight to d4, which creates a strong threat against White's rook.

One of the strongest moves here is to develop my bishop on d4 to e3, which attacks White's king on c1 and creates a powerful threat. This forces White to respond to the check and gives me the initiative.

- White has a rook on b6 that's threatening my queenside
- I have a knight on f5 in a good outpost position
- My king is on g8 with some exposure

One of the strongest moves appears to be developing my dark-squared bishop on e3 to create more threats. The move e3f2 looks particularly strong as it attacks White's king position while maintaining pressure.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

After analyzing the position, I see several interesting options:

1. I have a bishop on f2 that's attacking the white king on c2, but it's not a check because the knight on d4 is blocking.
2. I have another bishop on f5 and a knight on f5 that could be developed.
3. My queen is active on d8 and could potentially move to create threats.

One of the strongest moves appears to be moving my bishop from f2 to e3, which would attack the white king and the knight on d4 simultaneously, creating a powerful fork.

Looking at my options, I should prioritize development and king safety. The knight on f5 has several good options, including a potential fork with Nd4 that would attack White's bishop on d3 and pawn on e2.

I'll make this move:

I'll analyze the position as Black:

The board shows I'm playing as Black with my king on g8. White has a rook on d4 that's attacking my d-pawn. I notice my knight on d4 is attacking several squares and has multiple options.

Looking at the legal moves, I see that my knight on d4 has many possibilities. This knight is currently undefended but is attacking White's bishop on d3. I should consider either capturing something valuable with the knight or moving it to a safer square with good control.

One of the strongest moves appears to be d4e6, which would fork White's king on c3 and rook on d8. This would create a powerful threat that White must respond to.

4. My queen on d8 has several possible moves

After evaluating the position, I think developing my knight to c5 would be a good move. This puts pressure on White's d3 square and the a4 pawn while developing my piece to a more active square.

3. I notice my king is on g8 with potential to castle or move

After evaluating the position, I see that my knight on c5 can fork White's king on c3 and rook on d4 by moving to e4. This would be a strong tactical move as it threatens both pieces simultaneously.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

After analyzing the position, I see that I'm playing as Black and have several options. I notice my knight on e4 is active and can make several moves. It's currently attacking White's bishop on d6, but also has other potential targets.

Looking at the position more carefully:
- My king is on g8
- I have a knight on e4 that's quite active in the center
- White has a bishop on d3 that could be targeted
- White's king is on b1, somewhat exposed

One of the strongest moves appears to be moving my knight to c3, which would fork White's king on b1 and rook on d4. This is a tactical opportunity that would win material.

Thank you for providing the legal moves. Let me analyze the position:

I notice I'm playing as Black and have a knight on c3 that's very active in White's territory. This knight has several good options, including forking pieces or checking the White king on c2.

Looking at the position, I see that my knight on c3 can move to e2, which would be a fork attacking both the White king on c2 and the rook on d4. This is a very strong tactical opportunity.

3. My king is on g8 with some pieces around it for protection
4. I notice my queen on d8 has several possible moves

Looking at my options, the knight on e2 is in a strong position and could potentially fork White's pieces. Let me check if there are any tactical opportunities with it.

The move e2c3 looks promising as it attacks White's b-pawn while maintaining a strong central position. This would put pressure on White's queenside.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

I'll analyze the position and make a strategic move as Black.

Looking at the board, I notice:
- My king is on g8 with a rook on h8
- White has a knight on g3 that could potentially threaten my queen
- My queen on e7 has many possible moves
- I should consider development and king safety

One strong move would be to castle kingside, which would connect my rooks and improve my king's safety. Since my king is already on g8, I need to move my rook to f8 to complete castling.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

I apologize for the error. It seems I misinterpreted the position. Let me look at the board again more carefully.

The king is already on g8 and there's a rook on h8, which means I've already castled kingside. Let me choose a better move from the legal moves list.

Looking at the position again, I should focus on improving my piece activity. One good option would be to develop my bishop from c8.

I apologize for the confusion. Let me check the legal moves list again and make a valid move.

From the legal moves list provided earlier, I see that I can move my queen to various squares or advance my pawns. Let me make a strategic decision.

Since White has a rook on d4 that could potentially become active, I'll play a move that helps control the center and prepares to challenge that rook.

2. White has a bishop on e5 threatening my queen
3. White has a knight on g3 and another on d1
4. Material appears roughly equal

I need to address the immediate threat to my queen. Moving the queen to a safe square while maintaining its activity is my priority.

The move e7d6 looks strong - it moves my queen to safety while maintaining control of important central squares and keeping pressure on White's position.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

I need to carefully analyze this position. I'm playing as Black and I see several key elements:

1. Material: I have a queen, two rooks, a bishop, and pawns. White has a rook, two knights, a bishop, and pawns.
2. King safety: My king is on g8 with some pawn protection.
3. Threats: White's bishop on e5 is attacking my queen on d6.
4. Opportunities: My queen is under attack but has many possible moves.

The most urgent issue is that my queen is under attack by the white bishop on e5. I need to either move the queen, capture the bishop, or block the attack.

Looking at my options, I can:
- Move my queen to a safer square
- Capture the bishop with my queen (d6e5)
- Block with a pawn (f7e6)

I don't see d6e5 in my legal moves, so capturing the bishop directly isn't an option. The best move appears to be to move my queen to a safe square while maintaining activity.

Among the queen moves, d6f4 looks strong as it maintains pressure on White's position and moves to a safe square.

One of the strongest moves I see is to attack White's king with my queen while developing with tempo:

1. My king is on g8 with a rook on h8 and f8
2. White has a bishop on e5 threatening my queen on d4
3. White has knights on f4 and d1
4. My queen on d4 is under attack but has many possible moves

The most pressing issue is my queen being attacked by White's bishop on e5. I should either move the queen to safety or capture the bishop.

Looking at the position, I notice that my queen on d4 can capture the knight on f4 with "d4f4", which would remove a dangerous piece and maintain my queen in an active position.

I see the position now. I'm playing as Black and have several options. Let me analyze the position:

1. I have a bishop on e6 and rooks on b8 and g8
2. My king is on g8
3. White's king is on d1
4. Material seems roughly equal with some pawns exchanged

Looking at my options, I notice my bishop on e6 has several good diagonal moves. The move e6c8 would put the bishop in the corner with limited scope. The move e6f5 looks active, controlling important central squares.

I also see I could centralize my king with moves like g8f8 or g8e8, which is often good in endgames.

After consideration, I'll play my bishop to f5, which increases its activity and controls important central squares.

I'm playing as Black and have several interesting options. I notice I have a bishop on f5 that's active, and my king is on g8 with rooks on b8 and g8. White's king is on d3, somewhat exposed.

Looking at the legal moves, I see tactical opportunities:
- My bishop on f5 can capture on c2 (f5c2), which would be a free pawn
- I could also consider king safety with moves like g8f8

The best move appears to be capturing the pawn on c2 with my bishop, which gains material while putting pressure on White's position.

I see the position now. As Black, I have a very limited choice - only two legal moves:

1. h8g7 (King from h8 to g7)
2. g8g7 (Rook from g8 to g7)

Looking at the position, I notice I'm playing with a material advantage (I have two rooks, a bishop, and several pawns while White has fewer pieces). My king is currently on h8, and I need to make a safe move.

The move h8g7 would move my king to g7, which appears to be safe as it's protected by my rook on g8. Moving the king to g7 also improves its position by bringing it more toward the center.

The alternative g8g7 would move my rook to g7, but this doesn't seem necessary at the moment and would block my king's best square.

I'll choose to move my king:

- I can move my king to various squares
- I can move my rooks along their respective ranks
- My bishop on g6 has several diagonal moves
- I have pawn moves available

The most active move appears to be connecting my rooks, which would improve my piece coordination and prepare for potential attacks along the back rank.

I'll analyze the position and my available moves:

I'm playing as Black and have a significant material advantage with two rooks, a bishop, and several pawns versus White's lone king. This is clearly a winning position for me.

Looking at my legal moves:
- I have rook moves (f8 to various squares)
- King moves (g7h8)
- Bishop moves (g6 to various diagonals)
- Several pawn moves

My priority should be to coordinate my pieces to deliver checkmate. I notice my king is on g7, and I have a rook on f8. I can improve my position by moving my rook to e8, which controls more of the board and maintains protection of my f7 pawn.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

After analyzing the position, I can see I'm playing as Black with a material advantage. I have my king on g7, rooks on e8 and g8, a bishop on g6, and several pawns. 

Looking at the legal moves, I notice I can improve my rook position. The e8 rook is already well placed on an open file, but the g8 rook could be better utilized.

I'll move my rook from g8 to f8, which:
1. Connects my rooks
2. Protects the f7 pawn
3. Maintains control of the 8th rank
4. Frees up the g-file for potential future use

Looking at the position, I notice:
1. My rooks are well-positioned on the 8th rank
2. White's king is exposed on d1
3. I have a bishop on g6 with good diagonals

One of the strongest moves here would be to connect my rooks, which would strengthen my position and prepare for an attack.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

I need to analyze the position carefully before making my move.

Looking at the board, I'm playing as Black and have a material advantage with two rooks, a bishop, and several pawns against White's king and bishop. My king is on g7, and I have rooks on e8 and g8.

I notice several strong options:
1. I could move my bishop (g6) to attack White's position
2. I could advance my pawns
3. I could reposition my rooks for a checkmate attack

Given White's exposed king on d1, I should aim to coordinate my pieces for a checkmate. The most direct approach would be to use my rooks effectively.

I'll move my rook from e8 to e1, creating a direct threat on the first rank that will force White's king to move or block, allowing me to make progress toward checkmate.

I'm playing as Black with my king on g7, a rook on e8, and a bishop on g6. I notice my bishop on g6 is attacking diagonally and could potentially capture something or create threats.

Looking at the board, I see White has a bishop on g5 that could be threatening my position. My rook on e8 is currently undefended but controls the e-file.

Among my options, I should consider:
1. Moving my rook to a more active position
2. Improving my bishop's position
3. Making a kingside move for safety

The move e8e4 looks particularly strong as it:
- Places my rook on the 4th rank where it can be more active
- Controls important central squares
- Could potentially threaten White's pieces or pawns

I'll make this move:

g7g8,g7f8,e4e5,f7f6

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

I need to analyze this position carefully as Black.

Current assessment:
- Material: I have a rook, bishop, and several pawns vs White's bishop and pawns
- My king is on g7, and I need to consider its safety
- My rook on e4 is active and could be useful
- I have a bishop on g7 that could be developed

Looking at my legal moves:
1. g7g8 - Promoting my bishop to a queen (seems like a typo in the legal moves, as g7 has my bishop not a pawn)
2. g7f8 - Moving my bishop from g7 to f8
3. e4e5 - Moving my rook forward
4. f7f6 - Moving my pawn forward

The most active and strong move appears to be e4e5, advancing my rook to a more central position, potentially threatening White's king on d3 and controlling more of the board.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

After analyzing the position and my available legal moves, I see several key factors:

1. I have a rook on e5 and a bishop on g6 that are both active pieces
2. My king is on g7 and appears relatively safe
3. I have a material advantage with a rook and bishop against White's lone king

Looking at the position, my rook on e5 is particularly powerful. I can use it to control the e-file and potentially deliver checkmate. The most decisive move appears to be to bring my rook to e1, pinning White's king against the back rank.

2. My bishop on g7 controls the long diagonal
3. My king on g6 is relatively safe

The most powerful move appears to be moving my rook to e8, creating a direct threat on the back rank. This puts immediate pressure on White and could lead to checkmate threats.

I'll analyze the position as Black:

I see I have a rook on e8, a bishop on g6, and my king on g7. White has a bishop on c7 and the white king is on d3. There's a white pawn on g5 that could be dangerous.

Looking at my options:
- I could move my rook along the e-file or the 8th rank
- I could move my bishop on g6 in various directions
- I could move my king or advance my pawns

The most pressing concern is the white pawn on g5, which is threatening to promote. I should consider capturing it with my bishop.

After evaluating the position, I'll capture the white pawn on g5 with my bishop, which removes the immediate threat and maintains control of the diagonal.

I apologize for the error. Let me check the board again. It seems I misread the position. Let me try again with a legal move.

- White has a bishop on c7 and a pawn on g5
- White's king is on d3

Let me check the legal moves again. I see that g6h5 is a legal move, which would capture the white pawn on g5.

One strong move would be to activate my rook by moving it to the e-file where it can put pressure on White's position:

I notice my rook on e1 is attacking the empty e-file, and I can deliver a check to the white king by moving it to b1. This would be a strong move as it forces the white king to move and gives me the initiative.

I need to analyze this position carefully. 

I see I'm playing as Black and have a bishop on f3, my king on g7, and pawns on a7, f7, h7, and c5. White has a king on b1, a bishop on b8, and pawns on c3 and g5.

Looking at my legal moves, I notice my bishop on f3 has many options. The most attractive one appears to be f3a8, which would capture White's bishop on b8 (the bishop would move diagonally through f3-e4-d5-c6-b7-a8). This would give me a material advantage.

I'll make this move:

I can see all my legal moves now. Let me analyze the position:

1. I'm playing as Black and have a bishop on a8, king on g7, and pawns on a7, f7, h7, and c4.
2. White has a king on b2, bishop on h2, and pawns on c3 and g4.
3. The position is relatively simplified with few pieces left.

Looking at my options:
- My bishop on a8 has several diagonal moves available
- I can move my king or any of my pawns

The most strategic move appears to be to activate my bishop by moving it to the long diagonal where it can exert more influence. Moving to f3 would place it on an excellent diagonal controlling important squares.

Looking at the legal moves, I notice my bishop on f3 has many options. It's currently on a strong diagonal and can potentially create threats. The h5 move looks particularly interesting as it puts pressure on White's position.

I'll make a move with my bishop to h5, which maintains control of important diagonals while creating new threats.

Let me check what legal moves I have available.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Now I can see my legal moves. Let me analyze the position:

This is an endgame with bishops of opposite colors (my bishop on h4 vs White's bishop on b8). I need to make a strong move that improves my position.

Looking at the available moves, I notice:
- I can move my king (g7 to h8/g8/f8/g6)
- I can move my bishop (h4 to g6/g4/f3/e2/d1)
- I can advance my pawns (h7-h6, f7-f6/f5, a7-a6/a5)

The bishop on h4 is currently attacking White's pawn on c3, which is good. I should consider advancing my pawns to create passed pawns.

I'll advance my a-pawn two squares, which creates a potential passed pawn and gives me more space on the queenside.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

I need to analyze this position carefully. 

I see that I'm playing as Black with my king on g7, a bishop on h5, and pawns on a5, c4, f7, and h7. White has a king on b2, a bishop on b8, and pawns on c3, g5, and f7.

Looking at my legal moves:
- My bishop on h5 has several diagonal moves available
- My king can move to several squares
- I can advance my pawns

The most critical aspect is my king's safety and potential threats. The white bishop on b8 is currently not directly threatening anything important. I should look for active moves that improve my position.

My bishop on h5 is well-placed on the long diagonal and could potentially be useful for attacking. Moving it to g4 would maintain control of important squares while potentially preparing to move to f3 later to put pressure on White's position.

I'll make this move:

This appears to be an endgame position where I need to be careful with my king's safety while potentially using my bishop effectively.

The bishop on g4 has many diagonal moves available, and I should consider if there's a tactical opportunity. Looking at the position, I notice my bishop on g4 can move to e2, which would create a fork between White's king on b2 and potentially another piece or important square.

I see the current position and my legal moves. Let me analyze the situation:

I'm playing as Black with my king on g7. I have pawns on a4, c4, f7, and h7. I also have a bishop on g4. White has a king on b2, a bishop on e5, and pawns on c3 and g6.

My legal moves are:
- g7g8 (King moves up)
- g7f8 (King moves diagonally up-left)
- g7h6 (King moves diagonally down-right)
- g7g6 (King moves down)
- f7f6 (Pawn moves forward)

Looking at these options:
- Moving my king to g8 or f8 seems passive
- Moving my king to h6 would approach the white pawn on g6
- Moving my king to g6 would capture the white pawn
- Moving my pawn to f6 would advance a pawn

The best move appears to be capturing the white pawn with my king, as it removes one of White's pieces without putting my king in danger.

- 'get_legal_moves' to get a UCI formatted list of available moves
- 'make_move <UCI formatted move>' when you are ready to complete your turn (e.g., 'make_move e2e4')

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

I need to analyze this position carefully. I'm playing as Black with my king on g6 and a bishop on g4. White has a king on b2 and a bishop on f6.

Key observations:
- My king on g6 is in check from White's bishop on f6
- I need to address this check immediately
- My bishop on g4 is undefended but attacking along the diagonal
- I have pawns on a5, c4, f7, and h7

Since I'm in check, I must either move my king, capture the checking piece, or block the check. Looking at my legal moves, I have:

1. Move king: g6h6, g6f6, g6h5, or g6f5
2. Capture the checking piece: Not possible directly

The safest move appears to be g6h6, moving my king to h6 which gets out of check and maintains a relatively safe position.

- I should look for the strongest move

After analyzing the position, I see that my bishop on g4 can capture White's bishop on d1, which would be a material gain.

Key considerations:
1. My king is on h6 and needs to stay safe
2. My bishop on d1 has several possible moves
3. I have pawn moves available

The most active piece I have is my bishop on d1, which has good diagonal control. Moving it to h5 would put pressure on the position while maintaining control of important diagonals.

The most important factors to consider:
1. King safety
2. Piece activity
3. Pawn structure

My king on h6 is somewhat exposed, and I should consider improving its position. Moving the king to g6 would be more central and safer.

I'll make this move:

Let me analyze this position:

I'm playing as Black with my king on g6 and I have a bishop on h5 and pawns on f7 and h7. White has a king on b2, a bishop on b4, and a pawn on c3.

My bishop on h5 is currently attacking along the a2-g8 diagonal and has several possible moves. My king has multiple options as well.

Looking at the position, I notice:
- My bishop is very active and controls important squares
- There's no immediate threat from White
- I should consider improving my position

The best move appears to be to improve my bishop's position by moving it to f3, where it controls more of the board and puts pressure on White's position.

I see that I'm playing as Black with my king on g6, a bishop on f3, and pawns on f7, h7, and c5. White has a king on b2, a bishop on f6, and pawns on c3 and f6.

Looking at my legal moves, I notice that my bishop on f3 has many options. The most attractive one seems to be f3a8, which would place my bishop on the long diagonal where it controls important squares and can't be immediately challenged.

However, I also need to consider my king's safety. With White's bishop on f6 putting pressure on my position, I should address this threat. Moving my king to f5 would be risky as it could walk into checks.

The move f7f6 would capture White's bishop, eliminating a threat and improving my pawn structure. This seems like the strongest move in the position.

The move e2h5 looks particularly strong as it puts my bishop on a good diagonal while maintaining control of important squares. This move threatens White's position while keeping my pieces coordinated.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

I see the current position and my legal moves. Let me analyze the situation:

1. I'm playing as Black with a king on g6, a bishop on h5, and pawns on f6, c4, and h7.
2. White has a king on b2, a bishop on b4, and a pawn on c3.

Looking at my options:
- My bishop on h5 is powerful on the a2-g8 diagonal and can move to g4, f3, e2, or d1
- My king has several moves (g7, f7, h6, g5, f5)
- I can advance my pawns (h7-h6 or f6-f5)

The best move appears to be to use my bishop to attack White's position. Moving the bishop to f3 creates a strong diagonal threat and puts pressure on White.

2. White has a king on c2, a bishop on b4, and a pawn on c3
3. I have a bishop on f3 which has many available moves

Looking at the position, I notice my bishop on f3 is very active and controls important diagonals. I should consider how to best use this piece. The white king is exposed on c2, and my bishop is already targeting that area.

One strong move would be to move my bishop to e4, creating a powerful diagonal control and putting pressure on White's position. This move maintains my bishop's activity while targeting the c2 square where the white king is located.

- White has a bishop on c3, a king on d1, and pawns on c3 and c5

Looking at my options, I notice:
1. My bishop on b7 has many diagonal moves available
2. I can move my king in several directions
3. I can advance my pawns

The most strategic move appears to be to improve my bishop's position. Moving it to the long diagonal with b7f3 would put pressure on White's position and control more of the board.

Now I can see all my legal moves. Let me analyze the position and make a strategic decision:

1. Development is key in the opening, and I have several good developing moves available.
2. Knight to c6 (b8c6) is a natural developing move that controls the center.
3. Bishop development with Bf8-e7 (f8e7) is also solid.
4. I could consider d7-d6 to support my e5 pawn.

The most principled move here is to develop my knight to c6, which follows opening principles by:
- Developing a piece
- Controlling central squares
- Preparing for castling

I can see the current board position. White has developed their light-squared bishop to c4, attacking my f7 pawn, and has also played a3. I've developed both knights to c6 and f6, and pushed my e-pawn to e5.

Let me check what legal moves I have available.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

After analyzing the position, I need to address White's bishop on c4 which is targeting my f7 pawn. I should also continue my development.

One of the best moves here is to develop my light-squared bishop to e7, which protects the f7 pawn and continues my development naturally.

I can see the current position and my legal moves. I notice that:

1. I have the option to castle kingside (e8g8), which is often a good move for king safety
2. White has a bishop on c4 targeting my kingside
3. My knights are developed at c6 and f6
4. My dark-squared bishop is on e7 and light-squared bishop on c8

Castling kingside would be a strong move here as it brings my king to safety and connects my rooks. This is typically a priority in the opening/early middlegame.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

After analyzing the position, I can see I'm playing as Black in what appears to be a position from the opening phase. White has played e4, and I have knights on c6 and f6, bishops on e7 and c8, and my king is castled kingside.

Looking at my legal moves, I notice I can continue development. Since I've already castled kingside, I should focus on connecting my rooks and developing my queenside.

I'll play the natural developing move:

make_move a8b8

This move develops my queenside rook to a semi-open b-file and connects my rooks, improving my position. It's a standard developing move in many openings after kingside castling.

2. My king is on g8 with a rook on f8
3. I have knights on c6 and f6, bishops on e7 and b8, and a queen on d8
4. White has advanced a pawn to e5, controlling central squares

Looking at my options, I should prioritize development and king safety. The knight on f6 is under pressure from the e5 pawn, and I should consider either moving it or supporting it.

One strong move would be to develop my light-squared bishop with:

make_move e7c5

This develops my bishop to an active diagonal, puts pressure on White's center, and maintains flexibility in my position. The bishop on c5 will target White's kingside and control important central squares.

Looking at the board, I notice:
- Both sides have castled kingside
- White has a queen on e5, which is quite active
- I have two bishops and two knights developed
- My bishop on c5 is attacking White's queen indirectly

Among my options, I see several strong candidate moves:

1. `c5e3` - Moving my bishop to attack White's queen and potentially win material
2. `f6e4` - Developing my knight to a central square with pressure
3. `c6d4` - Knight to a central square attacking White's queen

The move `c5e3` looks particularly strong as it directly attacks White's queen. If White moves the queen, I can potentially capture the pawn on e5.

2. Places my knight on a strong central square
3. Creates immediate tactical pressure

2. I notice my knight on e4 is attacking White's queen on d2
3. I also have a knight on c6 that could develop into more active positions
4. My queen on d8 has several possible moves

The most striking opportunity is my knight on e4 which can fork White's queen and other pieces. Let me check the specific options:

- e4f2: Knight attacks White's king and queen simultaneously - this is a royal fork!
- e4d2: Knight captures White's queen directly

The royal fork with e4f2 is extremely powerful as it threatens both the king and queen. White would be forced to move the king, allowing me to capture the queen next move.

I need to analyze this position carefully. 

I notice that:
- I'm playing as Black and have a knight on f2 that's deep in White's territory
- White has a bishop on b4 and a queen on d4
- The position looks somewhat tactical

Among my options, the knight on f2 is in a strong position and can make several interesting moves. The move f2d1 looks particularly strong as it would fork White's king on e1 and rook on a1.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

After analyzing the position and my available legal moves, I notice several important factors:

1. White has a queen on d4 and a bishop on b4, creating pressure on my position
2. My knight on c6 is under attack by the bishop on b4
3. I need to address these threats while developing my pieces

One of the strongest moves here is to develop my queen with a threat:

make_move d8h4

This move accomplishes several things:
- Develops my queen to an active position
- Creates a threat against White's kingside
- Puts pressure on the f2 square
- Prepares for potential kingside attack

The queen on h4 will be well-positioned for attacking possibilities while I continue developing my other pieces.

2. My queen is on h4, potentially threatening White's king
3. I have a knight on c6 that could be developed

Looking at the legal moves, I notice my queen has several attacking options. Let me check if there's a strong tactical move available.

The move h4e1 looks very promising - this would be my queen moving to e1, which appears to be a checkmate since the White king is on f1 with no escape squares and no pieces that can block or capture my queen.

The strongest move appears to be capturing the queen with my e-pawn:

2. White has a bishop on b4 that's attacking my c-pawn
3. I have a knight on c6 with several possible moves
4. My king is on g8 with castling no longer available

Looking at my options, the knight on d1 is in an excellent outpost and can make several strong moves. I can either retreat it to safety or use it to attack.

The move d1e3 looks particularly strong as it:
- Attacks White's c2 pawn
- Controls important central squares
- Develops the knight to a more active position

I'll make this move:

Looking at the board, I notice:
- I have two knights - one on c6 and one on e3
- White has a bishop on b5 that's putting pressure on my position
- My king is on g8 with a rook on f8
- The pawn structure is relatively intact

Among my options, I see several strong candidate moves:

1. Knight moves like e3f5 or e3c4 could develop pressure
2. I could castle with g8h8
3. I could challenge White's bishop with a6 or b6
4. I could advance central pawns with d5

The knight on e3 is well-placed and active, so I'll use it to create threats. Moving it to c4 puts pressure on White's d2 square and the pawn on b2, while maintaining a central presence.

I'll analyze the position as Black:

The position appears to be in the middle game with both kings castled. I notice my knight on c4 is active and could potentially fork White's pieces. I also have a knight on c6 that could be developed to better squares.

Looking at the legal moves, I see several strong options:
- The knight on c4 has multiple attacking possibilities
- I could advance my d-pawn to challenge White's center
- I could improve my knight on c6

After evaluating the position, I believe the best move is to play the knight from c4 to e3, which attacks White's light-squared bishop and potentially creates tactical threats.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

I can see all my legal moves now. Let me analyze the position:

1. I'm playing as Black and the position appears to be in the middle game
2. White has a bishop on b4 that's attacking my queenside
3. My knight on c6 is developed and has several potential moves
4. I have a pawn on d4 that's advanced and could be vulnerable
5. My king is castled on the kingside

Looking at the key options:
- I could defend against the bishop with moves like b7b6 or a7a6
- I could develop further with moves like f8e8 or f8d8
- I could advance my d-pawn with d4d3
- I could make a knight move to improve its position

The d4 pawn seems to be a key piece in this position. It's advanced but potentially vulnerable. Since it's supported by my pieces and is putting pressure on White's position, I'll protect and advance it further with:

2. I have a pawn on d3 that has advanced deep into White's territory and can move to d2
3. My king is on g8 with castled position
4. White has a bishop on c3 that's attacking diagonally

The pawn on d3 is quite advanced and threatening to promote. Moving it to d2 would increase that threat significantly and force White to deal with it.

2. White has a bishop on d4 that's somewhat exposed
3. My king is on g8 with a rook on f8
4. I have a knight on c6 that could be developed

Looking at my options, I see several strong possibilities:

1. I could play `c1e3` attacking White's e-pawn while developing my queen
2. I could play `c6d4` capturing White's bishop with my knight
3. I could play `c1d1` with my queen, putting pressure on the d-file

Among these, capturing the bishop with `c6d4` seems most straightforward - it wins material without obvious drawbacks.

Given the immediate threat to my queen, I should address this first. I'll move my queen to e3, which:
- Gets out of the bishop's attack
- Creates a counter-threat against White's king on e5
- Maintains good queen mobility in the center

- White's king is on e3, quite active
- The position appears to be in the middlegame with an open center

Looking at my options, I should prioritize king safety and piece development. Since I have my king on g8 and rook on f8, completing my kingside castle with the king move to h8 would be a solid choice. This keeps my king safe and connects my rooks.

Looking at the board:
- White has a bishop on d4 and the king on e3
- As Black, I have my king on g8 with rooks on b8 and f8
- The pawn structure is relatively intact, but I should consider development

I notice my king is on g8 and I have a rook on f8. One good option would be to castle kingside by moving the rook to g8 (which is the "O-O" castling move in standard notation, represented as "f8g8" in UCI format). This would improve my king's safety and connect my rooks.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Looking at the position and my legal moves, I notice that White's bishop on f6 is a significant threat. It's attacking my g7 pawn and restricting my king's movement.

My priority should be to address this bishop. I could either capture it with a pawn (g7xf6) but that doesn't appear to be a legal move, suggesting the bishop is protected. Another approach would be to block the bishop's attack by moving my king to f8.

Since the bishop is threatening my g7 pawn and limiting my king's mobility, I'll move my king to f8, which gets out of the diagonal attack and protects the g7 pawn.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

After analyzing the position, I see that I'm playing as Black with my king on g8 and rooks on b8 and f8. I notice that my f8 rook has many options, and I also have various pawn moves available.

Looking at the position, I see that White has a bishop on c4 targeting my kingside, and White's king is on e3. My kingside is somewhat exposed with no pawn on f7, so I should consider improving my king's safety.

One of the strongest moves here would be to castle kingside, which would connect my rooks and improve my king's safety. The move f8g8 represents this castling move.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

I'll analyze the position and my available moves:

The position shows I'm playing as Black with my king on g8. White has a bishop on c4 and the white king is on e3. I need to consider both safety and development.

Key observations:
- My king is on g8 with rooks on b8 and h8
- I have pawns on a7, b7, c7, d7, g7, and h7
- White has a bishop on c4 that's controlling the a2-g8 diagonal

Looking at my options:
1. King moves (g8f8, g8e8, g8d8) - not urgent as I'm not in check
2. Rook moves (b8a8) - not particularly useful
3. Pawn advances - these could help develop my position

Among the pawn moves, I should prioritize central control and development. The move d7-d5 stands out as it:
- Controls central squares
- Challenges White's bishop on c4
- Opens lines for my bishop on c8
- Creates space for development

I'll make this move:

4. I have several options including king moves, bishop moves, and pawn moves

Looking at the position, I notice my d5 pawn is hanging and needs attention. I could capture White's e4 pawn with d5xe4, which would eliminate the threat to my pawn and gain material.

I'll make this move:

4. I should consider both attacking opportunities and defensive needs

Looking at my options, I see that pushing my e-pawn with e4e3 would increase pressure on White's king and gain space. This move would maintain the pressure while potentially setting up future threats.

I notice my e-pawn has advanced to e3, creating a passed pawn threat. This is a strong asset I should consider. My bishop on c8 is undeveloped, and I have several options to develop it.

Looking at the legal moves, I think developing my bishop to f5 would be a good choice. This:
1. Develops a piece
2. Controls important central squares
3. Puts pressure on White's position
4. Protects my advanced e-pawn indirectly

Looking at the board, I notice:
- I'm playing as Black with my king on g8
- White has a bishop on c3 and king on f4
- I have a bishop on g4 that's currently attacking White's position
- The pawn structure shows I have some options for development

Among my legal moves, I see several strong possibilities:

1. The bishop on g4 has multiple good options, including g4f5 which would put pressure on White's king
2. I could also consider king safety with moves like g8f8

After evaluating the position, I believe the strongest move is to put pressure on White's king with my bishop.

You are a professional chess player and you play as black. Now is your turn to make a move. Before making a move you can pick one of the following actions:
- 'get_current_board' to get the schema and current status of the board
- 'get_legal_moves' to get a UCI formatted list of available moves
- 'make_move <UCI formatted move>' when you are ready to complete your turn (e.g., 'make_move e2e4')

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

I need to analyze this position carefully. I'm playing as Black and I see several interesting features:

1. Material is roughly equal
2. My bishop on f5 is active and attacking White's king on f4
3. I have potential threats along the back rank with my rooks

Looking at my legal moves, I notice that my bishop on f5 has many options. The most aggressive would be to check the White king with Bf5-g4+, but I should consider if this is the best use of my bishop.

I also see that I can connect my rooks with Kg8-f8, which is often a good strategic move.

After careful consideration, I believe the strongest move is to put the White king in check while maintaining control of important diagonals:

Key observations:
- I have a bishop on g4 that's actively placed
- My king is on g8 with rooks on b8 and h8
- White's king is on f4, somewhat exposed
- I have a pawn on e3 that's advanced and threatening

Looking at my legal moves, I see some strong options:

1. The bishop on g4 has many potential moves, including the diagonal to e2 which would attack White's pawn
2. I could move my e3 pawn forward to e2, creating a dangerous passed pawn
3. I have various king and rook moves available

The most forcing and advantageous move appears to be advancing my e-pawn:

After analyzing the position and available moves, I can see I'm playing as Black with a queen on e1, a bishop on g4, and my king on g8. White has a king on f4, knights on f3 and d4, and a bishop on f5.

I notice my queen on e1 has many powerful options. One particularly strong move is to check the white king with:

make_move e1h4

This move:
1. Puts the white king in check
2. Attacks the white king from a safe distance
3. The queen can't be captured immediately
4. Creates a powerful pin against the white king

This forces White to respond to the check, giving me the initiative and potentially setting up further tactical opportunities.

Looking at the position strategically, I see a strong move:

make_move e6e5

This move:
1. Attacks White's knight on e5 directly
2. Maintains the pin on White's knight at d4
3. Controls more central squares
4. Keeps my queen active and flexible

This creates immediate pressure and forces White to respond to the threat on their knight.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

I need to analyze this position carefully. I'm playing as Black, and I see several key elements:

1. Material is roughly even
2. My king is on g8 with a rook on each side
3. White has a rook on a4 and f1, a bishop on f5, and a knight on d2
4. White's king is on g6, somewhat exposed

Looking at my legal moves, I need to consider safety and counterplay. White's rook on a4 is threatening my a-pawn, and the bishop on f5 controls important diagonals.

I'll play a solid king move to improve my king's safety and maintain control of my position.

4. White has a knight on d4 and rooks on a1 and f1

The most pressing concern is that White's king is quite advanced on g6, which could be threatening. I should consider either defending against potential threats or creating counterplay.

Looking at my options, I notice I can strengthen my king's position by moving my rook from f8 to g8, which would provide additional protection.

Looking at my legal moves, I need to consider safety and development. I notice my king is somewhat exposed with White's bishop on f4 potentially creating threats.

One good move would be to connect my rooks by moving my king to f8, which improves my king safety and prepares for potential counterplay.

- My king is on g8 with rooks on b8 and h8
- The pawn structure shows I have pawns on a7, b7, c7, g7, and h7
- White has a pawn on b7 which is quite advanced

The most pressing issue is that White's bishop on f5 is attacking my g7 pawn, which is part of my king's protection. I should address this threat.

Among my options:
- I could move my king (g8f8, g8e8, etc.)
- I could move either rook
- I could advance various pawns

The most natural move is to defend the g7 pawn by moving my king to f8, which also increases my king's activity.

I see that I'm playing as Black, and I have my king on g8 with rooks on b8 and f8. White has a rook on a4 that's attacking my a7 pawn, and there's a white bishop on f6 that's controlling some important squares.

Looking at the legal moves, I notice I can move either of my rooks or make pawn moves. The a7 pawn is under attack, so I should consider defending it. I also need to improve my king's safety.

One strong move would be to centralize my rook with f8d8, which activates the rook and prepares to control the d-file. This gives me more active play while maintaining a solid position.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

I need to analyze the position carefully before making my move.

Looking at the board, I see that:
- I'm playing as Black with my king on h8
- White has a king on h6 and material advantage
- I have rooks on b8 and d8, and pawns on a7, b7, c7, g7, and h7
- White has a dangerous bishop on f5 controlling the h7 pawn

The most pressing issue is that my king on h8 is somewhat exposed. I should consider either defending it better or creating counterplay.

Among my options:
- Moving the king to g8 would be safer
- Moving the d8 rook could develop it to a more active position
- Advancing pawns could create some counterplay

I'll move my king to g8 to improve its safety and avoid any potential threats along the h-file.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

I need to analyze this position carefully. 

I see that I'm playing as Black and I have a king on g8 with rooks on b8 and d8. White has a bishop on c8 which is attacking my rook on d8. I also notice White has a rook on a6 that could be threatening my queenside.

Looking at my legal moves, I need to address the immediate threat to my rook on d8. I could move the rook away or capture the bishop with the rook.

Capturing the bishop with Rxc8 seems like the best move here, as it eliminates the threat and gains material (a bishop for free).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

I need to analyze this position carefully as Black.

Looking at the board:
- White has a rook on a6, another on b1, a knight on d2, and the king on h6
- Black has two rooks (b8 and c8), pawns on a7, b7, c7, g7, h7, and the king on g8

The most pressing concern is my king safety. I have my king on g8 with rooks nearby for defense. White's pieces aren't in an immediate attacking position against my king.

Among my options:
- I could develop my rooks to better squares
- I could advance my pawns to gain space
- I could improve my king position

The move c8f8 looks particularly strong as it centralizes one of my rooks while maintaining connection with my other rook. This gives me better control of the board and prepares for potential counterplay.

- White has a rook on a7 that's attacking my b7 pawn
- White has another rook on b1
- White's king is on h6
- Material is roughly even

Looking at my options, I need to consider both defensive and attacking possibilities. The a7 rook is threatening my b7 pawn, so I should address that. I could also look for counterattack opportunities.

One strong move would be to centralize my rook with `f8e8`, which increases my control of the board and prepares for potential attacks down the e-file.

Another good option is `b8a8`, directly challenging White's rook on a7.

After careful consideration, I'll challenge the rook on a7:

Player_Black (to Proxy):

I can see the current position and my legal moves. As Black, I'm in what appears to be an endgame position where:

1. I have my king on g8 with rooks on a8 and h8
2. I have pawns on c7, g7, and h7
3. White has material advantage with two rooks, a knight, and several pawns

Looking at the position, I notice that:
- My king is on the back rank
- I should consider creating some space for my king to avoid potential back-rank mates
- I should also consider activating my rooks

Among my legal moves, creating some luft (breathing space) for my king with h7-h6 seems prudent, as it prevents any potential back-rank checkmate threats.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Now I understand the position better. I'm playing as Black with my king on g8, rooks on a8 and g7, and pawns on c7, g7, and h6. White has a bishop on b8 which is attacking my king's position.

Looking at my options, I need to address the check from the white bishop on b8. I have several ways to do this:
1. Block with the rook: a8b8
2. Move the king: g8f8, g8h7
3. Capture the bishop: a8b8

The best move here is to capture the bishop with my rook, which eliminates the threat and gains material.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

I need to analyze this position carefully as Black.

Looking at the board:
- I'm playing as Black with my king on g8
- White has a rook on e1 and a1, a knight on d2, and a king on h5
- I have rooks on b8 and g8, and pawns on c7, g7, and h6
- White's a7 rook is threatening my b8 rook

Key considerations:
1. My king's safety is paramount
2. The a7 rook is an immediate threat to my b8 rook
3. I should look for counterplay or defensive moves

Among my options:
- Moving my king (g8f8, etc.) doesn't address immediate threats
- Moving my b8 rook away from the a7 threat makes sense
- Advancing pawns like c7c5 could create counterplay

The best move appears to be to move my b8 rook to safety while maintaining activity. Moving it to b4 gives it good scope and avoids the threat.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Looking at the position, I need to make a strategic decision as Black. 

I notice that:
- I have two rooks (one on g8 and one on b4)
- White has a rook on a7 threatening my c7 pawn
- White has another rook on e5
- My king is on g8

The most pressing issue is the threat to my c7 pawn. I could defend it with my rook from b4, but I can also consider more active options.

Looking at my rook on b4, it's currently on an open b-file and could potentially create threats. Moving it to b8 would connect my rooks, which is generally good positionally.

Another strong option is to use my rook on b4 to attack on the 4th rank, particularly targeting the d4 pawn.

After analyzing the position, I'll make my move:

My king is relatively safe, but I need to be careful about potential checks. Looking at my options, I notice my rook on d4 is very active and can potentially create threats.

The most powerful move appears to be:

make_move d4d8

This move keeps my rook active while defending the back rank. It maintains control of the d-file and protects against any potential back-rank threats. From d8, the rook continues to have good mobility and defensive capabilities while maintaining pressure on White's position.

Looking at the position, I notice:
1. My king is relatively safe at the moment
2. I have control of the d-file with my rook
3. White's king is somewhat exposed on h4

Among my legal moves, I should consider:
- Rook moves that increase my control of the board
- Pawn advances that might create threats
- King safety

The move d8d2 stands out as it would capture White's knight, which appears to be undefended. This would be a material gain and a strong move.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

I need to analyze this position carefully. 

I see that I'm playing as Black and have my king on g8 with rooks on g8 and h2. White has a king on g3 and rooks on a7 and c4, with a pawn on g4.

The most critical aspects of this position:
1. My rook on h2 is very active on the second rank
2. My king is safe for now
3. I have pawns on c7, g7, and h6

Looking at my legal moves, I should consider:
- Using my h2 rook to attack or control key squares
- Advancing my pawns to create threats or future passed pawns

The strongest move appears to be using my rook on h2 to attack White's king position. I can play h2g2+, which checks the White king and forces it to move.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

I need to analyze this position carefully. 

I see that I'm playing as Black and have my king on g8 with rooks on g2 and g7. White has a king on h6 and rooks on a7 and c4, with a pawn on g5.

Key observations:
- My rook on g2 is attacking the 2nd rank and could potentially deliver a check
- I have pawns on c7, g7, and h6 that need protection
- White's rook on c4 is controlling the c-file

Looking at the legal moves, I should prioritize safety and activity. The rook on g2 is already well-placed, attacking along the 2nd rank. Moving my king to safety while maintaining control seems prudent.

I'll make the move:

make_move g8f8

This improves my king's safety by moving it away from the edge of the board while maintaining my position. It keeps my rook on g2 active and preserves my pawn structure.

- White has rooks on b7 and c4, and a king on h5
- Material is roughly equal, but I need to consider the tactical situation

Looking at the legal moves, I see a powerful option: I can play Rg2-g1+, which gives check to the White king. This would force the White king to move, allowing me to gain tempo and potentially set up a mating attack.

Let me check what legal moves I have available.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

After analyzing the position and my legal moves, I need to make a strong decision as Black.

I notice that my rook on g1 is attacking the 1st rank while White's king is on h6 and White's rooks are on b7 and c7. This gives me an opportunity for a back-rank checkmate.

I'll play:

make_move g1a1

This move places my rook on the a-file, controlling the entire first rank. This threatens checkmate if White doesn't respond appropriately. Since White's king is far away on h6 and both White rooks are on the 7th rank, they cannot immediately defend against this threat. This gives me a strong attacking position and potentially winning advantage.

Looking at the legal moves, I notice White's rook on b4 is attacking my position. I should consider either defending against threats or creating counterplay.

One strong move would be to use my rook to attack the 7th rank, which could create threats against White's king. Moving my f8 rook to f2 would put pressure on White's position and potentially threaten the g2 square (though there's no pawn there currently).

After analyzing the position and my legal moves, I can see that I have two rooks (on a8 and f2) and two pawns (on h6 and h3), while White has two rooks (on b4 and h1) and two pawns (on g4 and h5).

I notice that my rook on f2 is attacking along the second rank and could potentially capture White's pawns or check the White king. My king on g8 seems relatively safe at the moment.

I'll make a strong move with my rook on f2, bringing it to the first rank to put pressure on White's king:

The most pressing threat is White's rook on h1, which is attacking my back rank. I need to either defend against a potential mate or create counterplay.

One of the strongest moves here is to use my rook on f1 to check White's king:

After analyzing the position, I can see this is a critical endgame position. I have two rooks (on a8 and g1) against White's two rooks (on b4 and h1), plus pawns on both sides.

My king is on h8, and I need to be careful about potential checks or mate threats. White's king is on g7, which is quite active.

Looking at my options, I notice I can use my rook on g1 to control the first rank and potentially threaten White's rook on h1. This would be a strong move as it prevents White's rook from becoming active.

I'll make a move with my rook on a8 to control more of the board and prepare for a potential checkmate.

I have two rooks (on e8 and e1) and my king on h8, while White has a rook on c4 and king on h1. There are some pawns on the h-file and g-file.

Looking at the position, I notice I have a very strong attack with my two rooks controlling the e-file. This gives me an opportunity for a checkmate.

The best move here is to use my rook on e1 to deliver checkmate:

White has:
- King on h1
- Rook on c3
- Pawns on g4 and g3

I see the current position and my legal moves. Let me analyze the situation:

I'm playing as Black and have my king on g8, a rook on e8, and pawns on h6 and g4. White has a rook on c4 and pawns on g3 and h1 (the h1 appears to be a king, though its position is unusual).

Looking at my options, I notice my rook on e8 is undefended and could be captured by White's rook on c4 if it moves to e4. I should either move my rook to a safer position or defend it.

Since my king is on g8, I could consider connecting my rooks by moving the e8 rook to e1, creating a potential back-rank threat. Alternatively, I could use my rook to control the e-file or move it to attack White's position.

I'll make a strong move by maintaining control of the e-file while also preparing for potential attacks:

The best move here is to move my rook to h1, delivering a checkmate since the White king on g1 would have nowhere to go.

- I'm playing as Black with a king on h8 and rooks on h1 and h6
- White has a king on g5 and a rook on c4
- There are pawns on g4, g7, and h6

Looking at the position critically:
1. My king is confined to the h8-g8-g7 area
2. My rook on h1 is active and can move along the h-file or the 1st rank
3. I have a pawn on h6 that can advance

The most important move here is to keep my rook active while maintaining king safety. Moving my rook to the 5th rank would create a threat while keeping an eye on my king's defense.

1. I'm playing as Black with my king on h8 and rook on h4
2. White has a king on g6 and a rook on e4
3. There's a white pawn on g7 and a black pawn on h5

This is a critical position. My king is confined to the h8-g8-g7-h7 area, and White's pawn on g7 is threatening to promote. My rook on h4 is active but needs to be used effectively.

The most pressing issue is White's pawn on g7, which threatens to promote. I need to either capture it or prepare a defense against its promotion.

Looking at my options:
- Moving my king doesn't solve the immediate threat
- My rook can move along the h-file but doesn't directly address the pawn threat

The best move is to bring my king to g8 to control the g7 square and prevent the pawn from promoting.

I have these options:
- Move my king (g8h8, g8h7, g8g7)
- Advance my h-pawn (h5h4, h5h3, h5h2, h5h1)

The h-pawn is quite advanced and could be a decisive factor. However, moving it to h4 would allow White's rook to capture it. Moving it further down the board would be risky with White's rook on f4 able to potentially stop it.

My king should stay close to my pawn for protection. Moving to g7 would directly protect my pawn, which seems like the most principled approach in this endgame position.

This appears to be an endgame position where I need to be careful. My priority should be king safety and potentially using my rook effectively.

Looking at the position, I notice that my rook on h4 is currently undefended and potentially under threat. Moving it to h1 would be safer and could potentially set up a back-rank check later.

I can see the board now. This appears to be an endgame position where:
- I'm playing as Black with my king on g7 and rook on h4
- White has a king on g3 and rook on d4
- There are pawns on g4 (White's) and h6, h7 (Black's)

Let me check what legal moves I have available.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Now I can see my legal moves. Let me analyze the position:

This is a critical endgame position. I notice that my rook on h4 can capture White's g4 pawn with Rxg4+. This would give me a check and eliminate White's passed pawn, which is a significant threat.

After capturing the pawn, I would have a material advantage with two connected passed pawns on the h-file. These pawns would be very strong and could potentially decide the game in my favor.

I'll make this move:

Let me check what legal moves I have available.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Now I understand my available moves. Looking at the position:

I have my king on g7 with several possible moves, and a pawn on h7 that can advance to h5. I also have a pawn on g6.

White has a rook on d4 and king on g4. This is a critical position where I need to make a good move.

The most important considerations:
1. Safety of my king
2. Advancing my pawns if possible
3. Avoiding any potential checkmate threats

Looking at my options, advancing my h-pawn with h7-h5 seems strong as it creates a passed pawn that could promote. My king can also support this pawn's advance.

I see that the pawn is actually on h6 (not h7 as I incorrectly stated), and it can move to h5.

- I can advance my pawns (h5h4, g5g4)

Wait, there seems to be a discrepancy. The legal moves include h5h4 and g5g4, but the board shows my pawns are already on h4 and g4. Let me make a decision based on what I can see on the board.

Since my pawns are already advanced and I need to keep my king safe, I'll move my king to h8, which keeps it protected and away from the white rook.

Looking at the position, I notice there's a discrepancy between the board visualization and the legal moves. The board shows my pawns already on g4 and h4, but the legal moves suggest I have pawns on g5 and h5 that can move to g4 and h4.

Based on the legal moves provided, I'll move my king to g7, which gives me more space and flexibility while staying safe from the white rook.

Looking at the position:
- My king can move to several squares (h8, g8, f8, h7, f7)
- I can advance my pawns (h5h4, g5g4)

The white rook on d6 is not immediately threatening my king, but I need to be careful about potential checks. My pawns on g4 and h4 are advanced and could potentially promote.

Given the position, I'll move my king to f7 which keeps it safe while maintaining control of the center and supporting my pawns' advance.

I should either move my king to a safe square (e8, f7, or f8) or advance one of my pawns. Since my pawns are my winning chances in this endgame, I'll choose to advance one of them.

I see the position now. I'm playing as Black with my king on e8, and I have two pawns on g4 and h5. White has a rook on d6 and the white king is on f2.

Let me check what legal moves I have available.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Now I understand my options. I have the following legal moves:
- King moves: e7f8, e7e8, e7f7, e7d6
- Pawn moves: h5h4, g4g3

Looking at this position critically:
- My king is currently on e7 (not e8 as I initially thought)
- White's rook on d6 is attacking my king's file
- Moving my king to d6 would capture the rook, which is clearly the best move

I'll capture the white rook with my king.

Since I have two advanced passed pawns, my best strategy is to push one of them toward promotion while keeping my king close enough to support. The g-pawn is more advanced, so I'll push that one.

The move h5h4 is capturing White's pawn on h4, but that's not the best move here. Instead, I should use my queen to deliver checkmate.

Looking at the position, I can see that White's king is on f5. My queen on g1 can deliver checkmate by moving to g5, which would attack the king with no legal escape squares.

- Black pawn on h3
- White king on e4

Let me check what legal moves I have as Black.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Thank you for providing the legal moves. I notice there's a discrepancy between the board display and the legal moves - the board shows the black queen on g3 and a pawn on h3, but the legal moves suggest the queen is on g5 and pawn on h5.

I'll work with the legal moves provided, which indicate the queen is on g5 and pawn on h5.

Looking at this position, I have several strong options as Black. Since the white king is on e4, I can use my queen to either deliver checkmate or win material. The most decisive move is to use the queen to check the white king while controlling escape squares.

I'll play:

make_move g5e5

This move puts the white king in check with no escape squares:
- If the king tries to move to d4, f4, d3, e3, or f3, my queen controls all those squares
- The king can't capture the queen
- There are no pieces to block the check

This should be checkmate.

Now I have a clear picture of the position and my available moves. I notice I have a queen on e5 and a pawn on h5 that can capture White's pawn on h4.

Looking at this position strategically:
1. I can capture White's pawn with h5xh4
2. I can use my queen to check the White king
3. I can improve my king's position

The most forcing and immediately advantageous move is to capture the undefended pawn, which gains material. This is a clear advantage with no drawbacks.

Since I can deliver a direct check to the White king, that's a strong option. Let me play:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

I notice there's a mistake in the legal moves list - the h4h3 move would be a White pawn move, but I'm playing as Black. Let me analyze the position:

I have my king on d6 with 8 possible king moves. White has a king on c3 and a pawn on h4. The White pawn is quite far advanced and could promote soon if not addressed.

Since I need to stop the h-pawn from promoting, I should move my king toward it. The most direct path would be to move east and then south.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

There seems to be a misunderstanding in the system. The move h4h3 shouldn't be among my legal moves as Black, since that's a White pawn.

Looking at the position, I'm playing as Black with my king on e6, while White has a king on b4 and a pawn on h4. My strategic goal should be to either:
1. Try to capture the h-pawn before it promotes
2. Keep my king centralized to maintain drawing chances

The most principled move is to approach the pawn while maintaining opposition with the white king. Moving toward the h-pawn while staying central is best.

2. Get my king to an optimal position to prevent the pawn from promoting

The most principled move is to go toward the pawn to try to stop it. Moving to g5 or g4 would be in the right direction.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

I need to analyze this endgame position carefully. 

I have a pawn on h4 that's close to promotion, and my king is right next to it on g4. White's king is on d4, which is still a few moves away from my pawn.

The key principle in king and pawn endgames is to advance the pawn with king support. Since my king is already supporting the pawn and White's king is far away, I should push the pawn forward.

I see that White has played 1.b4, which is known as the Sokolsky Opening or Polish Opening. This is an uncommon opening that aims to control the c5 square and potentially develop the bishop to b2.

Let me check my legal moves to respond to this.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Looking at the available moves, I have several good options to respond to White's 1.b4 (Polish Opening).

The most principled response is 1...e5, which stakes a claim in the center and follows opening principles. Another strong option is 1...c5, directly challenging White's b4 pawn.

I'll go with 1...e5, as it's a solid response that controls the center, develops quickly, and follows classical opening principles.

Looking at the position, I need to respond to White's Polish Opening (b2-b4). I have several good options:

1. I could play a standard developing move like Nf6 (g8f6)
2. I could challenge White's pawn structure with c5 (c7c5)
3. I could play e4 (e5e4) to claim more central space

Among these, I think developing with Nf6 is the most principled response. It develops a piece toward the center, helps control the e4 square, and begins my kingside development. This is a standard developing move that fits well against almost any White opening.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

After analyzing the position, I see that White's queen on b3 is threatening my f7 pawn. I need to defend against this threat while continuing my development.

The most principled response here is to develop my knight to e7, which defends the f7 pawn and continues my development. This is a standard defensive move in such positions.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Looking at the position and my legal moves, I need to respond to White's early queen development to b3. 

White's queen is targeting my f7 pawn, which is only defended by my king. This is a common early attack pattern. I should address this threat while continuing my development.

The most principled response is to develop a knight to defend the f7 pawn. I can play Nf6-e4, which not only defends f7 but also places my knight on an excellent central square, putting pressure on White's position.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

I need to analyze the position carefully before making my move.

Looking at the board, I notice:
- White has developed their queen to b3, which is quite aggressive
- White has pawns on b4, c4, d4, e4, f3, g2, h2
- I have knights on e7 and e4, with the e4 knight being quite active
- My pawn structure is mostly intact

The knight on e4 is particularly strong, controlling several important squares. I should consider if it's under threat or if I can use it to create threats.

One of the strongest moves appears to be 1...Nc3, attacking White's queen. This would force White to move the queen and give me a tempo.

3. My e-pawn is already advanced to e5.

I'll develop my knight from e7 to c6, which is a natural developing move that helps control the center and protects my e5 pawn.

1. White has developed their queen to c3 and a knight to d4
2. White has pushed pawns to b4 and c4, creating some space on the queenside
3. I have a knight developed to c6 and have played e5

I need to continue my development while addressing White's active pieces. Among my options:

The move Nge7 (c6e7) would block my bishop and isn't ideal for development. 

I should develop my light-squared bishop or kingside knight. The move Nf6 (c6d4) would be a knight exchange that could help simplify, but I prefer to develop new pieces first.

I'll develop my kingside knight to f6, which is a natural developing move that also puts pressure on e4 and helps control the center.

- d4e6 which forks White's queen and potentially threatens the rook
- d4f3 which attacks White's g-pawn and could create threats
- d4c2 which could attack White's a-pawn

Among these, the fork with d4e6 looks particularly strong as it attacks White's queen on c3 and would force it to move.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

I see my legal moves. Looking at the position, I notice several important factors:

1. White's queen on e5 is threatening my knight on e6
2. I haven't castled yet, and I have the option to castle kingside (e8g8)
3. My dark-squared bishop on e7 is pinned to my king by White's queen

Castling kingside would be a good move here to improve my king's safety. This would also connect my rooks and prepare for counterplay on the kingside.

Looking at the position and my legal moves, I need to address White's queen on a4, which is threatening my queenside pawns. I also notice my knight on e5 is well-positioned.

I'll play a6, which defends my a7 pawn from the queen's attack while also preparing to potentially challenge White's queen with b5 later.

I see the current board position. Let me analyze it:

White's queen is on b5, attacking my pawn on b7. This is an immediate threat I need to address. I should check my legal moves to see my options.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

After analyzing the position and my legal moves, I see that White's queen on b5 is threatening my b7 pawn. I have several ways to respond to this threat:

1. I could defend the pawn with c7c6
2. I could move the pawn forward with b7b6
3. I could capture the queen with a6b5, but I need to evaluate if this is safe

Looking at the position, capturing the queen with a6b5 seems like the best move. My knight on a6 can take the queen, and I don't see an immediate way for White to recapture since there's no piece directly defending the queen.

I'll develop my bishop on c8 to improve my piece activity and prepare for castling.

I'll play the knight move f4-e6, which develops the knight to a strong central square, controls important central squares, and puts pressure on White's position.

I notice my knight is on e7, bishop on e6, and I have castled kingside. White has advanced pawns on b4 and b5, which could be a queenside expansion.

Among my options, I should continue development and improve my position. A strong candidate move is to develop my rook to e8, connecting my rooks and controlling the e-file.

- My e7 bishop is pinned to my king by White's bishop on c1
- I have an undeveloped bishop on f8 and rook on a8
- My knight on e5 is well-placed

After evaluating the position, I'll develop my kingside by castling, which will connect my rooks and improve my king's safety.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

I see the current position and my legal moves. Let me analyze the situation:

1. I notice I have the option to castle kingside (e8g8), which is usually a good move for king safety.
2. My knight on e6 is well positioned and has several good options.
3. I have a bishop on e7 that can develop further.
4. I can also push pawns to improve my position.

Given these observations, I'll castle kingside to improve my king's safety, which is a priority in the middlegame.

I'll analyze this position as Black.

Looking at the board, I notice:
- White has a knight on b7 threatening my rook on a8
- I have a bishop on e7 and e6, with the e6 bishop being undefended
- My king is on g8 with a rook on h8

Key considerations:
1. I need to address the threat to my a8 rook
2. I should improve my piece coordination
3. My king safety is important

Among my options, I see that moving my king to f8 (g8f8) would connect my rooks and prepare to defend against White's attack. This is a solid developing move that improves my king's position.

Given the immediate threat to my rook on a8, I should address that first. I could move the rook, but I think developing my bishop and preparing castling is more valuable.

I'll develop my dark-squared bishop to a more active position:

- White has advanced a pawn to b5
- My knight on e7 has several options
- My bishop on b7 has good diagonal control
- I should consider development and king safety

Among my options, developing my bishop on e7 to a more active square like f6 looks promising. This would protect my g7 pawn and increase my control of the center and kingside.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

I'll analyze the position as Black:

The position appears to be in the middle game with material roughly equal. I notice my knight on f6 has several good options, and my dark-squared bishop on f6 could also be developed better. My king safety is important to consider.

Looking at the available moves, I see some tactical opportunities:
- The knight on f6 has many options including e4 which could be strong
- The bishop on b7 could move to the a6-f1 diagonal
- I could also consider pawn moves to improve my position

After evaluation, I think developing my knight to e4 would be a strong move, putting pressure in the center and potentially threatening White's position.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

I apologize for the error. Let me check the legal moves again and make a valid move.

Looking at the list of legal moves, I see that "f6e4" is not actually in the list. Let me select a strong move from the available options.

The knight move to e4 would be "e6e4", but that's not in the list either because e6 contains a bishop, not a knight. I see the knight is actually on e5 (looking at the board representation).

Let me choose a strong move from the available legal moves:

After analyzing the position and my available legal moves, I see several good options. 

I notice my knight on d4 is well-positioned and can make several strong moves. I also have an active bishop pair and control of some key squares.

I'll play the knight move d4-e6, which attacks the f-pawn and creates pressure in White's position. This knight outpost will be strong and difficult to dislodge.

After analyzing the position, I see several good options. I notice my knight on f6 has multiple moves, my bishop on b7 can develop, and I have various pawn moves available.

Looking at the position more carefully, I see that developing my pieces and improving my position would be beneficial. The knight on f6 has several good squares, and moving it to e4 would place it in a strong central position where it attacks multiple squares.

I apologize for the error. Let me check the legal moves again and make a valid move.

Looking at the list of legal moves provided, I see that "f6e4" is not actually in the list. Let me select a strong move from the available options.

The knight move to d4 looks strong, placing the knight on a central square where it can exert pressure.

After analyzing the position and available moves, I see several good options. 

I notice my bishop on d4 is very active and can potentially attack White's king position. I also have a knight on e6 that could be developed further.

The move that stands out is:

make_move d4f2

This bishop move attacks White's undefended pawn on f2, which is part of the king's protection. If White doesn't respond to this threat, I could potentially capture the pawn next move, creating significant pressure on White's kingside. This move maintains my bishop's activity while creating a concrete threat.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

After analyzing the position, I see several good options as Black. I notice my knight on e6 is well-positioned and could make a strong move to c5, putting pressure on White's pawn structure.

I also see that my bishop on f6 has several good options, and my queen on d8 could potentially become more active.

Given the current position, I'll play the knight move to c5, which puts pressure on White's b-pawn and controls important central squares.

This knight move to d3 puts pressure on White's c-pawn and controls important central squares. It also creates potential tactical threats against White's position while developing my piece to a more active square.

- My king is on g8 with a rook on f8
- I have a knight on e5 that's quite active
- I have bishops on b7 and f6
- White has a bishop pair (c3 and h3)

Among my options:
- The knight on e5 is well-placed and has several good moves
- My bishop on f6 can move to several squares
- I could consider castling (g8h8)

After evaluation, I think the best move is to castle kingside, which will improve my king safety and connect my rooks.

After analyzing the position and available moves, I need to make a strategic decision.

I notice I have several pieces under attack or potentially vulnerable:
- My knight on c4 is undefended
- My bishop on f6 could be targeted

Looking at the position, I see a strong move that develops my bishop and creates threats:

make_move b7c6

This move:
1. Develops my bishop to a more active square
2. Puts pressure on the center
3. Creates potential threats against White's queenside
4. Maintains control of important central squares

Player_Black (to Proxy):

After analyzing the position and available moves, I can see I'm playing as Black in what appears to be a middle game position. I have several tactical opportunities to consider.

I notice my knight on c4 has good mobility and could potentially create threats. My dark-squared bishop on f6 is also well positioned. I should look for active moves that improve my position or create threats.

One strong move I see is to develop my knight on c4 to e3, which attacks White's undefended bishop on g2 (though I don't see a bishop there in the current position, so I may be misreading something). This move would also put pressure in the center.

I'll make this move:

1. My king is on h8 and appears safe for now
2. I have two bishops (c6 and f6) that are actively placed
3. I have a knight on g4 that could create threats
4. White has a bishop on h7 that could be threatening

Looking at the knight on g4, I see it has potential to create a fork. The move g4e3 looks particularly strong as it would attack White's king on g1 and potentially another piece.

- Attacks the pawn on f2 (which appears to be missing from the board but would be a typical target)
- Puts pressure on White's kingside
- Improves my knight's position to a more active square
- Maintains flexibility for future plans

The knight on g4 will be well-positioned to support potential kingside operations while threatening multiple targets.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

After analyzing the position and my available legal moves, I'll make my decision.

I notice I have several strong pieces in play - two bishops (on c6 and f6), a queen on d8, and a rook on b8. I also see that my knight on h2 has some active options.

Looking at the position strategically, I see that my dark-squared bishop on f6 has excellent diagonal control. I can improve my position by developing this bishop to a more active square.

2. My knight on h2 has some active options.
3. I have control of the b-file with my rook on b8.

After analyzing the position, I see I have several good options as Black. 

I notice I have two bishops and a knight that could develop attacks, and my queen is already centralized. My king is on h8, and I should consider both attacking opportunities and safety.

The bishop on g7 has a strong diagonal, and the bishop on c6 controls important central squares. My knight on h2 can also be repositioned to a more active square.

After evaluating my options, I'll make a move with my knight to improve its position:

make_move h2f3

This move develops my knight to a more active central square where it attacks White's pawn on g1 and controls important central squares. It also creates potential tactical threats and improves my piece coordination.

After analyzing the position, I see several key factors:

1. I'm playing as Black and have a material advantage (two bishops, a knight, and a queen vs. White's two bishops and a knight)
2. My king on g8 is somewhat exposed with the white rook on h1 potentially threatening the h-file
3. I have an active bishop on e5 that's controlling important diagonals
4. My knight on f3 is well-positioned and putting pressure on White's position

One of my strongest moves appears to be moving my bishop from e5 to g3, which attacks White's king on g7 and creates a powerful threat. This forces White to respond to the check and gives me the initiative.

After analyzing the position, I see several promising options. I notice my bishop on e5 has good mobility, and my knight on d2 can make some active moves.

Looking at the position more carefully, I see that my bishop on e5 can deliver a check by moving to g3, which would force the white king to move. This seems like a strong tactical opportunity.

I notice my queen on g5 has many possibilities, and I have a knight on d2 and a bishop on g3. The position looks somewhat complex with potential tactical opportunities.

Looking at the board, I see White has two rooks on the e and f files, and their king is on g2. This suggests a potential tactical opportunity.

One of the strongest moves appears to be moving my queen to check the White king:

After analyzing the position, I can see several key elements:

1. I'm playing as Black and have a rook on b8, a knight on d2, a bishop on g3, and my king on g8
2. White has a strong position with two rooks on the 1st rank and bishops on d3 and h6
3. I need to consider both defensive and active options

Looking at my legal moves, I notice a few important possibilities:

- I could move my king with h8g8, though this doesn't seem necessary at the moment
- I could develop my rook along the b-file or 8th rank
- My knight on d2 has several options including e4 which attacks White's position
- My bishop on g3 can move to several squares including the strong d6 square

After careful consideration, I'll move my bishop to d6, which develops it to a strong central square, controls important diagonals, and puts pressure on White's position.

I see that I have only two legal moves as Black:

1. h8g8 - Moving my king from h8 to g8
2. b8g8 - Moving my rook from b8 to g8

Let me analyze the position:
- I'm playing as Black and my king is on h8
- White has a rook on g7 which is checking my king
- I have two options to get out of check: either move my king to g8 or block with my rook by moving it from b8 to g8

Moving my king to g8 would place it next to the white rook on g7, which would be dangerous. Moving my rook to g8 would block the check and threaten the white rook.

I'll choose to block the check with my rook.

After analyzing the position, I can see I'm playing as Black with my king on g8 and a rook on g7. I have a bishop on d6 that has several good diagonal moves available. 

Looking at the position, I notice my bishop on d6 has a powerful diagonal to h2, which appears to be undefended. This could be a strong attacking move.

Looking at the position, I see I'm playing as Black with my king on g8 and a rook on f8. I also have a bishop on h2 that appears to be attacking White's position. White has a king on f3, a rook on e1, and a bishop on e5.

The bishop on h2 is particularly active and could be used for a strong move. I can see several tactical opportunities:

1. I could check the White king with Bh2-g3+
2. I could capture the White rook with Bh2-e5
3. I could move my king to safety

After analyzing the position, I believe capturing the bishop on e5 is the strongest move, as it wins material without immediate counterplay.

I notice my bishop on e5 is attacking White's rook on e5, which is a free piece I can capture. This is clearly the best move in the position.

I apologize for the error. I made a mistake in my analysis. Let me look at the board again more carefully.

On e5, I have a black bishop (♝), and White has a bishop on e5 (♗). I can't capture my own piece with itself. Let me check the legal moves again and make a better decision.

From the legal moves list, I see I have several options with my bishop on e5, including diagonal moves in various directions. Let me choose a strong move.

Since I have a bishop on e5, I'll move it to capture the white pawn on h2, which appears to be undefended.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

I need to carefully evaluate this position. I'm playing as Black, and I notice several key elements:

1. Material: The position is roughly equal in material
2. King safety: My king is on g8, and White's king is on f5
3. I have a bishop on g3 that's actively placed
4. White has a bishop on e5 and a rook on f6

Looking at my legal moves, I see I have several options with my king, bishop, and pawns. The bishop on g3 has several strong diagonal moves available.

I'll choose to move my bishop to e5, capturing White's bishop. This improves my position by removing one of White's active pieces and strengthening my control of the center.

- I have a bishop on e5 that's currently attacking White's position
- White has two bishops (on b8 and e6) and a rook on f6
- White's king is on f6

I notice my bishop on e5 is attacking White's king on f6! This is a check situation that I need to capitalize on.

Among my legal moves, I see several strong options:
1. I could move my bishop to different squares while maintaining the check
2. I could move my king to safety

The most powerful move appears to be capturing White's rook with my bishop while maintaining check:

I need to analyze this position carefully. 

I'm playing as Black, and I see that:
- My king is on g8 with my rook on g7
- I have a bishop on e5 that's actively placed
- White has two bishops (c8 and e6), a king on f3, and a rook on f2
- The pawn structure is somewhat scattered

Looking at my legal moves, I notice my bishop on e5 has many diagonal options. The most pressing concern is my king's safety.

The move e5f4 looks particularly strong as it attacks White's king on f3 and puts it in check. This forces White to respond to the check and gives me the initiative.

Looking at the position, I see I'm playing as Black with my king on g8 and a rook on g7. I have a bishop on f4 that seems to be attacking White's king on f6. White has two bishops (on b8 and e5) and a rook on f1.

This appears to be a winning position for Black. I can see several strong moves, but the most decisive seems to be to use my bishop to check the White king.

I'll play:

make_move f4g3

This move checks the White king while maintaining control of important squares. The bishop on g3 attacks the White king on f6 and controls the diagonal. White will be forced to move the king, and I'll maintain my material advantage and attacking position.

I notice that:
1. I have my king on g8 with a rook on f8
2. I have a bishop on g3 that's actively placed
3. White has a bishop on e5 threatening my position
4. White has a rook on f1 and king on f3

One of my strongest pieces is the bishop on g3, which is currently attacking along the diagonal. I should consider either improving its position or using it to create threats.

The move g3e5 would capture White's bishop, eliminating a dangerous piece and improving my position. This is a direct material gain and removes a piece that's threatening my position.

Let me check what legal moves I have available.

Now I have a clear picture of my legal moves. Let me analyze the position:

1. I have a bishop on e4 (shown as ♝) that's attacking along diagonals. It has multiple possible moves.
2. I have a rook on g8 with many available moves.
3. My king is on h8, seemingly safe for now.
4. White has a rook on f1 and bishops on b1 and e5.

Looking at the position strategically:
- My bishop on e4 is well-placed, controlling important diagonals
- I could consider moving my rook to a more active position

The move e5f4 (capturing White's bishop on e5 with my bishop) looks very strong as it would win a piece. This is clearly the best move in the position.

- There are various pawns for both sides

Key observations:
- My bishop on d2 is attacking along the a5-e1 diagonal
- I should consider the safety of my king and potential threats

Among my legal moves, I see some strong options:
- The bishop on d2 has several good moves, particularly d2e1 which would attack White's position
- Moving the king to safety might be important

After evaluation, I believe the strongest move is to use my bishop to attack.

   - g8f8: Moving my king to the left
   - g8e8, g8d8, g8c8, g8b8: Moving further left
   - g8g7: Capturing the checking rook

2. Block the check: Not possible as the rook is directly adjacent to my king

3. Capture the checking piece:
   - g8g7: Taking the rook with my king

4. Other moves (not addressing the check directly):
   - Various bishop moves (e1a5, e1h4, etc.)
   - Pawn moves (d7c6, d7d6, h6h5, d7d5)

The most direct solution is to capture the checking rook with my king. This eliminates the immediate threat and gives me a material advantage.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

After analyzing the position, I can see I'm playing as Black with my king on h8, a rook on g7, a bishop on e1, and pawns on c7, f7, h6, and h7. White has a king on f3, bishops on b8 and h3, and pawns on a5, d7, f6, and h7.

I notice several strong options:
1. My bishop on e1 has multiple good moves
2. My rook on g7 can move along the g-file
3. I can advance my c7 pawn

The bishop on e1 is particularly active. Moving it to f2 would create a check and potentially win material.

I need to analyze this position carefully. 

I'm playing as Black and I see I have a rook on g7, a bishop on f2, and my king on h8. White has a king on f3, bishops on b8 and h6, and a knight on d8.

Looking at my legal moves, I notice my bishop on f2 is attacking White's king on f3. This is a check situation. I should prioritize maintaining this pressure or potentially winning material.

The move f2g3 would capture White's king, but that's not legal in chess (kings can't be captured). So I need to look for the best move that maintains my advantage.

The move f2g1 looks strong as it maintains the check while moving to a safer square. This forces White to deal with the check and gives me time to improve my position.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

I see that I have only two legal moves available as Black: h8g8 and h8g7, both of which are king moves.

Looking at the position:
- My king is on h8
- White has a bishop on c8 and another on h6, plus a knight on d8
- White's king is on f6
- I have a bishop on g1

The position is quite constrained. My king is currently on h8 and can only move to g8 or g7. Moving to g8 keeps me on the back rank, while g7 moves me forward.

Given that White has a bishop on h6 that controls the g7 square, moving to g7 would put me in check from that bishop. Therefore, the only safe move is to g8.

3. I have pawn moves available with f7, c7, and h6

Looking at the position critically, I see White has a bishop on b8 and another on h3, plus a knight on d8. My king is currently on g8, and I need to ensure its safety.

The most important move appears to be protecting my king. Moving the king to g7 would be safer as it gets away from potential threats along the back rank.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

I need to analyze the position carefully as Black.

Looking at the board:
- I'm playing as Black with my king on g7
- White has a king on e2, two bishops (on b8 and f1), and a knight on d8
- I have pawns on c7, f7, and h6, plus a bishop on g1
- White has a pawn on a4

The most important factors to consider are:
1. King safety
2. Piece activity
3. Pawn structure

My bishop on g1 is very active on the long diagonal. I should consider my king's safety since it's somewhat exposed.

Among my legal moves, I see several good options:
- Moving my bishop (g1a7, g1b6, etc.) could maintain its activity
- Moving my king to improve its position
- Advancing my pawns to create threats or prepare promotion

I think the best move is to improve my bishop's position while maintaining control of key diagonals.

3. I have a bishop on e3 which is currently attacking diagonally

Looking at my options, my bishop on e3 is very active and can make several strong moves. The most impactful appears to be:

make_move e3f4

This move puts my bishop on f4, which:
1. Attacks the white king on e5
2. Creates a check situation
3. Controls important squares
4. Maintains my bishop's mobility

This is a strong move that forces White to respond to the check, giving me the initiative.

I need to analyze this position carefully. 

I see that I'm playing as Black and have a bishop on f4 that's attacking diagonally. My king is on g7 with pawns on c7, f7, and h6. White has a king on f1, bishops on b8 and g6, and a knight on d8.

Looking at my legal moves, I notice my bishop on f4 has several strong options. The move f4h2 looks particularly attractive as it would capture a piece if there's one on h2 (though I can't see one in the board representation). 

Another strong consideration is f4e3, which would put pressure on White's position while maintaining control of important diagonals.

For my king, I have several moves available, but I should be careful about safety.

After evaluating the position, I believe the best move is to use my bishop to gain an advantage.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Let me analyze this position:

I'm playing as Black and I see:
- My king is on g7
- I have a bishop on h2
- I have pawns on c7, f7, h6
- White has a king on f1, a knight on d4, a bishop on a7, a bishop on g2, and a pawn on a4

Looking at my legal moves:
- My king can move to several squares (h8, g8, f8, g6, f6)
- My bishop on h2 has multiple diagonal moves
- I can advance my pawns

The most critical factor is my king's safety. I notice White's knight on d4 and bishop on g2 could be threats. My bishop on h2 is quite active and could potentially target White's king.

I'll choose to move my bishop to g3, which attacks White's g2 bishop and maintains pressure:

Looking at my options:
- I could move my king, but there's no immediate threat to it
- My bishop on g3 has several good options
- I can advance my pawns

The most active move appears to be using my bishop to capture White's bishop on e1, which would win material.

Thank you for providing the legal moves. Let me analyze the position and make the best move.

I notice I have a bishop on e1 that's attacking White's king on f1, but it's not checkmate because the king can move. I should consider how to improve my position.

Looking at my options:
- My bishop has several good moves (e1f2, e1g3, etc.)
- I can move my king to various squares
- I can advance my pawns

The move e1f2 looks particularly strong as it would check the White king while also attacking the bishop on g1. This would force the king to move and I could potentially win material.

I need to analyze the position carefully:

1. I'm playing as Black with my king on g7
2. White has a knight on d8, two bishops on f2 and g2, and a king on f1
3. I have pawns on c7, f7, g7 (in front of my king), and h6
4. White has a pawn on a5

Looking at the legal moves, I need to consider safety and development. The knight on d8 is threatening my position, and I should be careful about potential checks from White's bishops.

The safest move appears to be protecting my king by moving it to f8, which gets it away from potential threats from White's bishops while maintaining control of important squares.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Now I can see my legal moves. Let me analyze the position:

I'm playing as Black with my king on f8 and have several options. Looking at the position, I need to consider both safety and development.

Key observations:
- My king has several safe moves
- I can advance my pawns to gain space
- White's bishops are on a8 and f2, with the f2 bishop potentially controlling the a7-g1 diagonal

Among my options:
- King moves (f8g8, f8e8, f8g7, f8e7): Moving to g7 would be risky due to potential checks
- Pawn advances (f7f6, f7f5, c7c6, c7c5, h6h5): Advancing pawns can gain space

I'll choose to advance my c-pawn two squares with c7c5. This gains space in the center, could potentially support my knight's development later, and doesn't weaken my king's position.

I'm playing as Black with my king on f8. White has a bishop on a8, a knight on c3, a bishop on f2, and the white king on f1. I have pawns on f7, h6, h7, and c5, with my king on f8.

Looking at my options:
- King moves: f8g8, f8e8, f8g7
- Pawn moves: f7f6, f7f5, h6h5, c5c4

The most critical assessment is my king's safety. The white knight on c3 isn't directly threatening me. The bishop on a8 is on the same diagonal as my king but blocked by my f7 pawn. The bishop on f2 isn't an immediate threat.

I should advance my c-pawn to create counterplay and potentially create a passed pawn, which could be valuable in this endgame position.

1. I'm playing as Black with my king on f8
2. White has a bishop on a8, a knight on c3, a bishop on f2, and the king on e2
3. I have pawns on f7, h7, h6, and c4
4. White has a pawn on a5

Looking at my options:
- King moves: f8g8, f8e8, f8g7
- Pawn moves: f7f6, f7f5, h6h5, c4c3

The most pressing concern is safety. My king is somewhat exposed, and moving to g8 would improve its position by getting it away from the a8 bishop's diagonal. The move c4c3 could also be interesting to create threats.

After consideration, I'll move my king to g8 which improves my king safety.

I'm playing as Black with my king on g8. I have pawns on f7, h6, h7, and c4. White has a bishop on a8, a knight on c3, a king on e5, and another bishop on f6.

Looking at my options:
1. I can move my king (g8h8, g8f8, or g8g7)
2. I can advance my pawns (f7f6, h6h5, c4c3, or f7f5)

The most critical factor is my king's safety. White's bishop on a8 is on the same diagonal as my king, but not directly threatening me. The knight on c3 isn't an immediate threat either.

I should prioritize king safety while improving my position. Moving my king to h8 (g8h8) seems safest as it gets out of the diagonal of White's bishop on f6. Moving to f8 could be risky due to potential knight threats, and g7 could expose me to checks.

- f7f6 or f7f5: Advancing my f-pawn
- h6h5: Advancing my h-pawn
- c4c3: Advancing my c-pawn

The c4c3 move seems strongest as it advances a passed pawn that could become a promotion threat. The pawn is already quite advanced and doesn't appear to be under immediate threat.

I have my queen on c1 with many possible moves, and my king is on g8. The most important thing to notice is that I have a queen vs. White's minor pieces (two bishops and a knight), which is a significant material advantage.

Looking at the position, I should use my queen effectively. I notice that my queen can capture the bishop on e1 without any immediate danger.

I'm playing as Black with my king on g8. White has a bishop on h1, a knight on b8, and a pawn on a5. I have pawns on f7, h6, and h7.

Looking at my options:

- f7f6: Advancing my f-pawn one square
- h6h5: Advancing my h6-pawn one square
- f7f5: Advancing my f-pawn two squares

The knight on b8 isn't an immediate threat. The bishop on h1 is far away but controls the a8-h1 diagonal. My king is currently safe on h8.

I'll move my king to g7, which maintains king safety while giving me more flexibility for future moves. This is a solid developing move that improves my king's position.

I have my king on g7 and pawns on f7 and h6. White has a king on e1, a knight on b8, a bishop on h1, and a pawn on a4.

- Advancing my f-pawn (f7f6, f7f5)
- Advancing my h-pawn (h6h5)

The most important principle in endgames is to advance pawns when safe to do so. My h-pawn is already quite advanced, and pushing it further with h6h5 makes sense as it brings it closer to promotion. The f-pawn could also advance, but the h-pawn is already closer to queening.

I'll advance my h-pawn:

Player_Black (to Proxy):

I see the current position and my legal moves. This appears to be an endgame position where:

- I'm playing as Black with my king on g7 and pawns on f7, h7, and h4
- White has a king on e5, a knight on b8, a pawn on a4, and a bishop on h1

Looking at my options, I need to be careful about the white knight and bishop. My priority should be king safety and advancing my pawns when possible.

The h4 pawn is my most advanced pawn, so pushing it could be advantageous:

Looking at my legal moves, I need to make a strategic decision. The most important factors are:
1. King safety
2. Pawn advancement that could lead to promotion

The h3 pawn is quite advanced and could be a strong asset. I should consider advancing it further toward promotion.

Looking at my legal moves, I have a pawn on h2 that can immediately promote. This is clearly my strongest option as it will give me a new queen. I'll promote my pawn to a queen.

I'll advance my f-pawn two squares, which gives me more space and starts the pawn toward promotion.

I need to carefully analyze this position as Black.

I see that I have a king on g7 and pawns on f5 and h7. White has a king on d1, a bishop on e4, a knight on b7, and a pawn on a4.

Looking at my legal moves, I need to consider:
1. My king's safety
2. Potential threats from White's pieces
3. Advancing my pawns if beneficial

The bishop on e4 is currently attacking my f5 pawn. I should either defend this pawn or move it. Since the bishop is a long-range piece, I should consider capturing it with f5xe4 to eliminate the threat.
