I notice that I can develop my bishop and prepare for castling. One of the strong moves here is to develop the light-squared bishop to e6 or f5, which would control important diagonals and prepare for kingside castling.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

I'll analyze the position to make a strong move as Black.

Looking at the board, I notice:
- I have two knights (c6 and f6) and two bishops (f5 and f8)
- White has advanced pawns in the center (c3, d3, e4)
- My d5 pawn is facing White's e4 pawn

Among my options, I see several strong candidate moves:

1. f5e4 - Bishop takes pawn on e4, attacking the center
2. f6e4 - Knight takes pawn on e4, also attacking the center
3. c6d4 - Knight to d4, putting pressure on the center
4. d5e4 - Pawn takes pawn on e4, gaining space in the center

The bishop move f5e4 looks particularly strong as it captures a pawn while developing my bishop's activity. This move would put pressure on White's position and gain material.

Thank you for the clarification. Looking at the board again, I see that my bishop is on e4, and White has a knight on e5, not the other way around. 

After analyzing the position more carefully, I see that one of my strongest moves is to play c6e5, capturing White's knight with my own knight. This removes a well-placed White piece and strengthens my control of the center.

I notice my knight on e5 is well-placed and has several good options. One particularly strong move is to develop my dark-squared bishop on e4 to f3, which would attack White's king on d4 and create a powerful threat.

After analyzing the position and the available legal moves, I notice a few key things:

1. My king is in the center (e8) and White's king appears to be on d4
2. I have a bishop on f3 that's actively placed
3. I have knights on e5 and f6 that are centralized
4. I need to continue development and improve my king safety

One of the strongest moves here would be to castle kingside, which would immediately improve my king safety:

I notice my knight on e5 is well-positioned and my bishop on f3 is actively placed on the long diagonal. The position appears somewhat open with both kings castled (White's king on c2 and my king on e8).

Among my options, I see a strong tactical opportunity with my bishop on f3, which is targeting White's position. The move f3g2 looks particularly strong as it attacks White's rook on h1 while also threatening the pawn on h2.

Looking at the board, I notice:
- I have two knights on b2 and f2, and two bishops on g2 and f8
- White's king is on c3, somewhat exposed
- I have a pawn on d5 that could be vulnerable

One of the strongest moves appears to be developing my knight from f2 to e4, which attacks White's pawn on f6 and puts pressure in the center. This knight move also creates a potential fork threat against White's king and other pieces.

I need to analyze the position carefully. I notice I have a knight on e4 and a bishop on g2, both actively placed. The position appears to be in the middle game with some development already completed.

Looking at the available moves, I see several strong options:
- My knight on e4 has multiple attacking possibilities
- My bishop on g2 is targeting the kingside
- I could continue development with moves like e7-e6

The white king appears to be on b2, which is somewhat exposed. My knight on e4 can potentially create threats with moves like e4-f2 or e4-d2, which could fork pieces.

After careful consideration, I'll play e4-f2, which attacks the white king and creates a strong tactical threat.

I need to analyze the position carefully before making my move.

Looking at the board, I notice:
- I have a knight on f2 and a bishop on g2 that are developed
- My king is on e8 and appears to be uncastled
- White has a king on b2, which is unusual (likely after castling queenside)
- I have a pawn on d5 that could be vulnerable

Among my options, I should consider:
1. Developing more pieces
2. Improving king safety
3. Attacking opportunities

The knight on f2 has several good options, including e4 which would attack White's center. The bishop on g2 also has mobility.

After consideration, I'll move my knight to e4, which centralizes it, attacks White's center, and creates threats.

Looking at the position, I notice I have a bishop on g2 that's attacking the white king on b2, and a knight on e4 in a strong central position. 

The most critical move appears to be with my bishop on g2, which is currently pinning the white king to its position. I can consider moves like Bg2-f3 to maintain pressure.

My knight on e4 is also well-placed and has several good options, including Nf6 which would attack the queen on b3.

After analyzing the position, I'll make my move:

Looking at my options, the bishop on g2 is very powerful and I should consider how to maximize its effect. I also need to be careful about potential threats.

One strong move is to develop my rook by connecting them:

I notice I'm playing as Black and the position looks complex. My king is on e8, and I see that White has a queen on b3 which could be threatening. I also have a bishop on e4 that's active and could potentially create threats.

Looking at the legal moves, I see several strong possibilities:
- The bishop on e4 has multiple attacking options (f3, d3, g2, h1)
- I could develop my knight on f6 to d7 or h5
- I could move my queen from d8 to d7 or d6

The bishop on e4 is particularly strong, and I should consider using it to create threats. Moving it to g2 would attack White's king on b2, which could be very powerful.

The bishop on g2 is particularly strong and threatens White's position. I should consider whether to maintain it or use it to capture something valuable.

I also need to ensure my king's safety and continue development.

Among the legal moves, I see that my bishop on g2 can capture on e4, which would win a pawn. This looks like a strong move that improves my position.

One of the strongest moves appears to be developing my bishop with e4f3, attacking White's queen on b3. This would put immediate pressure on my opponent.

d8d7,f6d7,c7c6,b7b5

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

I need to analyze the current position carefully before making my move.

Looking at the board:
- White has a queen on a4, which is quite active
- I have a knight on f6 and a bishop on f5
- My king on e8 is still in the center
- White's king is on b2, which is unusual but seems safe
- I have limited legal moves: d8d7 (queen move), f6d7 (knight move), c7c6, or b7b5

Evaluating my options:
1. d8d7 (Queen to d7): This blocks my c8 rook and doesn't improve my position much
2. f6d7 (Knight to d7): This knight is well-placed on f6, moving it doesn't seem beneficial
3. c7c6: A solid pawn move that strengthens my position and prepares for development
4. b7b5: An aggressive pawn move but could weaken my queenside

The move c7c6 seems most principled - it strengthens my pawn structure, helps control the center, and prepares for further development. It's a solid positional move.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

I can see I have only 4 legal moves available as Black. Let me analyze the position:

1. `d8d7` - Moving my queen from d8 to d7
2. `c8c6` - Moving my rook from c8 to c6
3. `f6d7` - Moving my knight from f6 to d7
4. `b7c6` - Moving my pawn from b7 to c6

Looking at the board, I notice White's queen is on c3 attacking my position. My king on e8 needs protection, and I need to address the queen threat. 

The knight move `f6d7` seems strongest as it develops a piece while protecting key squares. It blocks the queen's attack along the c-file and defends against potential threats.

I notice I have a bishop on f3 that's actively placed and can attack several squares. I also see that White's queen is on d4, which is potentially threatening my position. My king is on e8, and I should consider its safety.

Looking at the available moves, I see a few strong candidates:
- Moving my bishop on f3 to attack White's pieces
- Developing my rook on c8
- Protecting my king with a pawn move

One particularly strong move is f3e2, which would attack White's king on b2 with my bishop. This would be a check and force White to respond to the threat.

- I have a bishop on f3 that's very active and could be a strong piece
- White has a knight on a4 that could be threatening
- My king's position seems relatively safe

Among my options, I see a few strong candidates:
- Moving my bishop (f3) to attack key squares or pieces
- Developing my rook at c8
- Protecting my knight on d7 or moving it to a better square

The bishop on f3 is particularly powerful, and I can use it to create threats. I'll move it to e4, where it attacks White's pawn on d3 and controls important central squares.

I'll analyze the position:

1. White's queen is on e5, attacking my knight on d7 and bishop on e4.
2. My bishop on e4 is attacking White's pawn on h1 and is pinning White's pawn on d3.
3. I have a knight on d7 that's under attack.
4. My queen on d8 has several possible moves.

The most pressing issue is my knight on d7 being attacked by White's queen. I should either move it or defend it. Looking at the legal moves, I see several strong options:

1. I could move the knight to f6 (d7f6), which develops it to a good square and defends against the queen's attack.
2. I could move my bishop on e4 with a threat, particularly e4g2 which threatens White's king.
3. I could move my queen to protect the knight with d8c7.

After consideration, I'll move my bishop to g2, creating a powerful threat against White's king on b2, which forces an immediate response.

2. My knight on d7 has several potential moves
3. I have a rook on c8 that could be developed

One of the strongest moves I see is `g2e4`, moving my bishop to e4 where it attacks White's queen on f5 while also controlling important central squares. This forces White to move the queen and gives me the initiative.

One strong move is to develop my bishop from c8 to c5, which puts pressure on the d4 pawn and improves my piece activity.

One of the most powerful moves I see is to use my bishop on g2, which is attacking diagonally and could create threats. I also have active rook on c5 that could be utilized.

Looking at the bishop on g2, I can see it has several strong diagonal moves available. Moving it to e4 would place it centrally and attack the white position.

After analyzing the position, I see several good options. I notice I have two bishops, a knight, and two rooks as my main pieces, with my queen on d8. The position appears somewhat complex with my rook on c5 being quite active.

Looking at the most promising moves:
- The rook on c5 has many options and is currently quite active
- My bishop on f3 has several diagonal moves
- I could develop my knight on d7

I think the most impactful move is to use my bishop on f3 to attack the white king on d3, creating a strong threat.

Looking at the legal moves, I see several strong options:
- The bishop on h5 has multiple diagonal moves
- I can develop my knight on d7 to better squares
- I have pawn moves to improve my structure

I'll choose to develop my knight from d7 to e5, which centralizes it, attacks the c4 square, and puts pressure on White's position.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

I'll analyze the position to make the best move as Black.

Looking at the board, I notice:
- I have a queen on d8, king on e8, and bishops on f8 and h5
- My knight on e5 is active and controls several squares
- White has a knight on b7 that's threatening my a-pawn

Key considerations:
1. The knight on e5 is well-placed and could potentially be used for an attack
2. My bishop on h5 is active on the long diagonal
3. I should improve my king's safety

Among the legal moves, I see several strong options:
- e8d7 would move my king away from the e-file and improve safety
- e5g4 would reposition my knight to attack White's kingside
- h5g4 would reposition my bishop to a safer square while maintaining diagonal control

After evaluation, I believe the best move is to improve my king's position.

I also see my knight on c4 has multiple options, including the possibility of a fork with c4e5 or c4e3 depending on White's pieces.

Given the position, I'll move my bishop to f3, which increases my control of the center and puts pressure on White's position.

I'll analyze the position as Black:

I see I have my king on d7, bishops on b7 and f8, a knight on c4, a rook on g8, and several pawns. White has bishops on a3 and g2, rooks on b1 and h1, and the king on f1.

Looking at my options, I notice my knight on c4 has several strong possibilities. The move b7e4 (bishop to e4) looks particularly strong as it would attack White's position. The knight on c4 also has good outposts at e3 or e5.

After careful consideration, I'll move my bishop to e4, which creates a strong diagonal threat and increases my control of the center.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

After analyzing the position, I see I'm playing as Black with my king on d7. I have both bishops (on e4 and f8), a knight on c4, and a rook on g8. The position appears to be in the middlegame or early endgame.

Looking at my options, I notice several strong possibilities:

1. I can develop my bishop on e4 to more active squares
2. I can improve my knight on c4
3. I can move my king to a safer square
4. I can advance pawns to create space

The bishop on e4 is particularly powerful, controlling the a8-h1 diagonal. Moving it to f3 would attack White's king on f1 and put pressure on White's position.

I'll make this move:

Looking at my options, I see several strong possibilities:
1. The bishop on f3 has several good diagonal moves
2. My knight on c4 is active and has many options
3. I could develop my king to safety

One particularly strong move is f3d1, which would attack White's rook on b1 with my bishop. This would either win material or force White to move the rook.

After analyzing the position and my available moves, I can see I'm playing as Black with my king on d7. I have a knight on c4 that has several active options, and my bishops are on a8 and f8.

I'll choose to develop my knight to e5, which puts it in a strong central position, attacks the pawn on f3, and increases my control of the center.

I'm playing as Black, and I notice:
- I have a knight on e5 that's quite active
- My king is on d7
- I have two bishops on a8 and f8, and a rook on g8
- White has a pawn on f5 that my knight could potentially capture

Looking at my options, I see several strong moves:

1. The knight on e5 has multiple good options (e5xf3, e5xc4, e5xg4)
2. I could develop my bishop from a8
3. I could improve my king position

The knight on e5 is my most active piece, and capturing on f3 looks particularly strong as it attacks White's bishop on g2.

I need to analyze the position carefully to make the best move.

Looking at the board:
- I'm playing as Black with my king on d7
- White has two rooks (h3 and e1), two bishops (f3 and g1), and a king on f2
- I have two bishops (a8 and f8) and a rook on g8
- The pawn structure is important to consider

Some key observations:
- My king is somewhat exposed in the center
- I should consider improving my piece activity or king safety

Among my options:
- King moves like d7e8 would improve king safety
- Bishop moves like a8b7, a8c6, or a8d5 would activate my light-squared bishop
- Pawn advances could create space or prepare future plans

After evaluation, I believe improving my king safety is a priority, so I'll move my king to e8.

Looking at the current position and my legal moves, I need to make a careful decision:

1. White has a rook on e4 attacking my e-pawn
2. White also has a rook on h3 and bishops on f3 and g1
3. My king is on e8 with limited mobility

The most pressing issue is the attack on my e7 pawn. I should either defend it or make a more urgent move if there's a tactical opportunity.

I notice my bishop on a8 can capture White's rook on e4, which would be a very strong move - trading a bishop for a rook is generally favorable.

- I have a bishop on e4 that's very active
- White has rooks on h3 and h5, and a king on f2

The most pressing issue is the white rook on e5 attacking my e7 pawn. I also need to consider improving my position and potentially using my active bishop on e4.

Looking at my options, I see that my bishop on e4 has many possible moves, but I should use it wisely. Moving e7-e6 would defend the pawn under attack while developing my position.

- Rook on g8
- Several pawns

Looking at the board, I notice my bishop on e4 is very active and is currently attacking White's h1 square. It also appears that White has a rook on h8 that could be captured.

Among my strongest moves:
1. The bishop on e4 has many options, including capturing on h1 (e4h1)
2. Moving my king to safety
3. Developing my bishop on f8

After careful consideration, I'll capture the white rook on h8 with my bishop:

Player_Black (to Proxy):

I can see that I have only three legal moves available as Black:
1. e8d8 - Moving my king from e8 to d8
2. e8d7 - Moving my king from e8 to d7
3. f8e7 - Moving my bishop from f8 to e7

Looking at the position, I notice that I'm in a difficult situation. There's a white rook on e5 that's attacking my position, and another white rook on h6. My king is currently on e8, and I need to move it to safety.

The move f8e7 (moving my bishop) would leave my king in check from the rook on e5, so that's not viable.

Between the two king moves, e8d7 seems more active and gives my king slightly more mobility than e8d8. Moving to d7 also keeps my king closer to the center of the board.

I need to analyze this position carefully. I'm playing as Black and I see several key elements:

1. Material: I have a king, two bishops, a rook, and some pawns. White has a king, two bishops, two rooks, and some pawns.
2. King safety: My king is on d7, and White has a rook on e5 that could be threatening.
3. Piece activity: I have a bishop on f8 and h1, and a rook on g8.

Looking at my legal moves, I notice I can improve my position in several ways. The bishop on h1 has a powerful diagonal and can move to several squares. Moving my bishop from f8 could also develop my position.

After analyzing the options, I'll move my bishop from h1 to capture White's rook on e4, which will remove a dangerous piece and gain material.

I notice my bishop on e4 is particularly active and can make several strong moves. Taking the bishop on g2 would be a good option as it captures a piece and maintains my bishop's activity.

4. White has a rook on e5 that's quite active

Looking at my options, the bishop on g2 is particularly powerful and could be used for a strong move. I could threaten White's king with g2e4, creating a check. This would force White to respond to the check and potentially give me initiative.

- I have two bishops (on f8 and e4) and a rook on g8
- White has a rook on e5 that's attacking my e-file bishop
- White also has a bishop on f6 that's controlling important squares

The bishop on e4 is under attack by White's rook on e5, but it's also a very powerful piece controlling the diagonal. I could move it to safety while maintaining its influence.

My bishop on e4 is particularly strong, controlling the long diagonal and pinning White's king on e1 to the h1 corner. Moving it to f3 would maintain the pin while getting out of the rook's attack.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Let me analyze the position and my available moves:

I see that I'm playing as Black and have several pieces including my king on d7, a rook on f8, a bishop on h1, and pawns on a7, g7, and h7. White has a dangerous rook on e5 and another on h6, plus bishops on g7 and g1.

Key considerations:
1. My king on d7 seems relatively safe for now
2. The white rook on e5 is threatening my position
3. My bishop on h1 has good diagonal control
4. I should look for either defensive moves or counterattacks

Among my options:
- Moving my bishop on h1 to create threats (h1d5, h1e4, etc.)
- Moving my king to safety (d7c7, d7d8, etc.)
- Moving my rook on f8 to a better position
- Advancing pawns for development

The move h1e4 looks particularly strong as it attacks the white rook on e5 with my bishop. This would force White to either move the rook or defend it, giving me tactical initiative.

2. White has two rooks (e5 and h6) and two bishops (g7 and h1)
3. I have two bishops (f8 and e4) and a rook (g8)
4. Material is roughly even, but I need to be careful about my king safety

The bishop on e4 is very active and attacking White's rook on h1. I also notice my bishop on f8 is protecting the g7 pawn.

Among my options:
- Moving my king to safety (d7-c7 or d7-d8)
- Capturing the rook with e4xh1
- Moving my bishop on f8
- Advancing my pawns

The most forcing move is to capture the rook with e4xh1, which wins material. This is clearly the best option.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

I can see all my legal moves now. Let me analyze the position:

1. White has a rook on e5 and h6, and bishops on g7 and g1
2. My king is on d7, and I have rooks on f8 and h1, a bishop on h1, and pawns on a7, g7, and h7
3. White's king is on d3

Looking at the position, I notice my bishop on h1 has an excellent diagonal and can attack White's position. Moving it to e4 would put pressure on White's position and attack the rook on e5.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

I need to analyze this position carefully. I'm playing as Black and have several options.

Key observations:
- I have a king on d7
- I have two bishops (f8 and e4) and a rook (g8)
- White has a dangerous rook on e5 and another on h6
- My e4 bishop is very active and has multiple attacking options

The e4 bishop is particularly powerful, with potential threats against White's position. Looking at the legal moves, I can see that my bishop can attack several squares including h1, which might be a checkmate threat.

Let me check if e4h1 is indeed a checkmate:
- My bishop would attack White's king on d3
- White's king appears to be on d3 with no escape squares
- This looks like a checkmate opportunity

I'll make this move:

I need to carefully evaluate the position. I see that:

2. White has two bishops (on b2 and g3), two rooks (on e5 and h6), and a king on d3
3. I have two rooks (on f8 and h1), a bishop on h8, and several pawns

Looking at the legal moves, I notice I have a bishop on h1 that has excellent mobility along the a8-h1 diagonal. This bishop can potentially deliver a powerful check or capture.

The move h1e4 looks particularly strong as it attacks White's rook on e5 while also putting pressure on the position. This forces White to either move the rook or defend it, giving me the initiative.

d7c8,d7d6,d7c6,f8e7

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

I can see that I'm playing as Black and I have a few options. Let me analyze the position:

I'm in a difficult position with my king on d7. White has a rook on e5 that's currently checking my king. I have only four legal moves:
- d7c8: Move my king to c8
- d7d6: Move my king to d6
- d7c6: Move my king to c6
- f8e7: Move my bishop from f8 to e7

Looking at the board, I notice that:
- Moving my king to d6 would put me in the path of the white bishop on g3
- Moving to c6 would expose me to the bishop on b2
- Moving to c8 seems safer but still vulnerable

The best move appears to be f8e7, which blocks the check from the rook on e5 with my bishop. This defends against the immediate threat while developing my bishop to a more active square.

I notice my bishop on e4 is very active and has several strong diagonal moves available. I also see that my king is relatively exposed.

I'll play the strong bishop move:

make_move e4f3

This move attacks White's king directly, putting it in check. This forces White to respond to the check and gives me the initiative. The bishop on f3 also controls important squares and maintains pressure in White's position.

- I could move my bishop on f3 to create threats
- I could improve my rook position on g8
- I could advance my king from d7

The bishop on f3 is particularly active and can potentially create threats. Moving it to e4 would put pressure on white's position and control important central squares.

After analyzing the position, I see several strong options. I notice I have two bishops - one on e7 and one on e4, with the e4 bishop having many diagonal moves available. My king is on d7, and I have a rook on g8.

The e4 bishop is particularly active and could potentially create threats. I also see that White's king is on d3 with limited protection.

I'll play the bishop move e4f3, which attacks White's position and maintains control of important diagonals. This move puts pressure on White's position while maintaining my piece activity.

I notice several important features:
- I have a bishop on d1 that's actively placed deep in White's territory
- I have a bishop on e7 that controls important diagonals
- My king on d7 seems relatively safe
- White has a rook on b5 that could be threatening

Looking at my legal moves, I see several strong options:

1. Moving my bishop on d1 could create threats or improve its position
2. Developing my rook on g8 to a more active square
3. Improving my king position

The move `d1h5` looks particularly strong as it attacks White's pawn on h5 while maintaining the bishop's activity. This would put pressure on White's kingside.

- My king is on d7
- I have two bishops (e7 and h5) and a rook on g8
- White has a rook on a5 that's currently attacking my a-pawn
- White's king is on d3

Looking at my options, I notice my bishop on h5 has a long diagonal and could potentially be dangerous. My rook on g8 is also well-positioned on an open file.

The move that stands out is moving my bishop from h5 to e2, which would put White's king in check and create a strong threat:

- Bishops on e7 and e2
- A rook on g8

White has a rook on a4 that's potentially threatening my position.

Looking at my options, I notice my bishop on e2 has several strong moves available. This bishop is deep in White's territory and can be a powerful piece. I also need to consider my king's safety and potential threats.

The move e2f3 with my bishop looks particularly strong - it attacks White's position while maintaining control of important squares. This diagonal is powerful for my bishop.

- My bishop on f3 has several good diagonal options

You are a professional chess player and you play as black. Now is your turn to make a move. Before making a move you can pick one of the following actions:
- 'get_current_board' to get the schema and current status of the board
- 'get_legal_moves' to get a UCI formatted list of available moves
- 'make_move <UCI formatted move>' when you are ready to complete your turn (e.g., 'make_move e2e4')

I need to carefully analyze this position. I'm playing as Black and I see several key elements:

1. Material: I have a king, two bishops, a rook, and some pawns. White has a king, a rook, a bishop, and some pawns.
2. My king is on d7, and I have a bishop on e7 and h1, and a rook on g8.
3. There appears to be a White rook on d4 that could be threatening my position.

Looking at my options, I notice my bishop on h1 has some strong diagonal moves available. In particular, the move h1d5 looks very strong as it attacks White's rook on d4. This would create a direct threat and force White to respond.

2. King safety: My king is on d7, White's king is on d3
3. Pawn structure: There are several pawns on both sides

Looking at my legal moves, I notice I have a bishop on d5 with many diagonal options. This bishop is very powerful, controlling multiple diagonals. I also see my other bishop on e7 and rook on g8.

The most promising move appears to be using my bishop on d5 to attack White's position. In particular, the move d5f3 looks strong as it attacks the area near White's king while maintaining control of important diagonals.

4. White's king is on e5

I notice my bishop on f3 is very active and controls important diagonals. I should consider using it to attack or improve my position.

Looking at the legal moves, I see that I can attack White's king with my bishop from f3 by moving to g4, creating a check.

You are a professional chess player and you play as black. Now is your turn to make a move. Before making a move you can pick one of the following actions:
- 'get_current_board' to get the schema and current status of the board
- 'get_legal_moves' to get a UCI formatted list of available moves
- 'make_move <UCI formatted move>' when you are ready to complete your turn (e.g., 'make_move e2e4')

I'll analyze the position:

1. I'm playing as Black with my king on d7
2. Material count: I have a rook on g8, two bishops (e7 and g4), and some pawns
3. White has a bishop on b4, king on e5, and some pawns

Looking at my options:
- I have a bishop on g4 that's attacking diagonally and could potentially create threats
- My rook on g8 has mobility along the g-file
- I need to be careful about my king's safety

One of my strongest moves appears to be moving my bishop from g4 to e6, which attacks White's king on e5. This creates a direct check and forces White to respond.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

I need to analyze this position carefully. 

I see that I'm playing as Black with my king on d7, and I have two bishops (on e7 and e6) and three pawns (a7, g6, g7). White has a king on e5, a bishop on b4, a knight on g7, and three pawns (a4, b4, d4).

Looking at my options, I notice several strong moves with my bishops. The bishop on e6 has particularly good mobility and could be used for an attack. The bishop on e7 is also well-positioned.

Since White's king is on e5, I can consider moves that put pressure on it or improve my position. The move e6d5 looks particularly strong as it attacks White's king directly while being protected by my other bishop on e7.

I notice my bishop on d5 has many strong diagonal moves available. It's currently attacking White's bishop on b4, and I could also develop an attack on White's king with d5f3.

The move d5f3 looks particularly strong as it puts White's king in check while developing my piece to a more active position.

I notice several strong options:
1. My bishop on f3 is very active and can attack in multiple directions
2. The bishop on e7 is also well positioned

The most powerful move appears to be attacking White's king with my bishop:
- f3e4 would put White's king in check and threaten the d4 pawn

This is a very strong move that forces White to respond to the check while also threatening material.

2. I could develop my king to improve its position.
3. I have pawn moves available.

The most promising move appears to be d5f3, which would attack White's king on e5 with my bishop. This puts immediate pressure on White and forces a response.

I can see the current board position. I'm playing as Black, and I notice I have a bishop on f3, my king is on d6, and I have pawns on a7, g7, and g6. White has a knight on g8, a bishop on d4, the king on e5, and pawns on a4, b4, and e5.

Let me check what legal moves I have available.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Thank you for providing the legal moves. Let me analyze the position and make a decision.

I notice several important features of this position:
1. My bishop on f3 is very active and controls several key squares
2. White's knight on g8 is somewhat out of play
3. My king on d6 (based on the board) has several possible moves
4. I have the opportunity to attack White's bishop on d4 with my king

Looking at the legal moves, I see that "d7d6" is listed, which suggests my king is actually on d7 (not d6 as I initially thought from the board visualization).

One of my strongest moves appears to be moving my bishop to attack White's king with "f3e4", which puts White in check and applies pressure.

I need to analyze the position carefully:

1. I'm playing as Black with my king on d7
2. White has a king on e5, a bishop on d4, and a knight on g7
3. I have a bishop on e4 which is attacking diagonally
4. There are several pawns for both sides

Looking at the position, I notice my bishop on e4 is very powerful with many options. One particularly strong move is to capture White's bishop on d4, which would eliminate a dangerous piece and improve my position.

I see the issue now. Looking at the legal moves and the board position, I can see that the bishop on e4 is actually my piece (black bishop), and the bishop on d4 is white's piece. 

Among my options, capturing the white bishop with my bishop seems strong:

Player_Black (to Proxy):

I see the available moves. Let me analyze this position:

I'm playing as Black, and I have a bishop on d7, my king on d8, and pawns on a7, g7, and e5. White has a king on e5, a knight on f6, a bishop on d4, and pawns on a6, b4, and e7.

The most critical observation is that White's knight on f6 is attacking my g7 pawn. I need to decide whether to defend this pawn or focus on other priorities.

Looking at my bishop on d7, I notice it's currently pinning White's king to the e7 pawn. If I move my bishop along this diagonal (to either c8 or e6), I maintain this pin. Moving to e6 would be more active and also attack the knight on f6.

The move d7e6 looks strongest because:
1. It maintains the pin on White's king to the e7 pawn
2. It attacks White's knight on f6
3. It develops my bishop to a more active square

1. I'm playing as Black with my king on e6 and a bishop on d3
2. White has a king on e5, a knight on d4, a bishop on d4, and several pawns
3. I have a potential checkmate opportunity

The move d3e4 stands out as it delivers checkmate. My bishop on d3 can move to e4, which puts the White king in check with no legal moves:
- The king can't capture the bishop because it would be protected by my king on e6
- The king can't move to d5 or f5 because my king controls those squares
- The king can't move to d6 or f6 because those squares are attacked by my bishop
- No White piece can block or capture the bishop

1. My king is on e6

4. White has a king on d3, a bishop on e5, a knight on d7, and pawns on a6, b4, and e7

Looking at my legal moves, I notice several key options:
- I can move my king in various directions
- I have multiple bishop moves
- I can advance my g-pawn

The most critical factor is my king's safety. I notice White's bishop on e5 is attacking my king's diagonal. My bishop on d5 is currently pinning White's bishop to their king on d3. If I move my bishop, White's bishop would attack my king.

The strongest move appears to be capturing White's pawn with my king: e6f7. This removes a white pawn, improves my king position, and maintains the pin on White's bishop.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

I can see that I'm playing as Black with my king on f7, and I have only four legal moves available. Let me analyze the position:

- White has a knight on e5, a bishop on f6, and the king on d3
- I have a bishop on f3 which is attacking the white king
- White's bishop on f6 is attacking my king
- White's knight on e5 is also controlling squares around my king

Looking at my options:
- f7g8: Moving my king to g8
- f7e8: Moving my king to e8
- f7f6: Moving my king to f6, capturing White's bishop
- f7e6: Moving my king to e6

The best move appears to be capturing the bishop on f6, which removes an attacker and gives me material advantage. The knight on e5 doesn't directly attack f6, so this capture is safe.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

I need to analyze this position carefully as Black.

Looking at the board:
- I have a king on f6, a bishop on f3, and pawns on a7, g7, and a6
- White has a king on d3, a knight on e5, a rook on e8, and pawns on a6, b4

The most critical aspects of this position:
1. My bishop on f3 is very powerful and active
2. White's knight on e5 is threatening my king
3. White's rook on e8 is also dangerous

Among my legal moves, I should prioritize safety for my king while maintaining my bishop's activity. The knight on e5 is a direct threat that needs to be addressed.

I'll capture the knight with my bishop, which removes the immediate threat to my king and maintains my bishop as an active piece.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

I see I have only two legal moves available:

1. f6g5 - Moving my king from f6 to g5
2. g6g5 - Moving my pawn from g6 to g5

Let me analyze the position:

If I play g6g5, I would be moving my pawn forward, but this would leave my king exposed to the white knight on e5, which could potentially lead to a check or worse.

If I play f6g5, I would be moving my king to g5. This seems safer as it moves my king away from the white knight's attack range and closer to my pawns for protection.

I'll choose to move my king:

I can see all my legal moves now. Since White has played a3, which doesn't control the center or develop a piece, I should follow good opening principles:

1. Control the center
2. Develop pieces
3. Ensure king safety

One of the strongest first moves for Black is e7-e5, claiming central space. This is a classical response that fights for the center immediately and opens lines for the bishop and queen.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

I can see we have a standard opening position where I'm playing as Black. White has played some kingside fianchetto moves (f3, g3) and developed pieces on the queenside.

Looking at my position, I notice I have the opportunity to castle kingside with "e8g8" which is a strong move that would secure my king's safety. This is typically a priority in the opening phase.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

After analyzing the position, I can see I'm playing as Black and have a standard development with knights on c6 and f6, bishops on c8 and e7, and I've pushed my e-pawn to e5.

I notice White has developed a knight to c3 and pushed pawns to f3 and g3, creating a fianchetto-like structure on the kingside. My king has castled kingside.

Looking at my options, developing my pieces further would be good. The bishop on c8 needs development, and I could consider castling queenside with the rook on a8.

I think a strong move would be to develop my light-squared bishop:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

I'll analyze the position to make the best move as Black.

I notice this is a Sicilian Defense structure where both sides have castled kingside. White has a pawn on a4 and has played f3-g4, creating a kingside pawn structure. Black has a strong center with pawns on d5 and e5.

Looking at my options:
- I have knights on c6 and f6 that could be developed to better squares
- My dark-squared bishop on c8 could be developed
- I could strengthen my center with moves like e5-e4

The knight on f6 has some good outposts, particularly e4 which would be a strong central square. Moving to e4 would put pressure on White's position and potentially threaten the pawn on g3.

I'll make this move:

The knight on e4 is particularly strong, controlling key central squares. I'll castle kingside to ensure my king's safety, which is a priority in this middlegame position.

One of my strongest options appears to be developing my bishop on c8, which is currently undeveloped. The diagonal to f5 looks particularly good as it controls important central squares.

After analyzing the position and available moves, I see I have several strong options. 

I notice I have two knights on d4 and e4 that are well-positioned, and two bishops on e7 and f5 that are active. My queen is on d8, and I have some pawn structure issues to consider.

One of the strongest moves appears to be developing my bishop on f5 to g6, which maintains control of key central squares while improving my piece coordination.

One particularly strong move is to activate my bishop on e7 by moving it to g5, which would pin White's knight on f6 to their queen. This would create a tactical threat.

I notice my knights are well-positioned on d4 and e4, putting pressure on White's position. I also have two bishops aimed at the kingside. My king is currently on g8 with the rook on f8, so castling has already happened.

One of the strongest moves appears to be developing my dark-squared bishop with g5e7, which develops a piece while threatening White's queen. This would force White to move the queen and give me the initiative.

The most striking feature is that I have two knights on d4 and e4 that are well-positioned in the center, plus a bishop on e7 that could develop an attack. I also notice my opponent has a bishop on d7 that's threatening my position.

One of the strongest moves appears to be:

make_move e4f2

This knight move to f2 creates a fork, attacking the white king on e1 and the rook on h1 simultaneously. This is a powerful tactic that will either win material or force the king to move, giving up castling rights. Since the knight is protected by my other knight on d4, this creates a very strong tactical threat.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

After analyzing the position and my legal moves, I can see several key factors:

1. I have two knights that can make active moves (g6 and e2)
2. My king on g8 is relatively safe
3. I have a bishop on e7 with several potential moves
4. My pawn structure is mostly intact

Looking at the position more deeply, I notice my knight on e2 is very well placed and threatening the white queen. I should capitalize on this tactical opportunity.

After analyzing the position and available moves, I see several interesting options:

1. I have a bishop on e7 that can capture a knight on g5 with `e7g5`
2. My knight on g6 can capture a pawn on e5 with `g6e4`
3. I have a rook on f8 that could move to e8 with `f8e8`
4. My knight on c3 has several options including `c3e4`

Looking at the position more carefully, I notice that my knight on g6 can capture the pawn on e5 with check, which seems like a strong move. This would attack the white king on e1 while gaining material.

The knight on g4 is particularly active and can create threats. I also see that my bishop on e5 is attacking the white queen on e2. 

One of the strongest moves appears to be Ng4-e3, which forks the white queen and rook on h1. This would force White to either lose the queen or the rook.

One particularly strong move I see is to use my knight on e3 to attack White's queen while simultaneously threatening the rook on h1:

- I have a pawn on e4 that could advance or capture

Looking at tactical opportunities, I see that my bishop on e7 has a powerful diagonal. Moving it to g5 would attack White's h-pawn while developing the piece to a more active square.

I'll make this move:

Player_Black (to Proxy):

I need to analyze this position carefully. 

I notice I'm playing as Black and have several pieces under attack:
- My bishop on e4 is attacked by the white pawn on f3
- My pawn on d5 could be captured

Looking at the position, I see opportunities:
- My queen on d8 has many options
- I have knights on e2 and g2 that could develop
- My king on g8 seems relatively safe with a rook on f8

After evaluating the position, I'll protect my bishop on e4 by moving it to f5, which also puts pressure on White's position.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

After analyzing the position and my available moves, I see several key factors:

1. My king is on g8 with a rook on f8, and I have a queen on d8
2. White's queen is on a6, which is attacking my a-pawn
3. I have a bishop on f5 with several good options
4. I have knights on e2 and g2 that can be developed

The move that stands out is:

make_move f5g4

This move attacks White's f3 pawn while developing my bishop to a more active square. It creates a threat that White must respond to, and improves my piece coordination. The bishop on g4 will put pressure on White's kingside and potentially pin pieces against the queen.

Let me analyze the position and make the best move for Black.

I notice several important features:
- I have two knights on e2 and g2, with my king on g7
- White has a queen on b7 which is threatening my position
- I have a bishop on g4 that appears to be active
- My queen on d8 has several options

Looking at the legal moves, I see some tactical opportunities. The bishop on g4 has several diagonal moves that could be threatening. Also, my queen has mobility.

After careful consideration, I believe the strongest move is to attack White's queen with my pawn:

Looking at the position, I see that my king on g8 is somewhat exposed with the white rook on h4. I should prioritize safety and development.

One of the strongest moves appears to be moving my bishop on g4 to capture the bishop on d7, which would eliminate a powerful piece and strengthen my position.

Given the queen threat on my a-pawn and the tactical opportunity, I'll play:

make_move c3d5

After analyzing the position and available moves, I see several tactical opportunities. 

The most striking feature is that I have two knights (on d4 and e3) that can create threats, and my queen on d8 is active. I also notice my bishop on d7 can develop.

One of the strongest moves appears to be:

make_move e3f5

This knight move attacks White's rook on h4 while also creating a potential fork threat against White's pieces. It puts immediate pressure on my opponent and forces a response to the rook threat, giving me the initiative.

Looking at the position, I see a strong tactical opportunity with my queen on h4. The white king appears to be on g7, and there's a potential checkmate or strong attack.

I'll make a powerful move with my queen to attack the white king:

After analyzing the position, I can see I have several strong options as Black. I notice my queen is on e3 with many potential moves, and I have knights on d5 and f5 that could create threats.

Looking at the position, I see that my queen on e3 is attacking along the e-file and could potentially create threats. I also have a rook on f8 that could be developed further.

One particularly strong move appears to be moving my queen to f2, which would create a powerful threat against White's king on h1 while maintaining control of key squares.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

After analyzing the position, I can see I'm playing as Black and have several interesting options. 

The position is quite complex with my king on h8 and a rook on f8. I notice I have two knights (on d5 and f5) that have multiple active squares. 

Looking at the threats and opportunities:

1. My rook on f8 is protecting the f7 pawn but could be more active elsewhere
2. I have two knights that can make tactical moves
3. The e5 pawn could advance to e4 to gain space

The strongest move appears to be advancing my e-pawn with e5-e4, which would gain space in the center and potentially create threats against White's position.

After analyzing the position, I can see I'm playing as Black and have several options. Let me evaluate the key aspects:

1. Material: I appear to have a queen advantage (I see a black rook on f8 and white queen on b8)
2. King safety: My king is on g8 with some pawn protection
3. Piece activity: I have knights on d5 and f5, a bishop on d7, and a rook on f8

Looking at my legal moves, I need to prioritize safety while maintaining my advantage. The move f5g3 (knight from f5 to g3) looks particularly strong as it:
1. Attacks the white king on g1
2. Creates a fork threat against multiple pieces
3. Increases my piece activity in White's territory

Player_Black (to Proxy):

I see all my legal moves now. As Black responding to e4, I have several strong options. The most principled responses are:

1. e7e5 - directly contesting the center (King's Pawn Game)
2. c7c5 - the Sicilian Defense, an aggressive counter-attacking option
3. e7e6 - the French Defense, solid but slightly passive
4. c7c6 - the Caro-Kann Defense, solid and reliable
5. d7d5 - the Scandinavian Defense, immediately challenging White's pawn

As a professional player, I'll choose the Sicilian Defense with c7c5, which is statistically one of Black's most successful responses to e4. It creates asymmetrical pawn structures and gives Black good fighting chances.

Let me check what legal moves I have available.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Now I can see all my legal moves. Let me analyze the position and make a strategic decision:

1. My knight on c6 is pinned by White's bishop on b5. I should address this.
2. White has control of the center with e4.
3. I need to continue development and ensure king safety.

Among my options:
- a6 would attack the bishop on b5, forcing it to retreat or capture my knight
- e6 would develop toward controlling the center
- e5 would challenge White's central pawn
- Developing pieces like Qb6 or Qa5 could put pressure on White's position

I think the most principled move is to challenge the bishop with a6, which will either force it to retreat or commit to an exchange.

You are a professional chess player and you play as black. Now is your turn to make a move. Before making a move you can pick one of the following actions:
- 'get_current_board' to get the schema and current status of the board
- 'get_legal_moves' to get a UCI formatted list of available moves
- 'make_move <UCI formatted move>' when you are ready to complete your turn (e.g., 'make_move e2e4')

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

I see the current position and my available moves. Looking at the board:

1. White has developed a bishop to b4, a knight to f3, and pushed the e-pawn to e4
2. As Black, I've developed my knight to f6 and have pawns on a6 and c5

This appears to be a Sicilian Defense structure. I should continue development and secure my king's position.

The most principled move here is to develop my knight from b8 to c6, which develops a piece, controls the center, and follows opening principles.

I'll analyze the position:

White has developed a bishop to b4, a knight to f3, and pushed pawns to d4 and e4. I need to continue my development and respond to White's center control.

Looking at my options, I notice I can develop my queen's bishop with d8b6, which would pin White's f2 pawn to the king. This is a strong developing move that also creates a tactical threat.

I could also develop my knight on c6 to e5, which would attack White's bishop on b4 and put pressure on the center.

After consideration, I'll develop my bishop with a pin:

After analyzing the position and available moves, I can see I have several options. 

I notice my knight on f2 is attacking White's queen on d1, but it's not a capture because the queen is on d1 and my knight can't reach there directly. However, I can improve my position.

The knight on f2 is well-placed and can move to e4, which would be a strong central square. This would increase my control of the center and put pressure on White's position.

The knight on e4 is well-placed and active, but it could be even better positioned. Moving it to c3 would attack White's queen on b2 and create a fork with the white king on e1. This is a powerful tactical opportunity.

You are a professional chess player and you play as black. Now is your turn to make a move. Before making a move you can pick one of the following actions:
- 'get_current_board' to get the schema and current status of the board
- 'get_legal_moves' to get a UCI formatted list of available moves
- 'make_move <UCI formatted move>' when you are ready to complete your turn (e.g., 'make_move e2e4')

Looking at the position, I see I'm playing Black and have several options. Let me analyze the situation:

1. My king is on e8 with castling still possible to the kingside (g8h8 is available)
2. White has two bishops on a3 and a4, and a queen on c3 pointing toward my queenside
3. I have knights on c4 and c6 that could be developed better

I'll castle kingside to improve my king's safety, which is a good priority in the middlegame.

2. I have a knight on c4 that could potentially fork pieces
3. My king's position is relatively safe

Looking at my options, I see a strong tactical opportunity with my knight on c4. I can play Nc4e3, which forks White's queen on c3 and threatens the king's position. This is a powerful move that will either win material or create significant threats.

Given these considerations, I'll castle kingside to improve my king's safety:

I need to analyze the position carefully before making my move.

Looking at the board, I notice:
- White has a bishop on c3 that's attacking my queen on b2
- White has a strong central presence with pieces developed
- My king is on e8 and could use some development
- I have a knight on e1 that's quite advanced

Among my options, I see several strong candidates:
- Developing with e7e6 or e7e5 would be solid
- Moving my queen away from the bishop's attack
- Castling with e8d8 (queenside) would improve my king safety

After consideration, I believe the most urgent priority is to protect my queen from the bishop on c3. The queen is my most valuable piece and currently under attack.

This knight move to c2 creates a fork, attacking both the white queen on c3 and the white pawn on a3. This forces White to either move the queen or lose material. It's a tactical opportunity that should give me an advantage.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

I need to analyze the position carefully. 

I see that I'm playing as Black and have a knight on c2 that's quite active in White's territory. My queen is on c6, and I have a standard kingside castled position. White has a queen on c3 and a bishop on a3, with some pressure along the c-file.

Looking at my options, I notice several strong possibilities:
- I could attack White's queen with my knight by playing c2e3
- I could develop my queen to a more active square
- I could continue developing my other pieces

The knight move c2e3 looks particularly appealing as it attacks White's queen while also threatening the king on e1 (fork). This would force White to move their queen and give me a tempo.

Looking at the position, I see that my knight on e3 is attacking White's king on e1. This is a check opportunity, but I need to verify if e1 is indeed where the king is. Looking at the board again, I see the White king is actually on e2.

One strong move would be to use my knight to fork White's king and another piece. I see that if I play Ne3-c4, I can attack both the White king on e2 and the bishop on a3.

2. My queen on c6 has many potential moves
3. I have a knight on b2 that's quite active in White's territory
4. The pawn structure is relatively intact

Castling would be a good priority to improve my king's safety. Additionally, I notice my queen is well-positioned but could potentially be more active.

After analyzing the position, I'll castle kingside to improve my king's safety:

- White has a queen on a4 and a bishop on b4
- My queen is on c6, which is quite active
- White has a knight on f3 and rooks on b2 and g1

One of my strongest moves appears to be developing my queen's activity. I can threaten White's queen with Qc6-a4, but that would lose my queen. Instead, I should consider either developing my pieces or improving my queen's position.

The move c6e4 looks particularly strong - it moves my queen to e4, attacking White's king on e1 and potentially creating threats.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

I need to analyze this position carefully. I'm playing as Black and I notice:

1. My queen on e4 is under attack by White's bishop on b4
2. I have my king on e8 with pieces around it
3. White has a queen on a4 and a knight on f3

The most pressing issue is my queen being attacked. I should either move it to safety or capture something valuable with it.

Looking at my queen's options, I see several interesting possibilities:
- e4f3: Capturing White's knight
- e4d3: Attacking White's position
- e4e5: Moving to safety while controlling the center

The best move appears to be capturing the knight on f3, which removes a White piece and improves my position.

I need to analyze the position carefully before making my move. 

I notice several important features:
- White has a queen on a4 and a bishop on b4 threatening my queenside
- My queen is on f3, actively placed in White's territory
- White has a pawn on c3 that could be vulnerable
- My king is on e8 with limited development

Looking at the legal moves, I have several strong options with my queen. I could attack White's king with f3f1, but that would likely lose my queen to White's rook on f1. 

One of the strongest moves appears to be using my queen to capture the undefended pawn on c3, which would also attack White's bishop on b4.

After analyzing the position, I can see I'm playing as Black and have several options. I notice my queen is on c3, which is quite active and threatening White's position. I also see that White has a queen on a4 and a bishop on b4, which could be threatening.

Looking at my options, I see a strong move would be to attack White's king with my queen while also maintaining control of key squares.

I'll play:

make_move c3e3

This move:
1. Attacks White's king on e2 directly
2. Maintains control of the c-file
3. Keeps my queen active and flexible
4. Forces White to respond to the check

- My queen is on e3, with many possible moves
- White has a queen on a4 and a bishop on b4
- I have an uncastled king on e8

Looking at the position, I see a strong opportunity with my queen on e3. I can attack White's king on f1 while also threatening the rook on g1.

Among my legal moves, I should prioritize development and king safety. The move e7-e5 stands out as it:
1. Controls the center
2. Opens lines for my bishop on f8 and queen
3. Follows good opening principles

- White's queen on a4 is threatening my b-pawn
- I have an advanced pawn on e5 that could be vulnerable

Given the position, I should prioritize king safety and development. The bishop on f8 can be developed to improve my position.

I'll develop my bishop to e7, which helps protect my king and prepares for potential castling on the kingside.

Given the position, I see that my e5 pawn is under attack by White's rook on f4. I should address this threat. I also notice my bishop on g5 has good mobility.

One strong move would be to protect the e5 pawn with `f7f6`, which also opens up the f7 square for potential king safety.

Another good option is to move the bishop to a safer and more active position like `g5e7`, which develops the bishop toward the center and maintains control of important squares.

After consideration, I'll choose:

make_move g5e7

Looking at the position, I notice several important factors:
- White has a rook on f4 attacking my e-pawn
- White's queen is on a4, which could be dangerous
- My king is in the center and might need protection

Among my legal moves, I see a few priorities:
- Protect the attacked e5 pawn
- Continue development
- Improve king safety

After analyzing the position, I'll make a move:

make_move e8f8

This move improves my king's safety by moving it away from the center and toward the kingside where I can potentially castle by hand (moving the rook next to the king manually since the automatic castling right may be gone). This is a solid defensive move that addresses one of my key concerns in the position.

One strong move would be to develop my bishop from e7 to f6, which protects my e5 pawn and improves my piece activity. This also indirectly defends the f7 pawn.

One strong move would be to activate my rook by connecting them with:

make_move f8e8

This move:
1. Connects my rooks
2. Improves my king's position
3. Maintains control of the e-file

Player_Black (to Proxy):

After analyzing the position, I can see I'm playing as Black and I'm in a challenging situation. White has a queen on a3 and a rook on f4 attacking my e-pawn. I need to respond to these threats.

Looking at my options, I notice several key considerations:
1. My king's safety is important
2. I need to address the attack on my e5 pawn
3. I should develop my pieces and improve my position

One of my strongest moves would be to develop my bishop with tempo by playing Bf5, which develops a piece while indirectly defending the e5 pawn by creating a tactical threat.

The most principled move here appears to be completing my kingside castle, which would improve my king safety and connect my rooks.

2. I have a bishop on f5 with several good diagonal moves
3. White has a queen on a4 which could be threatening

The kingside castle looks particularly appealing as it would improve my king safety and connect my rooks. This is typically a priority in the middlegame.

1. I'm playing as Black and my king is on e8
2. White has a queen on b2 threatening my position
3. I have a bishop on f5 that's active
4. The pawn structure is somewhat compromised

Looking at the legal moves, I need to prioritize king safety and development. The white queen on b2 is a concern, but doesn't appear to be delivering an immediate check.

One strong move would be to castle kingside, which would improve my king safety and connect my rooks:

After analyzing the position and my legal moves, I notice several important factors:

1. I have a bishop on f5 with many potential moves
2. My king is on e8 with the option to castle kingside (e8g8)
3. My pawn structure is relatively intact
4. White has a queen on b5 that could be threatening

Given the position, I believe castling kingside would be a strong move. This will improve my king safety and connect my rooks, which is a key strategic goal in the middlegame.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

I apologize for the confusion. It seems I misinterpreted the castling notation. In UCI format, kingside castling for Black is denoted as "e8g8", but there must be an issue with the legality of this move in the current position.

Let me check the board again. It appears I can't castle kingside right now, possibly because there's a piece in the way or the king would pass through a check.

Let me try a different move. Looking at the position, I should develop my pieces and improve my position. The bishop on f5 is already well-placed, so let me consider moving my rook to a more active position.

After analyzing the position, I see several promising options. I notice I have a bishop on f5 with many potential moves, and my king is castled with both rooks still on the board.

Looking at the position more carefully, I see that my bishop on f5 can capture a pawn on e4 if I play e5e4, which would win material. However, I should first check if this is safe.

The pawn on e5 is defended by my pawn on d4, and if I capture with e5e4, White's d-pawn would be pinned against their king. This looks like a strong move that gains material.

I'll analyze the position to make the best move as Black.

I notice I have a bishop on f5 that's actively placed, and my king is on e8 with a rook on each side. White has a bishop on a1, a queen on b1, and a rook on g1. 

Looking at the pawn structure, I have a pawn on e4 that's quite advanced and could be a potential asset. I should consider my king safety and potential threats.

Among my options, I see that I can develop my bishop further with moves like Bf5-c8 or Bf5-g4. I could also advance pawns or move my rooks.

The move Bf5-g4 looks particularly appealing as it puts pressure on White's position and increases my piece activity. This move pins any potential knight that might move to f3 against the queen, and generally improves my bishop's position.

I need to analyze the position carefully. I'm playing as Black, and I notice several important elements:

1. Material is roughly even (I have rooks, a bishop, and pawns)
2. My king is on e8 with a rook on each side (d8 and h8)
3. I have a bishop on g4 that appears to be active
4. White has a queen on e1 and king on f1

Looking at my options, I see that my bishop on g4 has several strong moves. In particular, I notice that Bg4-e6 would attack White's queen while being protected by my pawn on f7. This would create a powerful threat.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

After analyzing the position, I see several good options. I notice my king is on e8 with a rook on d8 and h8, and I have a bishop on e6. White's queen is on f6 which could be threatening.

I think one of the strongest moves here is to develop my rook with:

make_move d8c8

This improves my rook's position, connecting my rooks and preparing for potential counterplay on the c-file. It also moves my rook away from the d-file where it could become pinned or targeted. This is a solid positional improvement that enhances my piece coordination.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

I need to analyze this position carefully. 

I see that I'm playing as Black with my king on e8 and rooks on c8 and h8. I have a bishop on e6. White has a queen on e5 and a rook on g1. The pawn structure is interesting with some exchanges having occurred.

Looking at the legal moves, I need to consider:
1. King safety - my king is somewhat exposed
2. Piece activity
3. Potential threats from White's queen on e5

The bishop on e6 is well-placed, controlling diagonals. My rooks could use better coordination.

I think a solid move would be to connect my rooks with:

make_move h8f8

This improves my rook coordination, maintains protection of the king, and prepares for potential counterplay on the f-file. It's a flexible move that improves my position without committing to any particular plan yet.

Looking at my options, I notice my king is in the center and could benefit from castling for safety. Castling kingside with "f8g8" looks like a good option since my king would be safer and the rook would become more active.

Looking at the legal moves, I should prioritize safety and development. The bishop on g4 is pinning White's queen to their king on f2, which is a powerful tactical motif.

After analyzing the position, I see I have several options. I notice I have a bishop on e2 that's actively attacking the white king on f6, creating a check. I also have my king on e8 and rooks on c8 and g8.

The most powerful move appears to be moving my bishop to create a stronger attack. Looking at the legal moves, I can move the bishop to several squares while maintaining the check.

I'll choose to move the bishop to f3, which maintains the check while positioning it more centrally and safely:

4. My king is on e8 with rooks on c8 and g8

The most critical move I see is with my bishop on h1, which is currently attacking the white king on f3. This is a check opportunity.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

I see all my legal moves now. Let me analyze the position:

I'm playing as Black and have a bishop on f3 that's very active, putting pressure on the white king on f2. This is a powerful piece that I should consider using effectively.

Looking at the position, I notice:
- My bishop on f3 is attacking the white king on f2
- I have a passed pawn on c7 that's already advanced
- The position seems to have material equality but my bishop on f3 gives me tactical opportunities

The most promising move appears to be to increase the pressure with my bishop. Moving it to g2 would create a strong check:

1. I'm playing as Black and have a bishop on g2 that's attacking White's king on e2
2. I have a passed pawn on c7 that's one move away from promotion
3. My king is on e8 with rooks on c8 and g8

Looking at the legal moves, I see a strong move: promoting my c7 pawn.

I apologize for the confusion. Looking at the board again, I see that c7 is actually a white pawn (♙), not a black pawn. I misinterpreted the position.

3. White's king is on f2
4. I have a bishop on c4 that's actively placed
5. White has a rook on d1

Looking at my options, I notice my bishop on c4 has several strong moves. In particular, the move c4e2 looks very strong as it attacks White's king on f2 and the pawn on g4, creating a powerful check.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

I see the current position and my legal moves. Let me analyze the situation:

I'm playing as Black and I have a bishop on f1 which is attacking the white king on f6. This is a check, but White has ways to escape. I need to make a strong move.

Looking at my options, I notice I have a bishop on f1 with several powerful moves. I can either maintain the pressure or try to win material.

The move Bf1-c4 looks particularly strong as it maintains the attack on the white king while also targeting the d3 square and potentially the white rook on d4.

I'll make this move:

I need to analyze the position carefully before making my move.

Looking at the board, I notice:
- I'm playing as Black with my king on e8
- White has a rook on d3 and a bishop on b4
- I have a bishop on g4 that's currently attacking something
- The pawn structure is complex with several advanced pawns

One of the strongest moves I see is to develop my rook with tempo by attacking White's king on f2:

I apologize for the error. Let me check the legal moves again and make a valid move.

Looking at the legal moves list, I see that c8c2 isn't actually legal. Let me choose a strong move from the available options.

The bishop on g4 has several good options. I can use it to create threats or improve its position. Given the position, I'll move my bishop to e6, which protects my d-pawn and controls important central squares:

I'm playing as Black and have several key pieces: two rooks on c8 and g8, a bishop on e6, and my king on e8. The pawn structure is somewhat compromised with White having a passed d-pawn and a bishop on b4.

Looking at my options, I notice a few strategic considerations:
1. My king's safety is important
2. My bishop on e6 is active and could potentially move to a better diagonal
3. I have rooks that could be better positioned

Among my legal moves, I see that I can improve my king's position by moving it to d7, which would connect my rooks and get my king away from the back rank.

Key considerations:

2. The white rook on d3 is potentially threatening my d-pawn
3. I have two rooks that could be better coordinated

Among my options, I see a strong move: connecting my rooks by moving the c8 rook to f8. This improves my piece coordination and maintains control of the 7th rank.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

I need to analyze this position carefully. 

I'm playing as Black and I see that my king is on d7. White's queen is on c3, and White has a rook on d3 that's putting my king in check. I also have two rooks on f8 and g8, and a bishop on e5.

My legal moves are:
- d7c8: Moving my king to c8
- d7e7: Moving my king to e7
- d7d6: Moving my king to d6
- f8c8: Moving my rook from f8 to c8

Since I'm in check from the rook on d3, I need to address this immediately. I have several options:
1. Move my king away (to c8, e7, or d6)
2. Capture the checking piece (not possible here)
3. Block the check (not possible here)

Looking at my king moves:
- d7c8 moves toward the corner but stays on the same rank as White's queen on c3
- d7e7 moves toward my rooks, which could provide protection
- d7d6 moves down the board

The f8c8 move would move my rook to c8, but this doesn't address the check.

I'll choose to move my king to e7, which keeps it protected by my rooks and moves away from White's queen.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Let me analyze the position:

I'm playing as Black and have several pieces: two rooks on f8 and g8, a king on e7, a bishop on e6, and pawns on b7, e4, f7, g7, and h7. White has a queen on c8, a king on f1, a rook on d3, bishops on a4, and pawns on a4, d4, g3, and h2.

Looking at the legal moves, I need to address several concerns:
1. My king's safety is a priority
2. The white queen on c8 is a threat
3. I should consider improving my piece coordination

The move e6d7 (moving my bishop to d7) looks strong as it:
- Protects my king
- Maintains control of important squares
- Prepares to connect my rooks

2. I have two rooks on the back rank (f8 and g8)
3. White has a queen on c8 that's threatening my position
4. I have a bishop on d7 that could develop

Looking at my options, I need to address the queen threat and improve my position. The move Bd7-e6 stands out as it:
- Develops my bishop to a more active square
- Protects my king
- Controls important central squares

I'm playing as Black and have a material advantage with two rooks, a bishop, and several pawns against White's queen, rook, and bishop. My king is on e7, and I need to consider both safety and active play.

Looking at the position, I notice:
1. My bishop on e6 is attacking along the a2-g8 diagonal
2. I have two rooks on the back rank
3. White's queen on c3 could be threatening

One strong move would be to connect my rooks by playing:

I notice my bishop on e6 is well-positioned, controlling the a2-g8 diagonal. My pawn structure is generally solid, though I need to be careful about White's pieces.

One of my strongest moves would be to castle kingside, which would improve my king's safety and connect my rooks. This is a fundamental principle in chess - get your king to safety and connect your rooks when possible.

Looking at my options, I see a few priorities:
- Improve king safety
- Develop my pieces
- Counter any immediate threats

The move e7d8 looks good as it improves my king's position by moving it away from the open e-file and potential threats. This is a natural king move to a safer square.

Looking at my legal moves, I should prioritize safety and development. The queen on c3 is a concern, but doesn't seem to be directly threatening anything critical at the moment.

One strong move would be to connect my rooks with `g8f8`, which improves my king's safety and prepares for potential counterplay on the kingside.

I see that I have only two legal moves as Black:
1. d8e8 - Moving my king from d8 to e8
2. d8c7 - Moving my king from d8 to c7

Looking at the position, I notice that White's queen is on c7, which means d8c7 would be an illegal capture of the queen. This must be a display error in the legal moves list.

The position is quite critical. I have my king on d8 with a white queen on c7 delivering check. I need to move my king, and e8 appears to be the only safe square.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

After analyzing the position and my legal moves, I can see several important factors:

1. White's queen on c7 is threatening my b7 pawn
2. I have my bishop on e5 which could be developed actively
3. My king safety is important to consider

Looking at my options, I think the best move is to develop my bishop to a more active square while potentially creating threats of my own.

I need to analyze this position carefully. 

I see that I'm playing as Black and have a material advantage with a rook and bishop against White's queen. My king is on e8 with rooks on f8 and h8. White's queen is on c7 which is attacking my b7 pawn.

Looking at my legal moves, I notice that my dark-squared bishop on f5 has several options. I should consider both defensive needs and potential threats.

The most critical factor is my king's safety. White's queen on c7 and rook on e5 are active pieces that could threaten me. I should prioritize king safety while maintaining my material advantage.

The move Bg6 (f5g6) looks strong as it protects my king's position, defends the h7 pawn, and maintains control of the diagonal. This bishop placement helps secure my kingside where my king is located.

e8d8,e8f7,f8f7,g6f7

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

I need to carefully analyze this position. I'm playing as Black and I have very limited options.

Current assessment:
- I'm in check from White's queen on f6
- I have only 4 legal moves: e8d8, e8f7, f8f7, or g6f7
- My king is on e8 and I have rooks on f8 and h8, and a bishop on g7
- White has a queen on f6 threatening my king

Let me evaluate each option:
1. e8d8: Moving my king to d8 escapes the check but leaves me vulnerable to further attacks
2. e8f7: Moving my king to f7 puts me right next to the attacking queen - very dangerous
3. f8f7: Blocking with my rook by moving it to f7 would lose the rook to the queen
4. g6f7: Capturing the queen with my pawn would be excellent if possible

The best move is clearly to capture the queen if that's a legal move:

Looking at the current position, I need to make a strategic decision as Black.

I notice that:
- My king is on e8 with rooks on both sides (f8 and h8)
- White has a rook on e5 that's attacking my e-pawn
- I have a bishop on f7 that's currently protecting the e-pawn
- My position is somewhat cramped

Among my options, I should consider improving my king safety. Castling kingside would be a good move here to protect my king and connect my rooks.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

I apologize for the error. It seems I tried to castle using the wrong notation. In UCI format, castling is represented by the king's move from its starting square to its destination square. For kingside castling as Black, that would be e8g8, but it appears this isn't a legal move in the current position.

Let me check the legal moves again and make a proper selection.

From the legal moves list, I see that "h8g8" and "f8g8" are options, which suggests I can move either rook to g8. Since my king is on e8, I'll choose to improve my rook position.

Looking at the position, I notice:
- My king is in the center and could benefit from castling kingside
- I have control of the e-file with my pawn on e4
- My bishop on f7 is well-positioned

Among my options, castling kingside (e8g8) would be a natural move to improve king safety, but it's not in the legal moves list. However, I can move my king toward the kingside with e8f8, which is the next best thing.

- White has a rook on a2 and a bishop on c2
- Material seems roughly equal
- My king safety is important here

Among my options:
- King moves like f8e8 or f8e7
- Bishop moves like f7e8, f7g6, f7e6, or f7h5
- Pawn advances like h7h6, g7g6, b7b6, e4e3, h7h5, g7g5, or b7b5

I'll choose to improve my king's position by moving it to e8, which centralizes it and maintains protection of my bishop on f7.

- My king is on e8 with rooks on g8 and h8
- I have a bishop on f7
- White has a rook on a6 and a bishop on c2
- White's king is on e1

Among my legal moves, I should prioritize king safety and development. The most natural move here is to castle kingside, which would improve my king's safety and connect my rooks.

- I should look for opportunities to improve my piece positioning
- The e4 pawn can potentially advance

After evaluating the options, I'll move my king to e8, which improves my king's position and maintains control of important squares.

- I have two rooks on g8 and h8
- The position appears to be in the late middlegame or early endgame

Key considerations:
1. My king's safety is a priority
2. The e5 pawn is under attack and needs attention
3. I should look for opportunities to improve my piece activity

Among my legal moves, I see several king moves and pawn moves. Moving my king to e8 would be a natural choice to centralize it and move away from the h-file where my rook is currently blocked.

I'm playing as Black and have a material advantage with two rooks, a bishop, and several pawns. My king is on e8 with rooks on g8 and h8. White has a rook on e5, a bishop on c1, and their king on f1.

Looking at my options, I notice:
- My king has several moves available
- My f7 bishop can move in different directions
- I have various pawn moves

The most pressing concern is the White rook on e5, which is attacking my e-pawn. I should consider either defending this pawn or creating counterplay.

One strong move would be to centralize my king with e8d8, which improves my king's position while maintaining control.

e8f8,e8d8,e8d7,f7e6

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

I can see I have 4 legal moves available as Black. Let me analyze the position:

I'm playing as Black and my king is on e8 with three possible king moves (to f8, d8, or d7). I also have a bishop move from f7 to e6.

Looking at the position:
- I have two rooks on g8 and h8
- A bishop on f7
- Pawns on b7, d5, g7, h7
- White has a rook on e5 that's attacking my e-file
- White's king is on f1 with a bishop on c3

The most pressing concern is my king's safety. Moving my bishop to e6 would develop it to a better diagonal, but I need to ensure my king is safe first.

Since White's rook is on e5 controlling the e-file, I should move my king away from that file. Moving to f8 seems most natural as it maintains connection with my rooks and gets out of the e-file.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Looking at the current position and my legal moves, I need to make a strategic decision.

I notice I'm playing as Black and have a bishop on f7, a king on f8, and rooks on g8 and h8. I also have several pawn moves available.

The position appears to be in the endgame phase with relatively few pieces left. My bishop on f7 has several possible moves, and I should consider whether to improve its position.

After analyzing the position, I'll move my bishop to e6, which improves its activity and controls more central squares while maintaining protection of my kingside pawns.

I'm playing as Black and have a material advantage with two rooks, a bishop, and several pawns against White's rook and bishop. My king is on f8 with a rook on h8 and g8. White's king is on f2 with a rook on e1 and a bishop on c3.

Looking at the legal moves, I should consider:
1. King safety - my king on f8 could be better protected
2. Piece coordination - connecting my rooks
3. Potential threats from White's pieces

The move e6f7 (moving my bishop to f7) looks strong because:
- It protects my king
- It maintains control of the important diagonal
- It allows my rooks to connect

Looking at the position, I notice:
- My king is on f8 with rooks on g8 and h8
- I have a bishop on f7
- White has a rook on e1 and king on f1
- White has a bishop on c1

Among my options, I should prioritize safety and development. The bishop on f7 is currently pinned to my king by White's rook on e1. Moving it would expose my king to check, which would be illegal (and that's why it's not in my legal moves list).

I'll develop my queenside pawn to create some space and potential counterplay:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

I need to analyze the position carefully to make the best move as Black.

Looking at the board:
- I have my king on f8 with rooks on g8 and h8
- There's a bishop on f7 that has several possible moves
- I have pawns on b5, d5, g7, and h7
- White has a rook on e5 that's attacking my position
- White's king is on f1 with a bishop on c1

The most critical aspect seems to be the white rook on e5, which is threatening my position. My bishop on f7 is an important defensive piece, but it also has potential for active play.

Among my options:
- Moving the bishop (f7e8, f7g6, f7e6, f7h5) 
- Moving pawns (b5a4, b5b4, h7h6, h7h5, g7g6, g7g5)

I think the best move is to develop my bishop to g6, which maintains protection of my kingside while gaining some space and flexibility.

2. King safety: My king is on f8 with a rook on g8 and h8
3. White has a rook on e5 that could be threatening
4. I have a bishop on g6 with multiple possible moves

Looking at my legal moves, I notice I can move my bishop on g6 in several directions. The bishop is currently well-positioned on the kingside, controlling important squares. Moving my king to f7 could be risky with White's rook on e5.

The move g6e4 with my bishop looks particularly strong as it attacks White's position while maintaining control of important squares. This diagonal looks powerful for my bishop.

I see that White has played b2-b4, which is known as the Sokolsky Opening or the Polish Opening. This is an uncommon first move that aims to control the c5 square and potentially develop the bishop to b2.

Let's check my legal moves to respond to this opening.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Looking at the available moves, I have several good options to respond to White's Sokolsky Opening (1.b4).

The most principled responses include:

1. e7e5 - Taking control of the center immediately
2. c7c5 - Directly challenging White's b4 pawn
3. d7d5 - Another solid central pawn move
4. g8f6 - Developing the knight to a good square

Among these, c7c5 is particularly thematic against b4, as it immediately challenges White's plan. This move undermines White's control of the queenside and can lead to favorable pawn structures for Black.

I can see the current board position. White has played b2-b4 and h2-h3 while as Black I've played c7-c5 and c5-c3. Now I need to check what legal moves I have available.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Now I can see all my legal moves. Let's analyze the position:

1. White has played b4 and h3, which are somewhat passive moves.
2. I've already played c5 and captured on c3, which has disrupted White's pawn structure.
3. I should continue with development and control of the center.

Among my options, developing a knight to f6 is a strong classical move that controls central squares and prepares for kingside castling.

2. White has developed the knight to f3 and has a pawn on h3.
3. I should focus on development and controlling the center.

Among my options, developing the knight to c6 looks strong as it develops a piece, controls central squares, and prepares for potential counterplay against White's b4 pawn. This is a standard developing move that follows opening principles.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

After analyzing the position and available moves, I can see several key considerations:

1. White's bishop on a6 is attacking my queenside
2. I have knights developed to e5 and f6
3. I need to continue development and ensure king safety

One strong move is to develop my bishop with "Bc8-d7", which would protect my b7 pawn from the white bishop on a6 and continue my development.

I apologize for the error. Let me check the legal moves again and make a valid move.

Looking at the legal moves list, I see that "c8d7" wasn't included. Let me select a strong move from the available options.

The move "d7d6" looks good as it develops my position, controls the center, and prepares to develop my light-squared bishop. This helps me establish a solid pawn structure.

Looking at the position, I see several key elements:

1. White has a bishop on a6 attacking my b7 pawn
2. I have knights on e5 and f6 in active positions
3. My king is still in the center, and I should consider castling
4. My dark-squared bishop is still on c8 and needs development

One of my strongest moves here is to castle kingside with h8g8, which would improve my king safety. Alternatively, I could develop my bishop to positions like e6 or f5.

After analyzing the position, I believe castling is the priority to secure my king.

After analyzing the position and available moves, I can see I'm playing as Black in what appears to be a complex middlegame position. 

I notice my king is on e8, and I have several developed pieces including knights on e5 and f6, bishops on e6 and f8, and my queen on d8. I also see that White has advanced a pawn to h6 and has the king on e1.

Looking at the available moves, I should prioritize improving my position and potentially increasing pressure on White's position. The knight on e5 has some good outposts, particularly f3 which would attack White's king and queen.

I'll play the knight move to f3, which puts pressure on White's queen and king while developing my attack.

After analyzing the position, I see several strong options as Black. I notice my knight on f6 has good mobility, and my bishop on e6 is also active. My king is safe, and I have good pawn structure.

Looking at the board, I see White has their king on e5, which is quite exposed in the center. This presents a tactical opportunity. I can attack the king with my knight from f6 by moving to d5, creating a fork between the king and potentially other pieces.

I'll make this move:

Player_Black (to Proxy):

I'll analyze the position and make a strong move as Black.

Looking at the board, I notice:
- I have a knight on d5 in a strong central position
- My bishop on e6 is developed and active
- White has a knight on f3 and a pawn on e4
- My queen is on d8 and could be developed

Among my options, I see several strong candidate moves:

1. Knight moves from d5 - particularly Nf4 looks active, attacking the e2 square
2. Bishop moves from e6 - Bg4 would pin the knight to the queen
3. Queen development - Qb6 could apply pressure on the queenside

After evaluation, I believe the best move is to develop my knight to f4, putting pressure on White's position.

3. My bishop on e6 has several good diagonal options
4. White's king appears to be somewhat exposed on e5

I'll castle kingside to improve my king's safety and connect my rooks, which is a priority in the middlegame.

After analyzing the position and available moves, I notice several tactical opportunities. The most striking is that my knight on f4 can attack White's king on e5 with a check.

I'll play the knight fork:

make_move f4d5

This move:
1. Checks the White king on e5
2. Simultaneously attacks the White pawn on c7
3. Creates a powerful knight fork

This forces White to move their king, after which I can capture the pawn on c7, gaining material advantage.

3. I have a bishop on e6 with multiple diagonal moves
4. My rook on a8 can move to b8 or c8
5. I can make various pawn moves

Looking at the position, I notice White's king is exposed on e5 with a knight on f6. I should consider moves that improve my position and potentially exploit this.

The bishop on e6 has a strong diagonal and could be developed further with e6g4, putting pressure on White's position.

I'll make this move:

I see that I have two legal moves available as Black:

1. d8d7: Moving my queen from d8 to d7
2. g4d7: Moving my bishop from g4 to d7

Looking at the position, I notice that my bishop on g4 can capture something on d7, which appears to be a white pawn. This would be a material gain. Moving my queen to d7 doesn't seem to offer any immediate advantage.

The bishop capture on d7 is clearly the better move as it wins material without any apparent drawbacks.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Now I have a clear picture of the position and my available moves. 

Looking at the board, I notice several important factors:
- White has a pawn on c7, which is quite advanced
- My king is on e8 with a rook on a8 and h8 (though h8 is empty on the board display)
- I have a bishop on e7 that's currently blocked by the pawn on d7
- White's king is on e3 with some development

One of my priorities should be to improve my development and address the advanced c7 pawn. I see that I can develop my bishop with d7c6, which would attack the white bishop on b5.

1. I have only two legal moves: d8d7 (moving my queen from d8 to d7) or b7c6 (moving a pawn from b7 to c6)
2. The position appears quite unusual with White's queen on a4 and several pieces already exchanged
3. My king on e8 seems to be in a potentially vulnerable position

Between the two options:
- Moving my queen to d7 (d8d7) develops the queen slightly but keeps it centralized and potentially helps connect my rooks
- Moving my b-pawn to c6 (b7c6) would strengthen my queenside but doesn't address any immediate threats

I'll choose to move my queen, which gives me more flexibility and helps improve my position.

Looking at my options:
- I should prioritize development and king safety
- I need to watch out for potential threats from White's queen and knight
- Developing my queenside pieces would be beneficial

Among my legal moves, developing my rook with a8d8 or a8c8 looks strong, giving me control of the d-file or c-file. Alternatively, pushing e7e6 would help develop my light-squared bishop.

I'll choose to develop my rook to the central d-file:

Looking at the legal moves, I see several key options:
- Rook moves (h8g8, d8c8, d8b8, d8a8)
- Queen moves (d7c6)
- Various pawn moves

Given that my king on e8 is somewhat exposed and White's queen is on a4, I should prioritize safety and development. Moving my rook from d8 to c8 would connect my rooks and strengthen my position.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

I need to analyze this position carefully. 

I notice several key elements:
- I'm playing as Black with my king on e8
- White has a queen on a4 which could be dangerous
- White has a pawn on d5 and a knight on b5 controlling central squares
- My queen is on d7, somewhat restricted

Looking at my legal moves, I should prioritize king safety and development. The most concerning issue is my king's position with limited defenders.

I'll develop my rook with:

make_move c8d8

This move:
1. Develops my rook toward the center
2. Connects my rooks
3. Provides better protection for my king
4. Maintains flexibility for future plans

Given the position, this appears to be a capture of a White pawn on d6. This is a good move as it eliminates one of my opponent's pawns.

Looking at the position, I need to assess the situation carefully. I notice that:

1. White has two queens (on c3 and a4), which is a significant material advantage
2. My king on e8 is exposed with a white queen on c3 threatening the diagonal
3. I have my rooks on d8 and h8, and a bishop on f8

Among my legal moves, I should prioritize king safety. The move e8e7 would get my king out of the diagonal attack from the queen on c3, but it would block my bishop. 

A better option is to castle kingside with h8g8, which would protect my king and connect my rooks.

I notice several important features:
- White has two queens (on c3 and a4)
- My king is on e8 with a rook on d8 and f8, and a bishop on f8
- White has a bishop on c3 that's attacking my queen on d7
- My position is somewhat cramped

Among my options, I should prioritize king safety and development. The move e8e7 (King to e7) would be dangerous as it would leave my king exposed. 

The move f8e7 (Bishop to e7) looks strong as it develops a piece while protecting the d8 rook and maintaining king safety. This also prepares for potential castling queenside later.

I need to analyze this position carefully. I'm playing as Black and I notice several important factors:

1. Material: I have a queen, two rooks, a bishop, and several pawns. White has two queens, which is a significant material advantage for them.

2. King safety: My king on e8 is in the same file as a White queen on c8, though there's my rook on d8 in between.

3. Threats: White's queen on c8 is threatening my queen on c6, and White's bishop on b2 is also targeting my queen.

4. Opportunities: I have my queen on c6 with many possible moves, and my bishop on e7 can develop further.

Given the material disadvantage (White has two queens), I need to look for active counterplay. One strong move would be to move my queen to attack White's king on e5 while maintaining protection of my own pieces.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

I need to analyze this position carefully. I'm playing as Black and I notice several important features:

1. Material: The position appears roughly equal with queens for both sides
2. King safety: My king (Black) is on e8 with a rook on d8 and g8
3. White's king is exposed on d4 in the center
4. I have a bishop on e7 that could develop an attack

Looking at my legal moves, I see potential for improving my position. The most promising options are:

1. Protect my king with `e8f8` (King to f8)
2. Develop my bishop with `e7f6`, `e7g5`, or `e7h4`
3. Advance pawns with moves like `h7h5` or `g7g5` to gain space

Given White's king position in the center, I should prioritize safety for my king while preparing to exploit White's exposed king.

- White has a queen on f6 and c8, creating pressure
- My king is on f8 with rooks on d8 and g8
- I have a bishop on e7 that could develop
- White's king is on d4, quite exposed

Looking at my options, I should prioritize king safety and counterplay. The bishop on e7 has some good diagonal moves available.

I'll move my bishop to g5, which attacks White's queen on c1 and creates a potential pin if White's king moves to e5. This gives me active counterplay.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

I see all my legal moves now. Let me analyze the position:

I notice that:
- I'm playing as Black with my king on f8
- White has a queen on e5 and another piece on a4 (appears to be a queen as well)
- White's king is on d4
- I have rooks on d8 and g8
- There's a bishop on e1 that appears to be mine

Looking at the position, I see a potential strong move with my rook. Since my rook on d8 is already in the same file as White's king, I can consider moving it to threaten the king or control important squares.

I'll make the move:

make_move d8d7

- 'get_current_board' to get the schema and current status of the board
- 'get_legal_moves' to get a UCI formatted list of available moves
- 'make_move <UCI formatted move>' when you are ready to complete your turn (e.g., 'make_move e2e4')

I notice I have a bishop on e1 that's attacking the white king on d4, but it's not a check because the king can move. I also have rooks on d7 and g6, and my king is on f6.

Looking at the available moves, I see that my bishop on e1 has several strong options. Moving it to h4 would create a powerful diagonal attack, and it would maintain pressure on the white king.

I'll make this move:

I see I have three legal moves available as Black:

1. f8e7 - Moving my king from f8 to e7
2. d7e7 - Moving my rook from d7 to e7
3. h4e7 - Moving my bishop from h4 to e7

Analyzing the position:
- I notice I'm in check from the white queen on e5
- I have three ways to deal with this check:
  - Move my king to e7
  - Block with my rook by moving it to e7
  - Block with my bishop by moving it to e7

The best move here is to move my king to e7, as it gets out of check while maintaining my material. Moving the rook or bishop to e7 would result in them being captured by the queen, losing material.

- White has a queen on a4 which could be dangerous

Looking at my options, I see a strong move with my bishop on h4. It can attack White's king and queen simultaneously by moving to f6, creating a fork.

Looking at the position, I see that my bishop on c3 has several good options. It's currently attacking diagonally and could potentially create threats. My king on e7 seems relatively safe but needs to be careful.

One strong move appears to be using my bishop to attack White's knight on e5, which would threaten a piece and improve my position:

After analyzing the position, I see several key factors:
1. I'm playing as Black with my king on e7
2. White's king is on d4 and is somewhat exposed
3. I have a rook on d7 that could be developed
4. I have a bishop on a1 with a strong diagonal

One of my strongest moves is to develop my bishop with a check:

Player_Black (to Proxy):

I need to analyze this position carefully. 

I see that I'm playing as Black and have my king on e7. White's king is on d4, and there are various pieces on the board. Looking at the legal moves, I have options with my rook on g8, my king, my bishop on f6, and my pawns.

The most pressing concern is my king's safety. I notice White has a queen on a4 and bishops on b7 and b4, which could be threatening. My bishop on f6 is a strong piece that could potentially attack White's king.

After evaluating the position, I'll move my bishop to attack White's queen:

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Looking at the position, I need to make a strategic decision as Black. 

I notice that:
- My king is on e7 with White's king on d4
- White has a queen on a4 and two bishops (b7 and c3)
- I have two rooks (d7 and g8)
- The position appears to be in the middlegame/endgame phase

One of my most active pieces is the rook on g8, which controls the g-file. I should consider centralizing my rooks or improving my king's safety.

I'll centralize my rook and increase its activity by moving it to the center of the board:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

After analyzing the position, I see I'm playing as Black with my king on e7 and rooks on d7 and e8. White has a queen on a4 and the white king is on d4.

I notice my king is in the center, and I should improve its safety. Castling would be ideal, but since my king has already moved to e7, that's not possible. Instead, I'll focus on king safety and piece coordination.

The move e8g8 in the legal moves list appears to be a typo since castling kingside would be e8g8, but my king is on e7, not e8. Looking at the board again, I see my rook is on e8 and can move to g8.

I'll move my rook to h8, which protects the h7 pawn and gives my king more space to maneuver.

- Potentially activating my rooks

One strong move would be to centralize my rook with h8d8, creating a powerful battery of rooks on the d-file that puts pressure on White's position.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

After analyzing the position, I see I'm playing as Black and I have several options. I notice my king is on e7 with a rook on b7 and another on h8. White has a queen on a8 and the white king is on d4.

One of the strongest moves I can make is to improve my rook position with:

make_move h8g8

This centralizes my rook on the back rank, maintains protection of my king, and increases my control of the 8th rank. This is a flexible move that maintains my defensive setup while preparing for potential counterplay.

After analyzing the position, I can see I'm playing as Black and I have a few key pieces: two rooks (on g8 and b7), my king on e7, and some pawns. White has a queen on a8, a king on d4, and some other pieces.

My king is somewhat exposed with a white knight on e5 nearby. I should prioritize king safety and development of my pieces.

One strong move would be to bring my rook into play with `b7d7`, creating a more connected position and preparing to control the d-file.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

I can see that I'm playing as Black, and I have a king on e7 with only four legal moves. Let me analyze the position:

1. My king is on e7 with four possible moves: f8, d8, f7, and f6
2. White has a queen on a8 and a king on d4
3. I have rooks on g8 and d8
4. There appears to be a check threat from White's rook on e5

Looking at the options:
- Moving to f8 would put me in the corner, potentially limiting my options
- Moving to d8 would block my own rook
- Moving to f7 keeps me central but might expose me to attacks
- Moving to f6 moves me away from White's rook on e5

I believe the best move is to move my king to f6, which gives me more space and moves away from White's rook on e5.

4. I have several pawn moves available

Looking at the position, I notice my rook on d7 is under attack by White's queen on a8. I also see that my rook on g8 can potentially deliver a check by moving to d8, which would also protect my other rook.

The move Rd8 (g8d8) looks strong as it:
1. Delivers check to the white king
2. Protects my other rook on d7 from the queen
3. Creates a powerful alignment of my rooks

Looking at the board position, I see I'm playing as Black and have several tactical opportunities. 

The position shows I have two rooks (on d7 and d8), my king on f6, and some pawns. White has a queen on a8, a king on d4, rooks on e5 and g1, a bishop on a1, a knight on f3, and several pawns.

I notice White's king is on d4 and my rook on d7 is on the same file. This gives me a potential check if I move my rook to d4. However, that's not in my legal moves list, likely because the pawn on d6 blocks that path.

Looking at my options, I see a strong move would be to move my rook from d8 to h8, controlling the h-file and potentially setting up threats along the back rank.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

After analyzing the position, I see I'm playing as Black and have several options. 

I notice my king is on f7 with a white rook on e5 that's currently attacking the d5 pawn. I also have a rook on h8 and another on d7, plus a queen is attacking my a8 square.

The most critical move appears to be protecting my king. Moving my rook to cover the king or creating an escape square would be prudent.

I'll move my h8 rook to f8, which protects my king and creates a stronger defensive position.

3. White's king is on d4, somewhat exposed

I notice I can create a direct threat with my rook on d7 by moving it to e7, which would attack White's rook on e5. This would force White to either move the rook or defend it, giving me the initiative.

I can see the current board position. This appears to be a complex middlegame/endgame position where I'm playing as Black. I have two rooks (on e5 and e8), my king is on f6, and I have several pawns. White has a queen on a6, a king on d4, a knight on f3, a bishop on a1, and rooks on e1 and h1.

Let me check what legal moves I have available.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Thank you for providing the legal moves. Let me analyze the position and make a decision.

I notice several important features of the position:
- I have two rooks (e5 and e8)
- My king is on f6 with pawns providing some shelter
- White has a queen on a6 which could be dangerous
- White's king is on d4, somewhat exposed

Looking at my options, I see several promising moves:

1. I could move my e8 rook along the back rank (e8h8, e8g8, etc.)
2. I could advance my pawns (g7g6, g7g5, h7h6, h7h5)
3. I could move my f7 pawn (f7f8, f7g8, f7g6)
4. I could move my e7 pawn forward

The most active and threatening move appears to be to connect my rooks by moving the e8 rook to e1, but that's not in my legal move list, so it must be blocked.

Given the exposed position of White's king, I think my best move is to activate my rook on the 8th rank to put pressure on White's position. Moving to h8 would align it with White's king's potential escape squares.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

I can see that I'm playing as Black, and I have a king on f7 with 5 possible moves. Looking at the board position:

- White has a queen on a7, a king on d4, a knight on g4, a bishop on a1, and rooks on e1 and h1
- Black has a king on f7, rooks on e7 and h8, and several pawns

This appears to be a difficult position for Black. My king on f7 is somewhat exposed, and I need to find the safest square.

Let me analyze the available moves:
- f7g8: Moving to the corner might be safer
- f7f8: Moving back rank
- f7e8: Moving back rank
- f7g6: Moving forward diagonally
- f7f6: Moving forward

I need to avoid checks and find the safest square. The white queen on a7 controls the a7-g1 diagonal, so f6 would be unsafe. The white knight on g4 controls e5, f6, and h6, making g6 unsafe. The white rook on e1 controls the e-file.

The safest move appears to be moving to the back rank, and g8 seems particularly good as it gets my king to the corner where it's typically safer in endgames.

This appears to be an endgame position where I need to be careful about checks and potential mate threats.

After analyzing the legal moves, I see that my rook on e4 has several strong options. Moving it to e8 would be particularly powerful as it would control the back rank.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Looking at the current position, I need to make a strategic decision as Black.

I notice that:
1. I have my king on e8 with rooks on both sides (e5 and g8)
2. White has a queen on a4 and king on d4
3. I have several options including king moves and pawn advances

The most pressing concern is my king's safety. With White's queen on a4, I should be careful about potential threats.

Since I still have both rooks and haven't castled yet, and my king is currently safe, I'll castle kingside to improve my king's safety and connect my rooks.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

I apologize for the error. Let me check the board again more carefully. It seems I misinterpreted the position. Looking at the board again, I can see that my king is already on g8 (♚ in the top right area), not on e8 as I incorrectly assumed. The rook is on e8 and h8.

Let me select a better move based on the actual position.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

After carefully analyzing the position again, I see that my king is already on g8 with rooks on e8 and h8. 

Looking at my options, I need to consider both safety and potential counterplay. White's queen on a4 and knight on g5 could be threatening, so I should be careful.

I'll advance my h-pawn to h6, which challenges White's knight on g5 and gives my king some breathing room. This is a solid defensive move that improves my position.

1. My king is on g8 with a rook on e8 and h8
2. White has a queen on a4 and king on d4
3. White's knight on g4 is attacking my f6 pawn
4. I need to consider safety and potential threats

Looking at my legal moves, I see I can move my king, rooks, or several pawns. The most critical area appears to be my king's safety.

Since White's queen is far from my king and there are no immediate checkmate threats, I should focus on improving my position. One strong move would be to centralize my rook on the e-file, which controls the center and puts pressure on White's position.

This is a very favorable position for me as Black. I can deliver a check with my rook, forcing the White king to move, which would give me a significant advantage.

Looking at the board, I see I'm playing as Black with my king on g8 and a rook on h8 and d4. White has a queen on a4, a king on b2, a bishop on b2, a knight on g4, and several pawns. 

The most critical aspects of this position:
1. My king's safety is a priority
2. My rook on d4 is currently under attack by White's queen on a4
3. I need to consider potential threats and counterplay

Among my legal moves:
- Moving the rook on d4 is urgent since it's under attack
- The move d4d5 would attack White's pawn on c3
- Moving my king to f8 could improve king safety

After evaluation, I believe the best move is to save my rook while creating a threat:

The most critical aspect appears to be my king's safety. With White's queen on a7, I need to be careful about potential threats.

Looking at the board, I can see that White's queen is on g7, and my rook is on h7. This means I can capture White's queen with my rook.

This is an excellent move as capturing the queen will give me a significant material advantage. The queen is the most valuable piece after the king, so removing it from the board will greatly improve my winning chances.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

I need to analyze this position carefully. I see that:

1. I have my king on g8 with a rook on g7
2. I have another rook on d5 that's active in the center
3. I have pawns on d6, f5, and h6
4. White has their king on b2 with pieces including a bishop on b2, knight on f3, and rooks on e1 and g1

Looking at the position, my rook on d5 is very active and threatening. I can either continue the attack with this rook or improve my king's position.

The most powerful move appears to be to continue the attack with my d5 rook, potentially targeting White's back rank or a-pawn.

4. I also see my rook on e1 can capture White's bishop on c1 with e1c1

Capturing the rook on g1 seems most valuable, as a rook is worth more than a bishop. This would eliminate one of White's major pieces and improve my material advantage.

Now I have a clear picture of the position and my available moves. Let me analyze the situation:

I have two rooks (g7 and g1), which are powerful pieces. My king is on g8, and I have pawns on d6, f5, and h6.

Looking at the available moves, I should consider:
1. Using my rooks actively
2. Advancing my pawns when beneficial
3. Keeping my king safe

The rook on g1 can capture the bishop on c1, which would be a material gain. However, I need to check if that's safe.

The rook on g7 is well-positioned, protecting my king and controlling the g-file.

I think one of my strongest moves is to use my rook on g1 to capture White's bishop on c1, gaining material advantage.

After analyzing the position, I can see I'm playing as Black with my king on g8 and rooks on g7 and d1. There's a white knight on g5 that's attacking my h7 square, and my pawn on f5 is undefended.

I'll play a strong move to improve my position and address immediate threats:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

I need to analyze this position carefully as Black.

I see that I have a rook on d1 and my king on g8, while White's king is on e2. I also have pawns on d6, f5, and h6, while White has pawns on a4, c3, g4, g5, g7, and h4.

Looking at my options:
- I can move my king to various squares
- I can move my rook on d1 to multiple squares
- I can advance my pawns

The most powerful piece I have is the rook on d1, which is currently undefended by White. I should use this rook to create threats or gain material.

Since White's king is on e2, moving my rook to e1 would put the king in check and force a response. This would be a strong move that restricts White's options.

Thank you for providing the legal moves. Let me analyze the position and make the best move.

I notice several important aspects of the position:
- I have a rook on d1 that controls the entire d-file and first rank
- White's king is on e2, which is in the same file my rook could attack
- There appears to be a typo in the legal moves list: "f5g4" and "f5f4" are listed, but I don't see a pawn on f5 on the board (I see one on f4)

The most powerful move appears to be to attack White's king with my rook:

Player_Black (to Proxy):

I see the current position and my legal moves. Let me analyze the situation:

1. I'm playing as Black with my king on g8 and a rook on g1
2. There's a pawn structure with both sides having pawns
3. My rook on g1 has control of the g-file and can move to many squares

Looking at my options, I notice my rook on g1 has significant mobility and can potentially create threats. The most active move would be to use my rook to attack White's position.

I'll move my rook to g2, putting pressure on White's king at f2 and threatening the g-pawns.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

I need to analyze the position carefully before making my move.

Looking at the board:
- I'm playing as Black with my king on g8
- White's king is on g2
- There's a pawn race situation with pawns on both sides
- I need to consider king safety and pawn advancement

The most critical decision is whether to advance my pawns or improve my king position. Since this appears to be an endgame, king activity is very important.

I'll move my king to h7, which maintains protection of my h6 pawn while giving my king more space and flexibility. This is a standard endgame principle - activate your king.

I see the position now. This is a king and pawn endgame where:

1. I have my king on g8 and pawns on d6, f5, and h7
2. White has their king on g7 and pawns on a4, c6, g5, g6, and h5

Let me analyze the position:
- My king is restricted to g8 and h8 due to White's king on g7
- The pawn on f5 can advance or capture
- The pawn on d6 can advance
- The h7 pawn can move to h8 (promotion square)

The most critical decision is whether to promote my h7 pawn immediately. Since h7-h8 is a legal move, this means I can promote to a queen right away, which would be decisive.

I can see we're in an endgame position where I'm playing as Black. Let me analyze the position:

1. I have my king on h8 with three possible king moves
2. I have pawns on d6, f5, and h6
3. White has pawns on a4, c3, g4, g5, h4, and h5
4. White's king is on h1

Looking at the pawn structure, I need to consider:
- My f5 pawn is under attack by White's g4 pawn
- My h6 pawn is blocked by White's g5 and h5 pawns
- My d6 pawn has a clear path forward

The most promising move appears to be advancing my d-pawn, which has the clearest path to promotion. This will create a passed pawn and force White to deal with it.

The most critical move appears to be advancing my d5 pawn to d4, which continues the race to promote. This is likely my strongest option as it advances my most promising pawn.

- I can advance my pawns (h6g5, f5g4, f5f4, d4d3)

Given that I have a pawn on d4 that's quite advanced and has a clear path to promotion, I'll push that pawn forward.

I see the position now. I'm playing as Black and have a queen on d1, king on h8, and pawns on f4, g3, and h3. White has a king on h1 and pawns on a3, c2, g3, g4, and h4.

Let me check my legal moves to make the best decision.

Now I can see all my legal moves. Looking at the position, I notice I have a queen on d1 with many options, including a direct checkmate opportunity.

Since my queen can move to h1 where the white king is located, and there are no pieces in between to block the check, I can deliver an immediate checkmate.

2. White's king is on h1
3. I have pawns on f5, g7, and h7
4. White has pawns on a3, c2, g7, and h4

Looking at my options:
- h8g8: Moving my king to g8
- h8g7: Moving my king to g7 (capturing White's pawn)
- f5g4: Moving my f5 pawn diagonally to g4
- f5f4: Moving my f5 pawn forward to f4

The best move appears to be capturing White's pawn with my king, which also improves my king position.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

I see the current position and my legal moves. I'm playing as Black, and my king is on g7. I have four possible king moves:

1. g7h8 - Moving king to the corner
2. g7g8 - Moving king up
3. g7f8 - Moving king diagonally up-left
4. g7f6 - Moving king down-left

Looking at the position, I need to be careful about my king's safety. The White king is on h1, far away from my king. I have pawns on g7 and h7, while White has pawns on a7, c7, and f6.

The move g7f6 would put my king in front of White's f-pawn, which could be dangerous if that pawn advances. Moving to h8 would place my king in the corner with less mobility.

The best move appears to be g7f8, which keeps my king protected, maintains good king mobility, and helps control important squares.

I can see that I'm playing as Black, and I'm in a very simplified position. I'm in check from White's queen on c8, and I only have two legal moves for my king: f8e7 or f8g7.

Let me analyze the position:
- My king is on f8, and White's king is on h1
- White has a queen on c8 giving check
- There are several pawns on the board, but they're not immediately relevant to my safety

Between the two moves:
- Moving to e7 (f8e7) would place my king on an open file, potentially exposing it to more checks
- Moving to g7 (f8g7) keeps my king closer to the corner and might provide better shelter

I'll choose to move my king to g7.

I see my options now. I have three legal moves for my king:
- g7h8: Move king to the corner
- g7g8: Move king to the back rank
- g7f8: Move king to the left

Looking at this position critically:
- White's queen on c7 is very powerful and controls many squares
- White has a pawn on f6 which restricts my king's movement
- I need to keep my king safe while maintaining control of my pawns

The move g7f8 seems most prudent as it:
1. Moves away from the edge of the board where kings are more vulnerable
2. Maintains protection of my g6 pawn
3. Gives my king slightly more mobility

You are a professional chess player and you play as black. Now is your turn to make a move. Before making a move you can pick one of the following actions:
- 'get_current_board' to get the schema and current status of the board
- 'get_legal_moves' to get a UCI formatted list of available moves
- 'make_move <UCI formatted move>' when you are ready to complete your turn (e.g., 'make_move e2e4')

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Looking at the position, I need to make a solid developing move as Black. I have several good options:

1. Developing my knight to f6 (g8f6) would be a standard move, controlling the center and preparing for castling.
2. Developing my knight to c6 (b8c6) would support my e5 pawn and develop naturally.
3. Developing my bishop to c5 (f8c5) or e7 (f8e7) would be reasonable.

Since White has played the somewhat unusual 1.b4 followed by 2.e3, I'll respond with a solid classical development. I'll develop my knight to f6, which controls the center, prepares for castling, and is generally a strong developing move in most openings.

I'll develop my dark-squared bishop to improve my position and control more of the center.

Looking at the position, I can see that:
1. White has developed some pieces
2. My king is still in the center
3. I have both knights developed
4. Castling would improve my king safety and help connect my rooks

This seems like the perfect time to castle kingside.

I notice I'm playing a Sicilian Defense type position with knights developed to c6 and f6, and a bishop on e7. White has a knight on a3 and has pushed pawns to f4 and g4, suggesting an aggressive kingside approach.

Looking at my options:
- I could castle with g8h8 (O-O)
- I could develop my bishop with e7d6 or e7c5
- I could advance my e-pawn with e5e4
- I could make a knight move like f6e4 to attack the center

Castling is a priority for safety, and I should get my king to safety before White's kingside attack develops further.

I'll play a solid move that improves my position and prepares for potential kingside defense:

make_move g7g6

This move:
1. Strengthens my kingside pawn structure
2. Prepares to fianchetto my bishop to g7 later
3. Creates a safe square for my king at g7 if needed
4. Maintains flexibility in my position

This is a standard move in many openings that helps secure my king's position while maintaining development options.

After analyzing the position, I can see I'm playing as Black and have several options. 

I notice that:
- My king is on g8 with castling still possible to h8
- I have a pawn on e5 that could advance or capture
- My knight on f6 has multiple options
- My bishop on e7 can move to several squares

Given the position, I'll castle kingside to improve my king's safety:

After analyzing the position, I see that I'm playing as Black in what appears to be a Sicilian Defense structure with some unusual piece placements. White has advanced pawns on f4 and g4, and I have a knight on f6 and bishops on e7 and c8.

I notice several good options:
- I could castle kingside with h8g8
- I could develop my knight with moves like f6g4 attacking White's pawn
- I could push e5-e4 to gain space in the center

Since castling is a priority for safety and my king is exposed in the center, I'll castle kingside.

After analyzing the position, I see several key aspects:

1. I'm playing as Black and have a knight on f6 that could develop
2. My e5 pawn is under potential pressure
3. My king is still in the center and I haven't castled yet
4. I have a bishop on e7 that could be developed

One of my strongest moves here would be to castle kingside, which would bring my king to safety and connect my rooks.

I notice my king is on g8 with a rook on f8, suggesting I haven't castled yet. My e-pawn has advanced to e5, creating some central tension.

Among my options, I should focus on improving my position and responding to any threats. The knight on f6 is well-placed but could be developed further. Moving my bishop from e7 to d6 would increase its activity and pressure the center.

- I have a knight on f6 and bishops on d6 and c8
- White has a queen on f6 and king on f5
- My king is on h8 without castling rights
- There appears to be some pressure on the kingside

One of the strongest moves I see is to develop my knight on f6 to g4, which attacks White's queen on f6 and creates pressure on e3. This is a tactical opportunity.

I'll play the knight move e3g2, capturing White's queen, which is a decisive material advantage.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

After analyzing the position and my available legal moves, I notice several key factors:

1. My king is in the corner at h8, and I have the option to castle kingside (h8g8)
2. My knight on g2 is active and has several good outposts
3. My dark-squared bishop on d6 has good mobility
4. White's king is exposed on g4

I'll castle kingside to improve my king's safety, which is a priority in this middlegame position.

Looking at the position, I see White's king is exposed on g4, which presents tactical opportunities. My knight on g2 can fork the king and rook with Nf4+.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

After analyzing the position and the available moves, I notice a very strong tactical opportunity. White's king is dangerously exposed on g5, and I have a knight on f4 that can deliver a devastating check.

The move Nf4-h3+ looks particularly strong, as it's a discovered check from the bishop on d6 while also attacking with the knight. This should force the white king to move and potentially lead to a winning position.

- I have a knight on h3 that could potentially attack
- My king is on g8 with some pawn protection
- There appears to be some tension in the center

One of the most promising moves is to use my knight on h3 to attack. The move h3f2+ would be a knight fork, attacking White's king and potentially another piece.

Let me make this move:

- My king is on g8 with a rook on f8
- I have a knight on f2 that's attacking multiple squares
- There's pressure on the e-file

One of the strongest moves I see is my knight on f2 capturing White's knight on e4, which would win a piece. This is a tactical opportunity I shouldn't miss.

After analyzing the position and available moves, I see I have a knight on c3 that can make several strong moves. I also notice my king is on g8 with a rook on f8, and I have a bishop on c5 that has good diagonals.

I'll play the knight move c3e4, which attacks the center, puts pressure on White's position, and improves my piece activity.

One strong move would be to develop my rook by connecting them:

I need to analyze the position carefully before making my move.

Looking at the board, I notice:
- White's king is on f3, somewhat exposed
- I have a knight on e4 that could be developed further
- My king is on g8 with some pawn protection
- I have two bishops active, one on c5 and one on c8
- There appears to be potential for tactical play

One of the strongest moves I see is to develop my knight from e4 to f6, which:
1. Improves my knight's position
2. Protects the g8 square where my king is
3. Maintains pressure in the center
4. Develops toward a kingside attack

- I have two bishops developed (c5 and c8)
- My king is on g8 with some pawn protection
- There's a pawn on b2 that appears to be White's
- I have a knight on f6 that could be active

The bishop on c5 has good diagonal control and several possible moves. I could also consider kingside castling (g8h8) since my king is already on g8 and the rook is on h8.

Given the position, I'll play the bishop move c5f8, which retreats my bishop to a safe square while maintaining some diagonal control and protecting my kingside.

After analyzing the position and my available moves, I can see I'm playing as Black and need to make a strategic decision.

I notice my king is on g8 and my kingside is somewhat exposed with the white king on f3 and a white knight on g3. I should prioritize king safety and development.

One of the strongest moves available is developing my dark-squared bishop with:

make_move f8g7

This move:
1. Develops my bishop to a strong diagonal
2. Strengthens my kingside position
3. Controls important central squares
4. Prepares for potential kingside castling by hand (moving the king to h8)

The fianchetto position on g7 is a classic and strong setup for the bishop.

I notice my knight on f6 has several options, and I have a bishop on g7 that's active. My queen is still on d8, and I should consider developing more pieces and improving my king safety.

Looking at the legal moves, I think developing my queen to e7 would be a good choice. This develops a piece, connects my rooks, and prepares for potential castling on the kingside (h8) later.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

After analyzing the position and available moves, I can see I'm playing as Black in what appears to be a complex middlegame position. 

I notice several key aspects:
- My king is on g8 with some exposure
- I have a queen on c5 with many possible moves
- White has a bishop on c1 and knights on e4 and e5
- White's king is on f3, somewhat exposed

One of the strongest moves available is to attack White's knight on e5 with my queen, which would create a powerful threat.

After analyzing the position, I notice several important factors:
- My king is on g8 and can move to h8 or f8
- I have a bishop on c8 that can develop
- My knight on f6 has several options
- I have a bishop on g7 controlling the long diagonal

Looking at the position, I should prioritize king safety and piece coordination. The white bishop on c1 is pointing at my h6 square, so I should be careful about weakening that area.

I'll develop my bishop from c8 to improve my piece coordination and prepare for potential counterplay.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

After analyzing the position, I can see I'm playing as Black with my king on g8. White has a bishop on c1 that's captured one of my pieces, and there's some pressure on the kingside.

Looking at my legal moves, I notice my knight on f6 has some active options. I also see that my king has several moves available, which suggests I might be in a slightly uncomfortable position.

Given the current position, I'll play a solid move to improve my king's safety:

make_move g8h8

This move gets my king to the corner, which is often a safer square in the middlegame and endgame. It removes the king from potential discovered attacks along the g-file and prepares for potential defensive setups.

3. I have two bishops (b7 and g7) and a knight on f6
4. There's a white bishop on b1 that could be threatening my position

Looking at my options, I see I can castle kingside (e8g8), which would improve my king's safety. This is generally a strong move in the middlegame.

I'll castle kingside to improve my king's safety and connect my rooks.

After analyzing the position, I see several key factors:

1. I'm playing as Black and my king is on g8
2. White has a rook on f4 that's threatening my e-pawn
3. I have a bishop on h1 that could capture White's e-pawn
4. My knight on f6 is well-positioned and could potentially attack White's king on g3

One of my strongest moves appears to be capturing White's e-pawn with my bishop:

Player_Black (to Proxy):

After analyzing the position, I see several interesting options:

1. I have a bishop on e4 that's attacking White's rook on f3, but moving it would lose the pin on the white king at g3.
2. My knight on f6 has several good outposts.
3. I could develop my rook on a8 or g8.

The most critical aspect of this position is the bishop on e4 pinning the white king to the rook on f3. I should capitalize on this tactical opportunity.

I'll capture the rook with my bishop:

Let me analyze the position:

I'm playing as Black and I notice several key elements:
- I have a knight on e4 that's quite active and could potentially fork pieces
- White has a bishop on a1 and c1, rooks on f3 and b1, and a knight on d3
- My king is on g8 with a rook on a8 and g8, and a bishop on g7

Looking at my options, the knight on e4 has several strong possibilities. In particular, the move e4f2 looks very promising as it would fork White's king on g2 and rook on b1, winning material.

I'll make this move:

2. My king is on g8 with several possible moves
3. I have a bishop on g7 that could be developed
4. My e5 pawn is advanced in the center

Looking at my knight on f2, it seems to be in a very strong position, potentially threatening White's king on g1 and rook on f6. I should consider if there are any tactical opportunities with this knight.

The move Nf2-h3 looks particularly strong as it maintains pressure and attacks White's position while developing my piece to a better square.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Looking at the position, I see that I'm playing as Black and the position is quite complex. I notice:

1. My king is on g8 with a rook on a8 and h8
2. I have a knight on e2 that's quite active
3. I have a bishop on g7
4. White has a bishop on a1 and c8 (which is attacking my rook on a8)
5. White has a rook on f3 and b1

One of my strongest pieces is the knight on e2, which is forking White's king on f4 and rook on c1. This is a powerful tactical opportunity that I should capitalize on.

I'll capture the rook with my knight:

2. There's a white bishop on b1 that's attacking my rook on a8
3. I need to be careful about my king's safety

I'll develop my knight from c1 to d3, which puts pressure on the center and prepares for further development.

3. I have a knight on e4 which is well-positioned and attacking several squares
4. My bishop on g7 is active on the long diagonal

Looking at my options, I see that my knight on e4 is very strong and can make several potential moves. One particularly strong move would be to capture White's rook on e5, which would win material.

I should focus on developing my pieces and controlling the center. Among my options, developing the knight to c6 looks strong as it controls central squares and prepares for castling.

- I have the opportunity to castle kingside (e8g8)

Castling is a priority in the opening/early middlegame to get my king to safety, and I have the opportunity to do so now. This will connect my rooks and improve my king's safety.

Looking at my options, I'll play:

make_move a7a6

This defends my a-pawn from the immediate threat while maintaining my solid position. It's a practical move that addresses White's threat directly without compromising my position or creating weaknesses.

3. I have knights on c6 and f6, bishops on e7 and c8
4. White has advanced a pawn to a4, which I could potentially target

One of my strongest moves appears to be developing my knight to attack White's queen with f6e4, putting pressure on the queen while developing my piece to a more active square.

After analyzing the position, I can see I'm playing as Black and have several good options. 

I notice my king is on g8, and White has a queen on f3 which could be dangerous. I also see my e5 pawn is under attack by White's rook on b5. 

Looking at my options, I should prioritize king safety and addressing immediate threats. Moving my e7 bishop to protect the e5 pawn would be logical, but I also need to consider development and king safety.

One strong move is to castle queenside with:

make_move g8h8

This improves my king safety by moving it to the corner and connects my rooks. It's a solid developing move that addresses my king's position before focusing on other strategic elements.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

After analyzing the position, I see I'm playing as Black and there are several interesting options. 

I notice White has a rook on b4 and a queen on f3, creating some pressure. My king is on g8, and I have several pieces that could be developed or improved.

Looking at my options, I think I should focus on improving my position and addressing potential threats. The move e5-e4 looks particularly strong as it:
1. Advances a central pawn
2. Gains space
3. Challenges White's control of the center
4. Opens lines for my bishop on e7

Therefore, I'll make this move:

Thank you for providing the legal moves. Let me analyze the position and make a decision.

I notice several important aspects of the position:
- White has a rook on a4 attacking my a-pawn
- White's queen is on f3, creating some pressure
- I have both knights developed and bishops on e7 and c8
- My king is on g8 but hasn't castled yet (though I can castle kingside with f8g8)

After evaluating the options, I believe castling kingside would be a good move to improve my king's safety and connect my rooks.

2. I have a knight on c6 that could develop to better squares
3. My e-pawn has advanced to e4, creating some central presence

I'll choose to improve my king's safety by castling queenside, which also connects my rooks:

3. I have knights on c6 and f6, and bishops on e7 and c8

Looking at the position, I should prioritize king safety and development. I see that I can castle kingside with Kg8-h8 (h8g8 in UCI notation), which would improve my king's safety and connect my rooks.

The move h8g8 would move my king directly next to the attacking rook, which would be a serious mistake. The correct defensive move is to castle kingside with f8g8, which will simultaneously move my king to safety and bring my rook into play to defend against the attack.

One strong move would be to develop my knight to d4, creating pressure in the center and potentially threatening White's queen.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

I need to analyze the position carefully before making my move.

The position looks complex with both sides having developed pieces and some tension on the board. I notice:
- White has a queen on b4 that's quite active
- My knight on d4 is well-placed and attacking several squares
- I have two bishops and two knights developed, which is good
- My king is still on g8 without castling

One of the strongest moves I see is to develop my knight on d4 to e6, which would:
1. Control important central squares
2. Threaten White's pawn on f4
3. Improve my piece positioning

I need to analyze this position carefully. I notice several things:
- My king is on g8 and appears to be somewhat exposed
- White has a queen on a4 and a rook on h1
- I have two knights on e6 and f6, and two bishops on e7 and e5
- White has a pawn on a4 that could be captured

Looking at the available moves, I should prioritize king safety and development. The e5 pawn appears to be under attack by White's f4 pawn, so I should consider addressing that.

One strong move would be to develop my queen's rook with:

I'll make a solid developing move that improves my position and addresses potential threats.

- My king is on g8 with a rook on h8
- White has a pawn on a3 threatening my pawn structure
- I have knights on f6 and d4, with the d4 knight being particularly active
- I have a bishop on e7 that could develop

The knight on d4 is very well placed and has several good options. Moving it to e6 would create a strong central presence and protect my e-pawn. The knight on f6 is also well positioned.

I think one of my best moves is to develop my bishop on e7 to improve my position and prepare for potential castling.

One particularly strong move I see is Nd4-f3+, which gives check to the white king and also attacks the white bishop on g1. This forces White to respond to the check and might allow me to win material.

One of the strongest moves I see is to activate my queen with a threat. Moving the queen to g4 creates pressure on the kingside and threatens the white pawn on g2.

I notice my queen on g4 has many options, and there are tactical possibilities. Looking at the board, I see White has a knight on f3 that could be captured by my pawn on e4, which would be a material gain.

I'll make this capture:

One of the strongest moves appears to be attacking with my queen. The move g4f4 looks particularly strong as it puts pressure on White's f-pawn while maintaining control of key squares.

After analyzing the position and available moves, I see several key factors:

1. My king is on g8 with the rook on h8, so castling is not an option
2. White has a rook on e5 that's attacking my position
3. My queen on d4 is active and has many possible moves
4. I have a knight on f6 that could develop further

Looking at the position, I notice my queen on d4 can attack White's rook on e5, which would be a favorable exchange for me. This would remove a dangerous attacking piece from White's arsenal.

This move creates a powerful threat against White's king on f2, putting immediate pressure on my opponent. The queen on f4 attacks the king and creates multiple threats that White will need to address immediately.

After analyzing the position and my available moves, I notice I have a strong attack with my queen on f4 and bishops on d6 and g4. 

I'll play a move that increases my attacking pressure and targets White's king position. The move Qf4-e3 looks particularly strong as it threatens the king and maintains control of key squares.

I notice that:
- I have two bishops (on d6 and g4) and a knight on f6 that are actively placed
- My king is on g8 with rooks on b8 and h8
- There's a pawn on f3 that appears to be threatening White's king on e5

One of the strongest moves I see is to advance my f-pawn with:

make_move f3f2

This move directly threatens White's king with check and will likely force White to respond to this immediate threat. It creates significant pressure and could lead to material gain or even checkmate opportunities in the following moves.

This knight move to e4 is excellent because:
1. It attacks White's king on e5
2. It creates a fork threat against multiple pieces
3. It places my knight on a strong central square
4. It increases my piece activity and control of the center

This move should force White to respond to the immediate threat to their king.

3. I have both rooks on the back rank

Looking at my options, I notice my knight on e4 is particularly strong and can create threats. One of the most powerful moves is:

make_move e4f6

This knight move to f6 creates a double attack:
1. It checks the White king on e5
2. It threatens the White rook on f1

This forcing move will either win material or force White's king to move, giving me the initiative. The knight is well-supported and safe on f6, making this a strong tactical shot.

One of the strongest moves appears to be:

make_move g4e2

This move attacks White's knight on b1 while maintaining pressure on the center. It develops my bishop to a strong diagonal and creates multiple threats that White will need to address.

The bishop on e2 is particularly active, pinning White's king to the rook on f1. This is a powerful tactical motif I should exploit.

I'll play:

make_move e2f1

This captures White's rook on f1, winning material. Since the White king on e3 cannot recapture due to the pin (it would expose itself to check from my rook on b8), this is a clean material gain. This should give me a significant advantage in the game.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

After analyzing the position and the available legal moves, I see several strong options. The most critical feature is that my bishop on f1 is attacking the White king on e5, creating a potential check or tactical opportunity.

I notice I can play Bd6-e5, which would directly attack the White king with my bishop. This would force the king to move and could give me a tactical advantage.

After analyzing the position and available moves, I see several interesting options:

1. I have two bishops (on e4 and f1) and a knight on e5 that are actively placed
2. The white king is exposed on e5
3. I have potential tactical opportunities

One of the strongest moves appears to be moving my bishop from f1 to g2, which would check the white king and potentially lead to a strong attack.

After analyzing the position, I see several strong options. I notice I have two bishops, a knight, and a queen, with a relatively safe king position. 

The knight on e5 is well-placed and can make several threats. I also have my queen on f1 with good mobility. One particularly strong move would be to activate my queen with a check.

I'll play:

make_move f1e1

This move checks the white king on e5, forcing a response. It also controls the e-file and increases my queen's activity. This puts immediate pressure on White and may force a favorable rearrangement of pieces.

You are a professional chess player and you play as black. Now is your turn to make a move. Before making a move you can pick one of the following actions:
- 'get_current_board' to get the schema and current status of the board
- 'get_legal_moves' to get a UCI formatted list of available moves
- 'make_move <UCI formatted move>' when you are ready to complete your turn (e.g., 'make_move e2e4')

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

After analyzing the position, I see that White has made some unusual moves with a rook to a5 and a knight to h5. As Black, I should focus on development and controlling the center.

I'll play a solid developing move that also protects against any potential knight threats:

make_move e7e6

This move:
1. Develops toward controlling the center
2. Opens a diagonal for my bishop
3. Prepares for further development with d7-d5
4. Provides additional protection against any knight threats

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

After analyzing the position, I see several good options. My knight on e5 is well-placed but potentially under threat from White's f-pawn advance. The rook on a6 is an unusual placement that I should address.

I'll develop my bishop and strengthen my central control by:

make_move f8e7

This move:
1. Develops my light-squared bishop
2. Protects my knight on e5
3. Connects my rooks
4. Prepares for castling

This is a solid developing move that improves my position while addressing White's threats.

- White has a rook on b2 that's attacking my b-file
- I have knights on e5 and h5 in active positions
- My king is on g8 with a rook on f8
- My bishop on e7 has several possible moves

Looking at the most promising options:
- My knight on e5 is well-placed and can move to several squares
- I could develop my bishop from e7
- I could castle by moving my king from g8 to h8

Given White's rook on b2 threatening my b-file and the overall position, I think castling would improve my king safety.

1. White has a queen on f3 and a rook on b2, creating some pressure.
2. My king is on g8 with a rook on f8 - I haven't castled yet.
3. I have a bishop on e7 that could be developed.
4. My knight on h5 is active but could be better positioned.

After evaluating the position, I think developing my dark-squared bishop would be beneficial. The move e7g5 (Bishop from e7 to g5) looks strong as it:
- Develops the bishop to an active square
- Puts pressure on White's position
- Improves my piece coordination

You are a professional chess player and you play as black. Now is your turn to make a move. Before making a move you can pick one of the following actions:
- 'get_current_board' to get the schema and current status of the board
- 'get_legal_moves' to get a UCI formatted list of available moves
- 'make_move <UCI formatted move>' when you are ready to complete your turn (e.g., 'make_move e2e4')

After analyzing the position and my legal moves, I see that White's rook on b7 is threatening my position. I need to address this immediate threat while developing my pieces.

One of the strongest moves appears to be developing my knight with a threat: 

make_move h5f4

This move attacks White's queen on f3 while developing my knight to a more active square. If White moves the queen, I'll have time to address the rook on b7. If White captures my knight, I can recapture with a pawn and improve my pawn structure.

After analyzing the position, I see I have several good options as Black. 

I notice that my knight on f4 is very active and can make some strong moves. I also see that my king is currently in the center on g8, and I should consider improving my king's safety.

Looking at the position more carefully, I see that White has a rook on b2 that's attacking my b-pawn, and White's queen is on h5, which could potentially create threats.

One of the strongest moves here is to castle kingside, which would improve my king's safety immediately:

Castling kingside seems like a strong move here as it improves my king safety and connects my rooks. This is typically a priority in the middlegame when it's available.

I can see the current position and my legal moves. Let me analyze the situation:

1. White's queen is on g4, creating pressure on my kingside
2. I have a knight on f4 that's well-positioned and attacking White's e2 pawn
3. White has a rook on b2 and a knight on a3, developing on the queenside
4. My king is on g8, and I need to consider safety

One of the strongest moves I see is to develop my queen to h4, which would:
- Attack White's queen on g4
- Create a queen exchange opportunity
- Relieve some pressure on my position

This looks like the most active and principled response.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

After analyzing the position and legal moves, I see that my queen on h4 is under attack from White's queen on g4. I need to address this immediate threat.

Looking at my options, I can either capture the white queen with h4g4, move my queen to safety, or create a counter-threat.

The move h4g4 (capturing White's queen) seems strongest as it eliminates a powerful enemy piece and improves my material advantage. This is a straightforward queen exchange that should benefit me.

Looking at potential threats and opportunities:
- My queen on g4 is well-positioned and can attack several squares
- My knight on f4 is also centralized and has good mobility
- I should consider improving my king's safety

One strong move would be to improve my king's position by moving it away from the h-file:

After analyzing the position, I see I have my queen on g4 with many possible moves, and a knight on e2 that's also mobile. The position looks somewhat open.

I notice my king on h8 is relatively exposed, and I should consider improving my position. One strong move would be to centralize my queen while maintaining pressure.

I'll move my queen to e4, which attacks the e-pawn, maintains flexibility, and controls important central squares:

I notice I have a knight on e2 that's quite active and threatening White's position. I also see my king is on g8 with my rooks on b8 and f8.

Among my options, developing my knight on e2 to a better square seems strong. The knight on e2 is currently attacking White's king on d4, and I could consider moves like e2c3 or e2g3 to maintain pressure.

I'll choose to move my knight to c3, which attacks White's rook on b1 and maintains pressure in the center.

The knight on c3 has many good options, and I should consider whether to use it tactically or reposition it to a safer square. Looking at the board, moving the knight to e4 seems particularly strong as it attacks the pawn on f2 (which appears to be missing from the board, so White may have moved it) and controls important central squares.

I'll make this move:

- White has a king on c2 and pieces on a1, a3, d3, d4, and f1
- I have a knight on f2 that's currently forking White's king and rook on a1

The knight fork on f2 is a very strong tactical opportunity. I can capture the rook on a1 with my knight, which would be a significant material gain.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

I need to analyze the position carefully before making my move.

I notice that:
- I'm playing as Black with my king on g8
- White has a rook on b4 that's attacking my b-pawn
- I have a knight on h1 that can move
- My kingside is relatively secure with pawns on f7 and g7
- My bishop on c8 is undeveloped

Looking at the available moves, I should prioritize development and king safety. The knight on h1 is oddly placed but can be activated with h1g3 or h1f2.

Given White's rook on b4 threatening my b7 pawn, I should either defend it or make a counterattack that's more threatening. Developing my bishop with Bc8d7 would be good, but that's not in my legal moves list.

I think activating my knight from h1 to g3 is a strong move, as it develops a piece and puts pressure on White's position.

Looking at my options, I think developing my rook on f8 to an open file would be a good move. Moving the f8 rook to e8 would place it on a potentially useful open e-file.

- I'm playing as Black and have a knight on g3 that's very active in White's territory
- My king is on e8 with a rook on each side (b8 and e8)
- White's king is on c3, somewhat exposed

Among my options:
- I could castle with e8g8 (kingside castling)
- My knight on g3 has several strong moves, particularly e4 which would fork White's king and pawn
- I have various pawn advances available

The knight fork with g3e4 looks particularly strong as it attacks White's king on c3 and the pawn on d6 simultaneously. This is a tactical opportunity I should take advantage of.

I notice that:
- My king is on e8 with a rook on a8 and e8, suggesting I can still castle kingside (e8g8)
- I have a knight on e4 that's quite active in White's territory
- The pawn structure is relatively intact
- White has a rook on a1 and a4, with the king on b4 which is quite exposed

Given White's king position on b4, my knight on e4 is very powerful. I can consider moves like e4c3 which would attack White's king and a pawn simultaneously.

Alternatively, castling kingside with e8g8 would improve my king safety and connect my rooks.

After evaluating the options, I believe the best move is to castle kingside, which improves my king safety and activates my rook.

The position looks complex. I have my king on g8 with a rook on h8 and a8, bishop on c8, and a knight on e4. My e4 knight is quite active and could be a strong piece.

Looking at the legal moves, I notice my knight on e4 has several good options. It can attack White's bishop on d2 with e4f2, or potentially create threats with e4g5 or e4c5.

Given that my knight is already in a good central position and can create threats, I'll use it to attack White's bishop on d2.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

Looking at the board and my legal moves, I need to make a strategic decision as Black.

I notice I have a knight on e5 that's quite active and has several good options. My king is on g8 with the rook on h8. White's king is exposed on a3, which could be relevant.

Among my options, developing my knight to f3 looks particularly strong - it attacks White's bishop on b4 and puts pressure on White's position. This knight move would be a fork, threatening both the bishop and potentially creating tactical opportunities.

After analyzing the position, I see that I'm playing as Black with my king on g8. White's king is on a3, and I have a knight on f3 that has several good options.

I notice my knight on f3 is attacking White's bishop on b4, which is undefended. Capturing this bishop would be a material gain.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

I apologize for the error. Let me check the legal moves again and make a valid move.

Looking at the list of legal moves, I see that my knight on f3 can't actually capture the bishop on b4 (that was my mistake in reading the board). Let me choose a strong move from the available options.

The knight on f3 has several good options. Moving it to d4 would be a strong centralized position that attacks multiple squares.

2. I have a knight on c3 that has multiple potential moves
3. White's king is exposed on a4, which could be tactically significant

The knight on c3 is particularly active and could be used for a tactical strike. One of the strongest moves appears to be:

make_move c3e4

This knight move to e4:
- Attacks White's knight on d6
- Creates a fork threatening both the knight on d6 and potentially the pawn on e5
- Improves my knight's position to a more central square
- Maintains pressure in the center of the board

This should create immediate tactical threats while improving my piece positioning.

1. The safety of my knight on e4
2. Potential development of my pieces
3. King safety

The knight on e4 is quite active and has many options. One particularly strong move would be to play Ne4-f6, which:
- Controls important central squares
- Protects my king
- Maintains my knight in a strong central position

I'll make this move:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

After analyzing the position and my legal moves, I'll make a decision.

I notice that my king is on g8 and I have a knight on f6 that has several good options. The white king is exposed on a4, which is unusual, but I don't have an immediate attack on it.

Looking at my options, I think developing my knight to e4 would be strong - it controls central squares and puts pressure on White's position. This knight move would improve my piece activity and control of the center.

- My king is on g8 with rooks on b8 and h8

The knight on e4 looks particularly strong, and I should consider how to best use it. The move e4f2 would fork White's king and bishop, winning material. This is a tactical opportunity I shouldn't miss.

I notice several interesting features:
- My king is on g8 with a rook on h8
- I have a knight on f2 that's quite active in White's territory
- White's king is exposed on b4
- White has a bishop on b4 and a knight on b6

Looking at my options, the knight on f2 has several strong moves. I can either:
1. Attack White's king with Nf2-d3+ or Nf2-e4+
2. Move to g4 which controls important squares
3. Move to h3 which is safer but less active

Given the exposed position of White's king, I'll play a check:

- My king is on g8 with castling no longer available
- The pawn structure is relatively intact

One of the strongest moves appears to be moving my knight from e4 to f6, which develops the piece to a good square, controls important central squares, and prepares for potential attacks.

- White's king is on b4, somewhat exposed
- White has a bishop on d6 that's attacking my e-pawn
- I have a knight on f6 that has several possible moves

Looking at my options, I should prioritize safety and development. The e6 pawn is under attack from the white bishop on d6, so I should consider protecting it or moving it forward.

Moving the e-pawn forward with e6-e5 looks like a good move as it challenges the bishop and gains space in the center.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

I can see the position now. As Black, I have a knight on e4 that has several good options. I also notice that White has a bishop on f6 that's threatening my position, and the White king is on b4.

Looking at the available moves, I should consider:

1. The knight on e4 has many options - particularly e4f6 would capture the White bishop
2. Pawn moves to develop my position or create threats
3. King safety with g8f8

The most immediate concern is the White bishop on f6. Capturing it with my knight would be a material gain.

I can see the current position and my legal moves. This appears to be a complex middlegame position where:

- My king is on g8
- White's king is on b4
- I have a knight on f6 that has several possible moves
- I need to consider both my safety and potential attacking opportunities

After analyzing the position, I'll make a move with my knight on f6, which seems to be my most active piece. Moving it to e4 looks strong as it attacks the center and potentially creates threats.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Now I have a clear picture of the position and my available moves. Let me analyze the situation:

I'm playing as Black and I notice:
- My king is on g8 with a rook on each side (a8 and h8)
- I have a knight on e4 that has many possible moves
- White's king is on b4, quite exposed
- White has a bishop on f6 that's attacking my position

Looking at my options, I should consider:
1. Knight moves that could create threats or improve my position
2. Pawn moves to strengthen my structure
3. King safety

The knight on e4 is well-placed and has many options. Moving it to f6 would attack White's bishop on f6, but would also block my f-pawn.

I think a good move would be to develop my knight to c3, which attacks White's a-pawn and puts pressure on that side of the board.

After analyzing the position, I can see that:

1. My king is on g8 with a rook on h8 and another on b8
2. White's king is on b4, quite far advanced
3. I have a bishop on c8
4. White has a bishop on f6 and a knight on c3

Looking at my legal moves, I need to consider both safety and potential counterplay. The most pressing issue is that my king's position could be vulnerable.

I'll play a solid move to improve my king's safety:

make_move g8f8

This move gets my king away from the h-file and maintains a solid position. It's a prudent defensive move that keeps my options open while I assess the position further.

3. My king is on g8 with a relatively safe position
4. There's a white knight on c3 and a white rook on c1

Given the exposed position of White's king, I should look for tactical opportunities. The e5 pawn is advanced and could be useful. I think advancing this pawn to put pressure on White's position would be good.

Given White's vulnerable king position, I should look for ways to attack or prepare an attack. Opening the b-file with my pawn could be strong, allowing my rook to target White's king.

- I have a rook on f8 and b6, a bishop on c8, and my king on h8
- White has a king on b4, a knight on e5, and a rook on c1
- The pawn structure is relatively intact with some advances

Key considerations:
1. Safety of my king
2. Activity of my pieces
3. Control of key squares
4. Potential threats from white

One strong move would be to activate my rook on b6 by moving it to the 8th rank, creating a strong back rank defense and potentially setting up threats along the back rank.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

After analyzing the position, I see that I'm playing as Black with my king on h8. The White king is on c3, and there's a White knight on e4 that could be threatening some of my pieces. I also have rooks on b8 and f8, and a bishop on c8.

Looking at my options, I should prioritize safety and development. One strong move would be to connect my rooks by moving my king to g7, which also gets it away from the back rank.

You are a professional chess player and you play as black. Now is your turn to make a move. Before making a move you can pick one of the following actions:
- 'get_current_board' to get the schema and current status of the board
- 'get_legal_moves' to get a UCI formatted list of available moves
- 'make_move <UCI formatted move>' when you are ready to complete your turn (e.g., 'make_move e2e4')

Player_Black (to Proxy):

I need to analyze the position carefully before making my move.

Looking at the board, I notice:
- White's king is on c3, somewhat exposed
- My king is on g8 with good pawn protection
- I have both rooks and a bishop active
- White has a knight on e4 and a rook on c1

I see several promising options:

1. Developing my rook with f8e8 or f8d8 to control the e-file
2. Moving my bishop with c8b7 to aim at White's kingside
3. Moving my b8 rook to activate it

After consideration, I'll develop my bishop to b7 where it will target White's king position along the long diagonal and coordinate well with my other pieces.
