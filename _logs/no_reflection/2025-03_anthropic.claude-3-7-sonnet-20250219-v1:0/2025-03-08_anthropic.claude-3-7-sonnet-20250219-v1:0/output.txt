Now I can see all my legal moves. Let me analyze the position:

White has played a3 and b4, which is an unusual opening. As Black, I've already played e5. I should focus on development and control of the center.

The most principled move here would be to develop a knight to f6, which controls the center, prepares for castling, and follows good opening principles.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

I can see the current position and my available moves. This appears to be a position from the opening phase of the game.

Looking at the board:
- White has developed a knight to c3 and pushed pawns to b4, f4
- As Black, I've developed both knights (to c6 and f6) and pushed my e-pawn to e5
- The position looks like it could be from a Sicilian Defense or similar opening

I'll analyze some key candidate moves:
- e5e4: Advancing the e-pawn could gain space but might create weaknesses
- d7d5: Classical central counter-play
- f8e7: Developing the bishop to a natural square
- c6d4: Knight to an active central square

The knight move to d4 looks particularly strong as it attacks the f3 square and puts pressure in the center. It can't immediately be captured by a pawn.

After analyzing the position, I can see I'm playing as Black in what appears to be a position from the opening phase. White has developed their knight to e4, and I have knights on f6 and d4.

I notice my knight on d4 is attacking White's knight on e4, which is a strong central position. I should consider capturing it with Nxe4. This would give me control of the center and remove one of White's developed pieces.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

I apologize for the error. Let me check the legal moves again and make a valid move.

Looking at the list of legal moves, I see that "d4e4" isn't actually legal, which means the knight on e4 must be protected. Let me reconsider the position.

Since my knight on d4 is in a strong central position and can't capture the knight on e4, I'll make another strong developing move. One good option is to develop my dark-squared bishop to e7, which protects my king and prepares for castling.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

I need to analyze the position carefully. 

I notice I have the option for castling kingside with "e8g8" which is often a good move to secure king safety. The position looks suitable for castling as:
1. My king is still on e8 and my h8 rook is in place
2. The path is clear (f8 and g8 squares are empty)
3. My king isn't in check
4. Castling will connect my rooks and improve king safety

I also have a knight on d4 that's well-positioned in the center and could potentially fork pieces.

However, kingside castling is a priority in this middlegame position to secure my king and connect my rooks.

- My knight on d4 is well-placed and attacking several squares
- I have a bishop on e7 and a knight on f6 that could be developed further

One of the strongest moves here would be to capture the e5 pawn with my knight from f6, which would gain material and open up the position. This is a standard capture in many openings when White advances too aggressively.

You are a professional chess player and you play as black. Now is your turn to make a move. Before making a move you can pick one of the following actions:
- 'get_current_board' to get the schema and current status of the board
- 'get_legal_moves' to get a UCI formatted list of available moves
- 'make_move <UCI formatted move>' when you are ready to complete your turn (e.g., 'make_move e2e4')

I see the current position. Let me analyze what's happening:

1. White has a pawn on e5, a knight on e4, and a pawn on b4
2. Black has a knight on d4 and a bishop on e7
3. The position looks like some variation of an open game

Let me check what legal moves I have available.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

After analyzing the position and legal moves, I'll make my decision.

The knight on d4 is well-placed and attacking White's knight on e4. I should consider developing more pieces and improving my position.

One strong move would be to develop my bishop with Bf6, challenging White's advanced e5 pawn. This would increase pressure on the center and potentially win material.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

After analyzing the position, I see several key elements:

1. I'm playing as Black and have a knight on d4 that's very active in White's position
2. White has a knight on e4 that's currently undefended
3. My king is castled kingside and my pieces are reasonably developed

Among my options, capturing the undefended knight on e4 with my knight stands out as the strongest move. This would win a piece for free.

However, I don't see "d4e4" in my legal moves list, which suggests the knight on e4 might actually be a pawn (the board representation can sometimes be confusing with symbols). Looking again, I see it's indeed a pawn on e4.

In that case, I'll play my knight to f3, which attacks White's g1 rook (which appears to be on h1 in the diagram) and puts pressure on White's position.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Thank you for providing the legal moves. Let me analyze the position:

I notice that:
- White has advanced a knight to e4 and I have a knight on f3 that's attacking it
- I have two bishops developed (f6 and f8)
- My king is on g8 and I haven't castled yet
- White's king is on f2, which is somewhat exposed

Looking at my options, I see several strong candidate moves:

1. Taking the knight on e4 with my knight (f3xe4)
2. Developing my queen's rook (a8b8)
3. Moving my knight to other squares like h4 or d4
4. Advancing pawns to improve my position

The capture of the knight on e4 seems most appealing as it wins material without any obvious drawbacks. This would give me a material advantage.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

I apologize for the error. Let me check the UCI format more carefully. In UCI notation, the move should specify the exact starting and ending squares. Let me try again with the correct format.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

I apologize for the confusion. Let me double-check the legal moves list you provided:

"g8h8,f8e8,d8e8,d8e7,a8b8,f6e7,f6g5,f6e5,f6h4,f3g5,f3e5,f3h4,f3d4,f3h2,f3d2,f3g1,f3e1,h7h6,g7g6,d7d6,c7c6,b7b6,a7a6,h7h5,g7g5,d7d5,c7c5,b7b5,a7a5"

I see the issue now. Looking at the legal moves, I can see that f3e4 is not listed as a legal move. The knight on f3 can move to several squares (g5, e5, h4, d4, h2, d2, g1, e1) but not to e4.

After reviewing the position again, I see that e4 is already occupied by White's knight. I want to capture that knight, so the correct move would be:

I'll respond with one of the main responses to 1.d4, which is to play 1...d5. This establishes control of the center and leads to solid positions. It's a classical response that gives Black good chances for equality.

White has played a modest opening with 1.a4 and 2.d3, which isn't particularly aggressive or threatening. As Black, I should focus on solid development and controlling the center.

One of the strongest moves here would be 1...Nf6, developing a knight to a good square that controls the center and prepares for kingside castling. This is a standard developing move that follows good opening principles.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

After analyzing the position and my available legal moves, I'll make a strategic decision.

I should continue my development. My knight is already on f6, and I need to develop my other pieces and potentially castle. Looking at the legal moves, developing my dark-squared bishop or my queenside knight would be good choices. I could also castle kingside since that option is available.

Given that White has weakened the kingside with g4, I think castling kingside is a good choice to secure my king and connect my rooks.

After analyzing the position, I see that I'm playing as Black in what appears to be an opening position where both sides have developed some pieces. White has developed the light-squared bishop to e3, pushed some central pawns, and has a pawn on a4.

I have several good developing moves available. Since I already have pawns on e5 and d5 controlling the center, I should continue development. My knight on f6 is already developed, so I should focus on developing my other pieces.

One of the strongest moves here would be to develop my knight from b8 to c6, which would support my central pawns and develop a piece.

I'll develop my dark-squared bishop to e6, which is a natural developing move that controls important central squares and prepares for castling.

I need to analyze the position carefully before making my move.

Looking at the board, I see we're in the middle game with an interesting position. I notice:
- Both kings are still on their original squares
- I have two knights developed (c6 and f6)
- My dark-squared bishop is on e6
- I have central pawns on d5 and e5
- White has a bishop on e5 and a knight on f5

One strong move I see is to develop my light-squared bishop with Bf8-e7, which would:
1. Complete my kingside development
2. Prepare for castling
3. Connect my rooks

This is a natural developing move that improves my position and prepares kingside castling.

I'll analyze the position to make a strong move as Black.

I notice I'm in a middle game position with a fairly developed position. Looking at the board:
- My king is castled kingside
- I have two bishops and two knights developed
- There's a pawn structure in the center with my pawns on d5 and e5

Let me consider some key candidate moves:

1. e5e4 - Advancing my central pawn could gain space and challenge White's position
2. e6f5 - Moving my bishop to a more active diagonal
3. c6d4 - Knight to d4 would be a strong central outpost
4. e6g4 - Bishop to g4 could pin a knight or create pressure

The move e5e4 looks particularly strong as it advances my central pawn, gains space, and could open lines for my pieces. This is a typical plan in many openings to challenge the center.

After analyzing the position, I can see I'm playing as Black in what appears to be a complex middlegame position. I have developed my knights to c6 and f6, bishops to e7 and e6, and have a pawn on e4 that's quite advanced.

Looking at the legal moves, I notice a few key considerations:
- My king safety is important
- I should consider the value of my advanced e4 pawn
- I need to continue developing my pieces effectively

One strong move is to develop my rook to c8, connecting my rooks and preparing for action on the c-file:

I see that my e7 bishop is attacking the white bishop on g5, and I also have a pawn on e4 that could be vulnerable. My knights are well positioned on c6 and f6.

One strong move would be to develop my dark-squared bishop with e7d6, which improves my piece activity while maintaining protection of key squares. This bishop will be more active on d6 than on e7.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

After analyzing the position, I see several good options. I notice I have a well-developed position with both knights and bishops active. 

One strong move would be to develop my rook to f8, connecting my rooks and preparing for central play. This is a natural developing move that improves my position.

After analyzing the position and my available moves, I'll make a move.

I notice I have a standard King's Indian Defense setup with pawns on e4 and d5. White has developed pieces to the center and kingside. I should continue my development and strengthen my position.

One of the strongest moves here would be to develop my knight to a more active position. The knight on f6 can move to g4, putting pressure on White's bishop on e3 and potentially threatening the f2 square.

2. White has bishops on d4 and g7, and a knight on f6
3. My king is still in the center on e8

One of my strongest moves appears to be using my knight on e3 to attack White's queen on d1. This would create a powerful fork between the queen and rook on a1.

After analyzing the position, I see several good options. I notice my knights are active, my bishops are developed, and I have control of the center with pawns on e4 and e5.

One strong move is to develop my rook to g8, preparing for potential kingside play while maintaining a solid position.

After analyzing the position and available moves, I see several good options. I notice I have a well-developed position with both knights active and bishops on good diagonals.

One strong move would be to activate my queen with `d8f6`, which would put pressure on White's position and potentially threaten some tactical opportunities.

Another good option is to continue development with `c8b8` connecting my rooks.

Given the current position, I'll choose to activate my queen with a move that increases my control of the center and creates threats.

1. White has a knight on g5 threatening my queen on f6
2. I have two knights (g4 and e3) that can potentially make strong moves
3. My king is in the center and could benefit from castling

The most pressing issue is protecting my queen from the knight on g5. I can either move the queen or capture the knight. Looking at my options, I see that my knight on g4 can capture the knight on g5, which seems like the best immediate move.

I notice that my king is on e8 with a rook on each side, and I have two bishops on d6 and e6, a queen on f6, and knights on e5 and e3. The position appears somewhat complex with potential tactical opportunities.

One of the strongest moves I see is to develop my dark-squared bishop with a check:

make_move e6g4

This move accomplishes several things:
1. It puts the white king in check
2. It develops my bishop to a more active square
3. It controls important central squares
4. It increases pressure on the kingside

This aggressive move forces White to respond to the check while I continue to improve my piece coordination.

After analyzing the position, I see several promising options. I notice my queen on f6 has multiple attacking possibilities, and my bishops on d6 and g4 are active. I also have knights on e5 and e3 that could be repositioned.

Looking at the position more carefully, I see that my knight on e3 is attacking the white king on g2. This presents a tactical opportunity. I'll check if I can deliver a check or create a stronger threat.

The move Ne3-f1+ looks particularly strong as it's a knight fork attacking both the white king and rook on a1.

After analyzing the position, I see several strong options. I notice my king is on e8 with a rook on each side, and I have active pieces including two bishops, two knights, and a queen.

One of the most important moves I see is protecting my bishop on g4, which appears to be under attack. I also notice tactical opportunities with my knights and queen.

I'll play the knight move e5f3, which attacks White's king on g1 while also threatening the pawn on d4. This creates a strong tactical threat.

I notice my bishop on g4 has good diagonal control, and I have knights on f1 and f3 that can be activated. My queen on f6 is well-positioned, and I have a passed pawn on e4.

One of the strongest moves I see is to bring my knight on f1 into the game with a threat:

After analyzing the position and the available legal moves, I see several strong options. I notice I have two knights on f3 and g3, a bishop on g4, and my queen on f6. The position looks quite active for Black.

I'll play a strong move that increases my control of the center and puts pressure on White's position:

make_move f3d4

This knight move to d4 is excellent because:
1. It occupies a strong central square
2. It attacks White's pawn on c2
3. It creates threats against White's position
4. It improves my piece coordination

This is a typical knight maneuver in the middlegame that strengthens my position and creates concrete threats.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

I need to analyze this position carefully. I'm playing as Black, and I see that I have very limited legal moves - only 5 options, all involving my king.

The position is quite complex with both sides having active pieces. My king is currently on e8, and I can move to f8, f7, e7, d7, or I can capture a piece on c7 with d6c7 (though this appears to be a notation error since d6 has a black bishop, not a piece that can capture on c7).

Looking at the board:
- White has knights on b7 and f7, putting pressure on my king
- I have rooks on a8 and h8
- My queen is on f6
- I need to ensure my king's safety

Given the limited options and the pressure on my king, I'll move my king to f8, which seems to be the safest square away from the white knights.

After analyzing the position and the available legal moves, I'll make my decision.

I notice I have a strong attacking position with my queen on f4 and bishops on d6 and g4. My knights are also active on d4 and g3. 

Looking at the available moves, I see an opportunity to increase the pressure with my queen. The move f4e3 looks particularly strong as it attacks White's e-pawn while maintaining control of important squares.

After analyzing the position and the available legal moves, I see several strong options. 

I notice I have a bishop on d6 that can attack the white king's position by moving to f4. This would put pressure on the g2 square where the white king is located. Additionally, I have a queen on e3 that can coordinate with my other pieces.

I'll make a strong move that increases pressure on White's king position:

f8g8,f8g7,f8f7,f8e7

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

I see that I'm playing as Black, and I have a very limited set of legal moves. The only moves available are for my king on f8:
- f8g8: King moves to g8
- f8g7: King moves to g7
- f8f7: King moves to f7
- f8e7: King moves to e7

Looking at the board, I notice:
- I'm in a difficult position with White's knights on c7 and f7 restricting my king's movement
- My king is currently on f8, and I need to find the safest square
- Moving to g8 would keep me in the back rank and maintain connection with my rook on h8
- Moving to g7 would expose me to potential checks
- Moving to f7 would be directly into a White knight
- Moving to e7 might expose me to other threats

The safest move appears to be:

One of the strongest moves appears to be protecting my king while maintaining control of the center. I'll move my king to safety:

I'm playing as Black and have several key pieces: a rook on d8, my king on f7, a queen on e5, and bishops on f4 and g4, plus knights on d4 and g3.

Looking at my options:
- f7g8: King to g8
- f7f8: King to f8
- f7g7: King to g7
- f7e7: King to e7
- d8h8: Rook from d8 to h8

The move d8h8 stands out as particularly strong. I can capture White's knight on h8 with my rook. This is a free piece capture that would significantly improve my material advantage.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

After analyzing the position, I see that I'm playing as Black and have several interesting options. 

I notice that my king is on f7, and I have a rook on h8 that could be better utilized. I also have knights on d4 and g3, and bishops on f4 and g4.

One of the strongest moves here would be to centralize my rook with:

make_move h8e8

This move activates my rook along the e-file, which appears to be open. It puts pressure on the center, increases my rook's mobility, and prepares for potential attacks. The rook will be much more effective on e8 than sitting in the corner on h8.

I'll move my rook from e8 to e5, which puts pressure on White's position and controls important central squares.

I can see the current board position. This appears to be a complex middlegame/endgame position where I'm playing as Black. I have my king on f8, rook on e5, two bishops on f5 and g5, and knights on d5 and g3. Let me check what legal moves I have available.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

I see that my legal moves are limited to king moves: f7g8, f7g7, f7e7, and f7f6.

Wait, there seems to be a discrepancy. The board shows my king on f8, but the legal moves suggest my king is on f7. Looking at the board again, I can see that my king (♚) is indeed on f8, not f7.

Let me analyze the position carefully:
- White has a rook on f6 that's checking my king on f8
- I need to get out of check
- My options appear to be limited to moving my king

Based on the legal moves provided, I'll choose to move my king to g7, which gets me out of check and maintains protection of my h8 pawn.

After analyzing the position and legal moves, I can see I'm playing as Black with my king on g7. I have several active pieces including rooks, knights, and bishops. 

I notice my knight on d4 has several good options, and my rook on e5 is also active. Looking at the position, I should prioritize either improving my piece activity or increasing pressure on White's position.

The knight on d4 seems particularly well-placed and can make several strong moves. Moving it to f5 would create pressure on White's position while developing toward the kingside where White's king appears to be (on f2).

1. I notice I have a rook on e5 that's currently under attack by a white rook on f6.
2. I have two bishops on g4 and f4, and two knights on f5 and g3.
3. My king is on g7.

Looking at the available moves, I need to prioritize:
- Addressing the threat to my rook on e5
- Finding any tactical opportunities
- Improving my position

The rook on e5 is my most pressing concern since it's under attack. I can either move it to safety or defend it. Moving it to e7 or e8 seems reasonable.

I also notice my knight on f5 has several good options, including a potential fork with Nd4 that could attack multiple pieces.

After careful consideration, I'll move my rook to safety while maintaining its activity:

2. My king on g7 is somewhat exposed with a white rook on f6
3. I have strong bishop pair on f4 and g4
4. There's a tactical opportunity with my bishop on f4

The move f4c7+ stands out as a strong check that attacks White's undefended rook on a5. This creates a fork between the white king and rook.

I see the current position and my legal moves. Let me analyze the situation:

1. I'm playing as Black and my king is on g7
2. White has a rook on f6 that's checking my king
3. I have a bishop on g5 and knights on f5 and g3
4. White's king is on e1

Looking at my legal moves, I need to address the check from the rook on f6. My options are:
- Move my king (g7h8, g7g8, g7f7, g7h6, g7g6)
- Block with my rook (e7f7)

The best move appears to be to capture the checking rook with my rook:

Since moving the rook to f7 would block the check and protect my king, I'll choose that move:

I notice I have two bishops (on c7 and g4), two knights (on f5 and g3), and a rook on f7. My king is on g7, and I have several pawns.

One strong move would be to develop my bishop on c7, which is currently not very active. Moving it to e5 would place it on a strong diagonal, controlling important central squares.

I'll make a move with my bishop on e5, developing an attack:

One strong move would be to develop my bishop on f4 to e5, which would control important central squares and put pressure on White's position.

After analyzing the position, I can see I'm playing as Black and have several pieces including my king on g7, a rook on f7, bishops on e5 and g4, knights on f5 and g3, and various pawns.

The position looks complex with attacking possibilities. My king on g7 appears to be relatively safe, and I have active pieces. Let me consider my best options:

1. The bishop on e5 has several good moves, including the diagonal to c7 which could threaten White's position.
2. The knight on f5 has tactical possibilities.
3. My rook on f7 could be developed further.

I think the most active move is to place my bishop on c7, which controls important squares and increases my piece activity.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

After analyzing the position and the available legal moves, I can see I'm playing as Black and have several interesting options.

I notice I have two knights (on f5 and g3), two bishops (on e5 and h5), a rook on f7, and my king on g7. White has a rook on a6 and king on b6.

Looking at the position tactically, I see that my knight on g3 can deliver a strong move:

make_move g3e2

This knight move to e2 creates a fork, attacking both White's rook on a6 and potentially threatening the king's position. This is a strong tactical move that should gain material advantage.

After analyzing the position and available moves, I can see I'm playing as Black with my king on g7. I have several pieces including rooks, knights, and bishops, with material appearing roughly equal.

Looking at the legal moves, I notice a few key opportunities:
- My knight on e2 has several good options
- My bishop on f5 can move to various squares
- My king on g7 can move to safety

Given the exposed position of my king, I should prioritize safety while maintaining active piece coordination. The knight on e2 seems well-placed to create threats, so I'll move it to g3, which attacks potential squares and improves my piece activity.

- My knight on g3 is attacking squares near the white king
- My bishop on e5 controls important central squares

I'll play a strong move with my knight on g3, putting pressure on the e2 square which could be a key attacking point:

One of the strongest moves I see is to activate my knight on e2, which can move to c3 where it would attack White's rook on b2 while also controlling important central squares.

The position looks complex with potential tactical opportunities. Let me evaluate some key options:

1. Knight moves from f5 could create threats
2. Bishop on h5 has several diagonal options
3. My king on g7 has multiple safe squares
4. The bishop on g3 has good diagonal control

I think one of the strongest moves is to improve my bishop position with:

make_move g3e5

This move places my bishop on a strong central square, controlling important diagonals and putting pressure on White's position. The e5 square gives the bishop excellent scope and creates threats along the a1-h8 diagonal.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

After analyzing the position and the available legal moves, I need to make a strategic decision.

I notice I have several pieces under attack - particularly my knight on e2 is attacked by the white rook on d2. I also have active bishops on e5 and h5, and my king on g7 appears relatively safe.

One of the strongest moves available is to move my bishop from e5 to capture on c7, which would win material:

After analyzing the position and available moves, I can see I'm playing as Black with several pieces including my king on g7. I have two knights (on e2 and f5), two bishops (on c7 and h5), and a rook on f7.

I notice my king on g7 is somewhat exposed, and I should consider improving its safety. I also see opportunities to develop my pieces more actively.

One strong move would be to develop my bishop on c7 to a more active diagonal where it can control more squares and potentially create threats.

I need to carefully analyze this position. I'm playing as Black and need to make a strong move.

Looking at the board:
- I have my king on g7 with a rook on f7
- I have knights on f5 and e2
- I have bishops on h5 and f4
- White has a rook on c7 threatening my a7 pawn

The most pressing issue is the White rook on c7 attacking my a7 pawn. I should either defend it or make a stronger counterattack.

I notice I have a bishop on h5 that could potentially deliver a check by moving to g6, which would attack the white king on b2. This looks like a strong move that creates immediate threats.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

I see my legal moves. Let me analyze the position:

I'm playing as Black and I notice:
- My king is on g7
- White has a rook on f6 that's putting my king in check
- I have bishops on g6 and f4, and knights on f5 and e2
- White's king is on b1

Since my king is in check from the rook on f6, I must address this immediately. My options are:
1. Move the king (g7h8, g7g8, g7f7, g7h6)
2. Block with the bishop (g6f7)

The best move appears to be g7h8, moving my king to the corner where it's safer from checks. Moving to g8 would keep me on the same file as the rook, f7 would put me in line with White's pawn on b7, and h6 would be more exposed.

I notice a few strong options:
1. I can capture the rook with my knight: e2f4
2. I can move my bishop to f6 to protect the e5 pawn: e5f6
3. I can advance my d-pawn: d5d4

The best move appears to be capturing the rook with my knight, as it removes White's most active piece without any immediate drawbacks.

Now I have a clear picture of the position and my available moves. Let me analyze the situation:

1. I have a significant material advantage with two bishops, a knight, and four pawns against White's three pawns.
2. White's king is isolated on b1, while my pieces are more centralized.
3. I should look for the strongest continuation to press my advantage.

Looking at my options:
- My bishop on e5 controls important diagonals and threatens to penetrate deeper
- My knight on f4 is well-positioned and can potentially attack White's king
- I could advance my d5 pawn to d4, strengthening my center control

After evaluation, I believe advancing my d-pawn is a strong move as it controls more central squares and supports my knight's position.

Let me analyze the position and make a strong move as Black.

I see that I'm playing as Black and have several pieces: a king on g6, two bishops on g7 and e5, a knight on f4, and pawns on b7, d4, e4, and h7. White has a king on b1, a knight on a8, and pawns on a4 and e5.

Looking at my options:
- My bishop on e5 has several good moves, including f6 which would attack White's knight on a8
- My knight on f4 has multiple options including e6 which would create a strong central presence
- My bishop on g7 could move to various squares

After evaluating the position, I believe the strongest move is to move my bishop from e5 to f6, which attacks White's knight on a8 while maintaining good control of the center.

I have several strong options here. My knight on f4 is particularly active and could create threats. My two bishops are also well-positioned on the kingside.

Looking at the available moves, I think the knight move f4e6 is particularly strong. This centralizes my knight, controls important squares, and creates potential threats against White's position.

I need to analyze the position carefully. I see that I'm playing as Black and have my king on g7, with knights on e6, bishops on f6 and g6, and pawns on b7, e4, and h7.

Looking at the legal moves, I need to consider both safety and activity. My king appears to be somewhat exposed, so king safety is a priority. I also notice White has a knight on c7 that could be threatening.

After evaluating the position, I'll play a move that improves my king's safety while maintaining control of key squares.

Thank you for providing the legal moves. Now I can analyze the position and make a decision.

Looking at the position, I notice several important factors:
1. I have two bishops and a knight vs White's single knight
2. I have a material advantage
3. My king is relatively safe on f8

Among my options, I see some strong moves:
- I could attack White's knight on c7 with my knight (e6c7)
- I could advance my e-pawn with e4e3
- I could improve my king's position with f8g7

The move e4e3 looks particularly strong as it advances a passed pawn that could become a promotion threat. This pawn is already quite advanced and pushing it further increases its value.

After analyzing the position and my legal moves, I see that I have several strong options. 

I notice I have my queen on e1 with many potential moves, and my bishop on g6 has a long diagonal. My knight on e5 is well-positioned in the center.

One of the strongest moves here would be to use my queen to attack White's undefended king on a2. This would be a direct checkmate.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

I'll analyze the position and make a strong move as Black.

Looking at the board, I see that:
- I'm playing as Black with my king on f8
- I have two bishops (e6 and f6), a knight on g6, and pawns on b7 and h7
- White has a king on a1, a knight on a8, and pawns on a4 and d4

My king is currently on f8, and I notice I can move it to g7 which would be safer than staying on the back rank. This would also free up the f8 square for potential future use by my pieces.

The move Kg7 (f8g7) looks strong as it improves my king's safety and position.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

I need to analyze this position carefully. I'm playing as Black and have several pieces: a king on g7, two bishops on e6 and f6, a knight on g6, and pawns on b7 and h7.

Looking at the legal moves, I need to consider:
1. King safety - my king on g7 has several possible moves
2. Piece coordination - how to best use my bishops and knight
3. Pawn advancement - whether to push either of my pawns

The White king is on a6, quite far from my king, and White has a knight on a8 and pawns on a4 and d4.

Given that I have a material advantage with two bishops and a knight versus White's lone knight, I should focus on activating my pieces. The bishop on e6 can move to g5, which would control more of the board and put pressure on White's position.

Thank you for providing the legal moves. Now I can analyze the position and make a decision.

Looking at the position, I notice several key factors:
- I have two bishops and a knight vs White's lone knight
- My king is safe for now
- I have an opportunity to capture White's d4 pawn with my bishop

Taking the d4 pawn with my bishop from f6 seems like the strongest move as it increases my material advantage without exposing my pieces to immediate danger.

2. Attacking opportunities with my knights and bishops
3. Pawn advancement

The bishop on a1 has a powerful diagonal and can move to f6, e5, d4, c3, or b2. Moving to b2 would capture White's king, which would be checkmate.

As Black, I have:

- Two bishops (on g6 and b2)
- Knight on e4
- Pawn on h7

White has:
- King on b4
- Knight on a8
- Pawn on b7

Let me check what legal moves I have available.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player_Black (to Proxy):

Thank you for providing the legal moves. Let me analyze the position and make the best move.

I notice I have several strong pieces as Black with two bishops, a knight, and my king is relatively safe. Let me consider my options:

1. My knight on e4 is well-positioned and controls several squares.
2. I have two bishops that can exert diagonal control.
3. White's king is exposed on b4.

One of my strongest options appears to be using my bishop on b2 to check the white king. The move b2c3+ would put White's king in check and potentially gain a tempo.

Let me make this move:

Player_Black (to Proxy):

After analyzing the position, I see that I'm playing as Black with a king on g6, two bishops (on g7 and c3), and a knight on e4. White has a king on b2, a knight on a8, and a pawn on b7.

I have several strong options here. My bishop on g7 controls the long diagonal, my bishop on c3 is active, and my knight on e4 is centralized. Let me consider the best move:

1. The knight on e4 has several good options, including e4f6 which would protect my king.
2. My bishop on c3 could move to e5 to control more central squares.
3. My bishop on g7 could move to f6 to protect the king.

I think the strongest move is to move my bishop from c3 to e5, which increases my control of the center and puts pressure on White's position.

After analyzing the position, I see several strong options as Black. I have a material advantage with two bishops and a knight against White's lone knight.

The most decisive move appears to be moving my bishop to a1, which would deliver checkmate. The white king is trapped on a3, and my bishop on e5 can deliver mate by moving to a1, with no way for White to block or escape.

1. I have two bishops, a knight, and a pawn, while White has a king, knight, and pawn.
2. My knight on e4 is centralized and controls several squares.
3. My bishop on g6 is active and could potentially target White's pieces.
4. My bishop on a8 is somewhat passive but has the long diagonal available.

Looking at the tactical possibilities:
- Moving my bishop from a8 to f6 would create a strong diagonal presence and put pressure on White's position.
- My knight on e4 has several good options, including f6 which would protect my king.

After consideration, I'll move my bishop from a8 to f6, which activates this piece, controls important central squares, and provides protection to my king.

3. I notice my knight is on e5 (shown as e4 in the legal moves list, which suggests it's actually on e4).
4. I have opportunities to attack with my bishops and knight.

Looking at the position, one strong move would be to use my knight to fork White's king and knight. From e4, my knight can move to c5, which would attack both White's king on a5 and knight on a8 simultaneously.

1. I could attack White's knight with my knight: c5b7
2. I could advance my pawn: h7h5
3. I could move one of my bishops to a more active position

The move c5b7 stands out as particularly strong because it attacks White's knight on c7 and also threatens the pawn on b7. This would win material.

After analyzing the position, I see that I'm playing as Black with a king on g7, a knight on b7, and two bishops on f6 and g6, plus a pawn on h7. White has a king on a5 and a knight on a8.

I need to make a strong move here. Looking at the legal moves, I notice I have several good options:

1. I could develop my bishop with g6f5 or f6e5, controlling more of the center
2. I could advance my pawn with h7h5
3. I could improve my king's position

The most active move appears to be developing my light-squared bishop to f5, which controls important central squares and adds pressure.

I'll analyze this position carefully before making my move.

I see that I'm playing as Black and have the following material:
- King on g7
- Knight on b7
- Two bishops on f6 and f5
- Pawn on h7

White has:
- King on b4
- Knight on a8

Looking at the legal moves, I need to consider my best options. The most important factors are:
- Safety of my king
- Potential checkmate opportunities
- Material advantage

I notice I have two bishops controlling important diagonals. My bishop on f6 controls the a1-h8 diagonal, while the bishop on f5 controls the a2-h8 diagonal. 

One strong move would be to use my bishop on f5 to check the White king:

I notice I have a very strong position with two bishops and a knight against White's lone knight. My bishop on c2 is particularly powerful, controlling the long diagonal.

I'll move my bishop from c2 to e4, which:
1. Controls more central squares
2. Puts pressure on White's position
3. Maintains control of important diagonals
4. Moves toward White's king, helping to set up a potential checkmate

Player_Black (to Proxy):

After analyzing the position and my available legal moves, I see several strong options:

1. My bishop on e4 is attacking without being defended, so I should consider moving it to safety while maintaining its activity.
2. My bishop on f6 has good diagonals and could be used for attack.
3. My knight on b7 could potentially fork White's king and knight with Nc5.

The move b7c5 (knight to c5) stands out as particularly strong - it directly attacks White's king on c5 and forces an immediate response. This is a check that also threatens White's knight on b6, creating a fork.

4. I have bishops on b7 and f6, and a knight on c5

The bishop on b7 has a powerful diagonal and could potentially be used to control key squares. I'll move this bishop to e4, which:
- Attacks more central squares
- Controls important squares around White's king on b4
- Maintains a strong diagonal
- Creates potential tactical threats

After analyzing the position and my legal moves, I see several strong options:

1. My bishop on f6 can capture White's king on c3 with f6c3
2. My bishop on e4 can also capture White's king on c2 with e4c2

Since capturing the opponent's king would immediately win the game (though in standard chess this doesn't happen as the game ends at checkmate), this must be a variant or puzzle position.

Given the available moves, I'll capture the White king with my bishop.

After analyzing the position, I see that I'm playing as Black with my king on g7 and a pawn on h7. I have two bishops (on e4 and c3) and a knight on c5. White has a king on c4 and a knight on b5.

I notice several strong options:
1. My bishop on e4 controls many diagonals and could deliver a check
2. My bishop on c3 can also move to several good squares
3. My knight on c5 has mobility

The best move appears to be to check the White king with my bishop:

As Black, I have:

- Pawn on h7

White has:
- King on d4
- Knight on b4

Now let me check what legal moves I have available.

Player_Black (to Proxy):

After analyzing the position and my legal moves, I see several strong options. The most critical observation is that my bishop on c3 can capture White's knight on b4, which would give me a material advantage.

Additionally, I notice that my bishop on d3 can check the White king by moving to e4.

Between these two options, capturing the knight is the better choice as it wins material without any immediate counterplay from White.

The most forcing move is to attack the white king with my knight from c5 to e4, which creates an immediate threat. This puts pressure on White and limits their options.

My best move is to use my knight to fork the white king and knight:

make_move e4c5

This knight move to c5 creates a fork, attacking both the white king on e5 and the white knight on c7 simultaneously. White will be forced to move their king, and then I can capture the knight on c7, gaining material advantage.

Looking at the board, I see that my bishop on f5 has good mobility and is currently putting pressure on White's position. I can strengthen my position by moving this bishop to e6, which controls important central squares and creates a stronger coordination between my pieces.
